I find the espresso it makes on the weak side, but my co-workers sharing the machine like it, so I guess it's a matter of taste. Very nice crema.
The book was received promptly and in great shape. Excellent vendor.Charles Muhle
SPIDER LABYRINTH is like a mix of brutal 1970's italian "giallo" meets the "old school" sentiments of the Hammer Horror films. It isn't about the gore (which does get pretty bloody in the last fifteen minutes), but rather it's strengths lie within the pacing and atmosphere. Going for more of a straight forward approach with the story telling, this movie has equal measures of suspense and horror. All of which is mixed together with the right amount of brooding, gothic atmosphere. SPIDER LABYRINTH is truly the unexpected Horror gem of it's genre.Who would have thought this late into the 1980's Horror and Slasher craze that such an imaginable film would slip between the cracks? Heck, I never heard of it until just recently and I consider myself to be pretty well seasoned in the world of Horror! How did this happen!?! SPIDER LABYRINTH is too good of a film to be unknown! Yet, it seems to have fallen into obscurity some how. It's just a shame that this isn't really an official DVD release of the movie. This version is a "print on demand" film. The quality itself isn't too bad. I think it's a VHS to DVD transfer. Still, this is about as good as it gets!When most people think of "giallo" Horror films, such classics as THE BEYOND and SUSPIRIA come to mind. This movie is on the same level as those other films, yet it has a sense of originality on it's own. Like I said before, I never heard of SPIDER LABYRINTH until I started trying to dig up the more obscure films of this genre type. It's not that hard of a movie to find (after all, I did buy my copy online and got it quickly) but it is hard to learn about the actual film. Outside of some online critics, you don't see too much about this movie. SPIDER LABYRINTH isn't as well known as SUSPIRIA or HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY, but it is just as good!The film itself takes elements from ROSEMARY'S BABY, BODY SNATCHERS, THE EVIL DEAD, INFERNO, THE THING and mixes it all with an H.P. Lovecraft vibe to boot! Style wise it kinda' reminds me of the Hammer Horror days, where a lot of attention was given to the set designs (which are amazing here) and all the actors do their best despite the production limitations. SPIDER LABYRINTH might be a little low budget but that doesn't mean everyone involved doesn't do a good job. Also, the music in this film is very creepy and well done. I consider this to be "classic" Horror movie direction.The plot is about this College professor who is sent to Budapest by his school to look for a missing fellow professor. Once he gets there, strange things start happening right off the bat. First of all, a number of people have pulled him aside and told him to escape from the city while he still can. Then a few deaths start cropping up, invovling some pretty unsettling and odd circumstances. Like a man being hung to death with what seems like a huge, thick spider web! Eventually the movie builds up full steam as hideous spider monsters and a secret cult bring everything to a horrifying and bloody climax!This movie does feel more like Hammer Horror than "giallo" but thats no problem really. The mix is a welcome combination and once you finally see the movie, you'll understand why it's so popular. It's just a good 'ol fashioned spooky Horror film with some of the more grizzly aspects (blood and gore) of the late 70's italian Horror scene. It's hard to believe this movie came out during the late 1980's! Gore Hounds, check it out for multiple stabbings, tons of make-up effects and an especially disgusting ending! SPIDER LABYRINTH is truly a hidden Horror gem!Five stars without a doubt!Horror fans, check it out! Unless that is, you don't like spiders!
I, like countless others stranded in front of a TV with basic cable throughout the 80's, grew to love "Where Eagles Dare". "Where Eagles Dare" is not a good war movie. It's not even a good movie movie. Why is it so popular? Because it's loads of fun!With hardly a passing glance at realism, a confusing, ludicrous script, and a series of plot twists "so hackneyed it would make Stan Lee blush" (thank you, Comic Book Guy), "Where Eagles Dare" belongs at the bottom of any stack of war movies that also includes "Saving Private Ryan" or even "Patton". Cruel, simplistic, patrician, it holds dear none of the lessons of wartime comradery, the preciousness of life or the ultimate futility of war that we are made to understand from the popular war movie 'book'. "Where Eagles Dare" begins with untrustworthy spy-movie-Fu, develops irresponsible cruelty, and ends with daring idiocy.So what's good in here, anyway? Clint Eastwood's gruff swagger. Richard Burton's top-spook cunning. The combat scenes, where the very locations become characters and plot devices. The blessed, blessed paucity of dialog; this film's soundtrack is snowy wind ambience, gunfire and musical score, punctuated by brief lines from Burton.The combat scenes in the beginning and middle of the film are excellent; they trade realism for panache, and aren't afraid to put Eastwood against impossible odds, laying it on thick with the grenades and bottomless clips (very few shooting movies have the stones to make up for this particular gaffe). Things start to fall apart near the ending chase scene, but by that point you've sat so long on sweaty hands through the tense getaways and cliffhangers that it doesn't matter how it wraps up. Which is a good thing, since the final scene assures confused viewers that the plot is disposable anyway.This is not a desert island must-have. This is a film to fill a long Saturday afternoon; play it inbetween "Ronin" and "Starship Troopers", not "Schindler's List" and "The English Patient". It's no wonder this film was so popular on TNT and other cable channels in the 80's; it's the just the thing for a brain comfortably in the "off" position.
Joy Chant's Red Moon and Black Mountain was probably my favorite book as a young adult. Though obscure and woefully under acknowledged, this 'modern day people drop into alien world' saga is the absolute BEST of it's ilk. It combines both mysticism and fantasy, battle and intrigue into an absolutely spellbinding story. I truly think this marvellous work is dismissed by many as being another 'Tolkien lite' but the story is so much, MUCH more. Like Tolkien, Ms. Chant is able to define several rich and varied cultures and do so skillfully in the same book - but that is where the similarity ends! The Hurnei bear very little resemblance to Tolkien's horse peoples - and their culture is, in fact, much more richly detailed (in The Grey Mane of Morning - another of Ms. Chant's books in this universe) than Tolkien's Rohirrim.There are images and names in this book that I have kept in my heart for more than 30 years. That of Vir'vachal riding her earth colored pony through the earth, of the flame and gold of Dur'chai's coat, the sweet terror Li'vanh Tuvoi feels when he jumps to his death, the beautiful but terrible face of the fallen Prince of Heaven as he sees the little being who has defeated him. The Dancer at his Fountain... The child 'death-eyed'... I have not laid eyes on this book for more than 20 years and STILL I remember these details! This was a story that sang to me, that made me ache and filled me with joy at the same time. Perhaps I am the only person on the planet for whom this book spoke such volumes, but if I can convince another of its worth, another who would hear this story, these peoples, sing as I have, then it is worth the time I take to write this review.
I love finding Japanese artists that are not mainstream. Unfortunately they are hard to come by in America. This album is definitely one of I's Cube's best. She has a very unique voice that reminds me of Alanis Morissette.
I first heard the A-Lines on pandora - and I was blown away. This is what happens when you mix the Ramones with 60s Garage Rock and add a dose of Elastica - in other words this is an awesome album.1 From the opener, "Four" with its pounding beat and ramones like infectious 3 cord rock to the closer "Last one there" which seems to channel (in a good way) Jethro Tull reimagined as a punk band.If you like the Ramones, or just good driving beats, you owe it to yourself to track down this album.
When I saw the low price for this one, I knew I had to have it. I vividly remember watching Batman on WTBS a long time ago along with its contemporary TV series. One of the things that makes this such a great film is its presentation that makes it enjoyable on multiple levels. When I was a kid I didn't think it was funny but rather thought it was a great action movie featuring the heroic dynamic duo. When I was older and saw it again I realized how hilarious it is.This DVD is fantastic. The movie looks like it was made yesterday instead of the sixties. The commentary from Adam West and Burt Ward is entertaining and there are some nice extras included.With the proliferation of TV series on DVD, I can't help but wonder when we'll see the show released to a waiting public.It may be campy and not the favorite of "true" Batman fans, but I still believe the original is still the best.
The latest from the master of film, Steven Spielberg, Minority Report is a very entertaining film. Minority Report, starring Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell and others, is about a man in the future, who is being hunted for a Pre-Crime he does not believe he will commit. He has a certain amount of time before the pre-crime is supposed to take place, and tries to search for answers before it is too late. (This is a very, extremely, dumbed down version of the synopsis)Spielberg tried to draw on the film noir genre to make the film, and doing this definitely gave the film a much more dark feeling overall. There was a certain sense of mystery to the whole movie, and while it is fairly predictable who the villain is,(there are only a limited amount of main characters in the movie, which is why it is predictable) the ride to get to that point where the movie reveals the villain is altogether thrilling, and visually astonishing.As much as others have said the movie is loaded with action, I have to disagree. The movie has a couple nice action sequences, yes, but in reality, considering the movie's long running time, there weren't that many. The reason why the movie seemed action filled from beginning to end was really because Spielberg truly was able to convey a sense of excitement and intrigue through the dialogue. It reminds me of what the movie "The Beach" wanted to be -a thriller without the action, but where "The Beach" failed, Minority Report has succeeded.That is not to say there aren't some nice scenes with action of course. The one I loved the most was the sequence where John Anderton (Tom Cruise) has to jump from one car to another, while all the cars are going down a literally vertical highway (the futuristic highways remind me of rollercoasters).Many felt that the ending to this was way too drawn out, and similar to Spielberg's last movie AI, should have cut out the last 20 minutes or so. I disagree, as I felt the last part of the movie gave it that finishing touch that makes it even more film noir like.Spielberg has also revealed a darker and more morbid sense of humor that may have come from his tangle with Kubrick in AI. One of the scenes that perfectly illustrates this new Kubrickan Spielberg is one where a man in the movie has to chase after his own eyeballs, bouncing down a hallway -something that is sickeningly funny, and definitely a type of scene that was previously not part of Spielberg's film vocab.Overall, Minority Report is a thoughtful thriller that definitely warrants at least one viewing.
Jacques Pepin returns in a 3 DVD disc set that is a visual companion to his book of the same name, both a sequel to the original series Fast Food My Way. In a way, the Fast Food series are a testament to a long distinguished career, showcasing how all those years and experience can culminate in the most difficult frontier for any master in his craft: simplicity.8 Episodes per disc, each beginning with an idea for a quick, throw-together dish appetizer ("minute" recipes), a warm welcome from Jacques and a 30 minute episode comprising of a 1st course, a main dish, and a dessert. Wine pairings are also gently suggested, with type and region noted.Each show features combinations that are presented as menus at the end of book equivalent. Knowing how to match dishes to compliment the palette is, in itself, an art form.The recipes have an international expanse (although onion, garlic, "good" olive oil, chives, parsley, and sour cream seem to be the recurring staples), ranging from seafood Paella (tried this recipe: delicious!) to baked lobster loafs using hot dog rolls, sauteed mustard greens with spicy Italian sausage, New England style chowder, middle eastern coucous with veggies, pork medallions in pomegranate sauce, tibetan bread (ready in 15 minutes!) shrimp with cabbage and caviar, almond paste Mont Blanc and Salmon Pizza on lavash bread, and my favorite one, potato gnocchi with eggs and truffles. There is also some simple but surprisingly elegant looking desserts that will sure be a delight to guests, ranging from apricot clafoutis to cherries in Armagnac sauce, and a fancy raspberry tart on cookie dough. Daughter Claudine joins him for a few episodes, providing light banter and added familial warmth. You can get a taste of the menu of this 3 dvd set by having a peek at KQED's website's Pepin page.The basis of Pepin's "Fast Food" is the edict that you should look at your supermarket as your prep cook. "Make your supermarket work for you!" So whether it be something as obvious as rotisserie chicken (you make the sauce), cream cheese, prepacked salmon, canned caviar, seedless raspberry preserves, or the controversial truffle oil (which Pepin wisely hints, only contains the "essence" of truffles), jarred alcaparrado, pre-cut lobster tails, salsa, you will wisely cut down on your time by using one or two bought, pre-made items. Also, it helps to pre-prepare some of the ingredients to your fast food, whether it be pre-cut, pre-rinsed onions (to rid it of sulfuric acid), chicken stock, or lamb stew cubes.Keep in mind however, that a big contributing factor to the "fast" in Pepin's fast food is the instructor himself. Head chef to France's president de Gaulle, resume entries from Howard Johnson to the Russian Tea Room, departmental dean of New York's French culinary institute, and cooking professionally for over 60 years, this is also the man who can famously remove every bone from a chicken with merely a slash..AND keep the whole chicken intact... in 20 seconds. As long as you understand this, you won't feel set back when you have to account for just a tad little additional time in the preparation of Pepin's "Fast Foods." Still, consider the time well-spent, because you will definitely be able to dazzle your guests in both taste and presentation. An added treat is seeing some of his complete techniques being demonstrated in practice.Now, a little about Pepin's personality. All great artists train us not only to enjoy beauty in life, but also to find new ways of seeing beauty in our surroundings. Pepin's Masters degree in French poetry certainly contributes to his delight when he comments on the beauty of pieces of vegetables and fruits or his crystalline observation that "the recipe is only the expression of the moment," a comment that instantly aligns cooking with jazz improvisation. His eye for proportion and balance in composition is evident even down to the way he tops a tomato with a garnish or cuts a skirt steak to show you the insides: it's almost painting with food. Yet his instructions are casual and his gentle resonant voice is warm and inviting. Pepin sips coffee or wine at the beginning or end of the shows, adding to the welcoming atmosphere. At one point, you can even hear the film crew chuckling when he winks at the camera and says, "don't tell the guest I ate half his egg."You may be able to watch some of these shows online. But with the dvds' crisp sound quality (the sizzle of a sautee, the knock of knife on chopping block, and of course the instructor's voice) and excellent resolution and definition, the sensual and beautiful pleasures of cooking is a delightful gift from Jacques Pepin and his way.
If you are looking for1. Connecting multiple electrical devices in the car/van etc without having a cigar lighter connector for every device2. Compact equipment to charge your batteries3. Using laptops, cellphones, lights, charge camera/camcorder4. Using it from cigar lighter and Battery directlyHere you have a simple,Cheap and effective solution. This worked for me good. My daughter loved it when she could use her laptop in the van during our 4 hours long drive last time. She could watch DVD, play games etc without any stopping for charging the battery etc...I liked this product and the price was good too.
Sure, the photographs look nice on big glossy oversized spreads... But I have to consider the message of the book, as loosely given in the text that introduces, accompanies, and then summarizes this collection of photos. Although the book will likely impress and inform readers about cultural diversity, unfortunately the text tries to claim how amazingly similar all these patterns are. It tries at every turn to introduce mystical elements and bases this whole approach on an interpretation of psychologist Carl Jung's conception of archetypes and the "collective unconscious." It is really too bad that the editor and commenters were so limited in their approach - tending toward the poetic rather than the analytic - for this book could have served as an introduction to the principles of cultural diffusion, history, culture areas, and other anthropological and sociological concepts and principles. Instead of looking at how the people of Madagascar had travelled from Southeast Asia, or (sometimes forceful) patterns in the spread of the "world religions" caused replacement or hybridization with traditional religions, or how the similarities in indiginous religions are rooted in the similar levels of technology and societal size/type (foragers, horticulturalists, agriculturalists, etc.); this book instead would suggest that similarities between its hand-picked photographs are supposed to show the existence of either God or a collective unconscious. It would have helped for the book to provide a clear definition of the "collective unconscious" that can actually fit in with modern understandings of cultural diffusion, memetics, social systems and cultural evolution. But it didn't; and so there was a large opportunity missed to reveal one of the truly remarkable cultural advances of modern times; that of rational and cumulative scientific endeavors. This book will instead only impress with the proneness of humanity to cling to the irrational. Instead of just a couple of quotes from Jung and Joseph Campbell, this book desperately needs quotations from Freud and Durkheim! Instead, this large tome addresses things at the same level as your average travelogue tv show. It whets the appetite and even feeds you a bit, but the "food" turns out to be candy rather than meat.
I love hot and sour soup and will order it every time i'm at a chinese restaurant. i've been to many chinese restaurants from the cheap hole in the wall to the really upscale. Rarely have I had a hot and sour soup that I didn't like. This soup was NOT at all like any hot and sour soup you will have ever had at a chinese restaurant. So I was pretty disappointed.
Purchased this printer about 3 years from Comp USA. The in-store display printed wonderfully replicated photos. I spent several hundred dollars on this printer and was excited to not have to send out my digital files for printing whenever I wanted just 1 or 2 photos.I admit I was stupid - at the first sign of trouble I should have taken this piece of junk back to the store. Prints regularly had ink stripes up the back which would smear all over print. Also, this problem would regularly occur and would streak to the front of the printed photo. I called Epson and they were no help whatsoever. They told me to manually wipe off the excess ink between prints so that this would not occur -- this was not a realistic solution and was a good indicator of their poor customer service and lack of solutions for flaws with their product.Photos rarely printed well. There would often be streaks and horizontal lines thru my printed photos.There are constantly warbly lines thru just about anything I attempt to print. I've wasted SO many color cartridges just trying to get 1-2 decent prints from photos. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!I've run every single tool for this printer, from cleaning the heads to checking nozzles, etc. I can't believe what a pain it is to simply print a single black and white text page, too.Paper jams were a common problem as well. Also - paper would feed in at an angle and therefore, printed items were often slightly crooked. I've only gotten a handful of good quality prints from this thing.So, after 3 years of headaches, I gave this junk away (for free) and went with a Dell all in one printer, which printed excellent quality photos. I will never buy Epson again.
I'm not going to write a synopsis of this particular book for you since it has been done by other reviewers and done so very well. What I am going to tell you is that if you do pick up this book you will most likely do as I did and have to get the rest. You will feel a need to devour them and find out just how Kate can live in such a inhospitable place (if you don't know what you are doing) These books which are a combination of police procedural and mystery (later books have a tiny tad of romance, but not in the typical way) that feature one of the strongest women protagonists I have ever read about. During this series Kate will suffer adversity like you may never have read about before and there is even one book that very nearly made me give up on the series because it was just so harrowing. But I promise you your curiosity will get the best of you and you WILL go back!With this the first novel in the Kate Shugak series, we learn enough about why Kate has come back to Niniltna . She seems to be in hiding and licking some wounds. But reading the entire series is the only way to get the fullest view of why she is the way she is. Sometimes cranky, quick to judge (yet almost always right) loving, sexy, strong of body and soul and a friend you really want at your back.This is a fascinating read for anyone that dreams of going to Alaska and a special cautionary tale for those that dream of moving there and living nowhere near a big city.Kate suffers from a Grandmother and 'Aunties' that wants her in a more traditional role of the modern Aleuts, while fighting for the Native's rights to land, money, aid etc. But Kate will do what is right and correct - for her while taking a serious stance on what she comes to think of as her 'people' - those who are her friends and family. Don't mess with Kate, she gets even. And especially don't mess with her during "break-up" when the back of winter is finally broken and the river starts thawing!
Find a used second edition. In good shape, because you will wear it out.Probably the most useful reference for a writer in addition to a goodstyle manual. Not just the what but the why - with wonderful examples.
I've been using this daily for 3 months now and have to say that there really is nothing I don't like about it. The previous 4- and 5-star reviews say it all, I would only be repeating, but I just wanted to add that one more person thinks that this is a great coffeemaker.You can order the water filter pods (only, no plastic "cage" and handle) from the HB website BUT I ordered them from partstown.com. Their shipping cost was horrible (almost $14 for a 9-3/8 ounce package shipped ground UPS from 2 states away...) but it was still less than HB because I ordered 8 pods. Do the comparison before ordering replacements, you may save some money.
sting, steve hillage (gong), mike howelet(producer) and nik turner(hawkwind) are here.only 5 songs 1 and 5 are really the same song.buy it if you are a sting completist.great package job!....as for the music....ahhhh thats another story. track 1 and 5 get by, the rest don't :-)...this cd should Be filed UNDER STING !
This book is a pleasure to read, especially for fans of romance. And for fans of Chic Lit. And for fans of funny, witty dialogue full of a surprising amount of social commentary and wisdom for the modern woman. This wonderfully original slant on the old fairy tale examines the barriers we erect for ourselves to stop us from really falling in love. The genius of this book is that it comes back to touch you when you're least expecting it, and you realize how true-to-life Crusie's recipe for love can be!
well, it's my first return to Amazon, followed by my second. This kettle blows steam out the edges of that big opening right onto the handle. Picking it up is risky business. It leaks water. I used to have a Revere kettle I loved, this one is nothing like it.
When I first got it I was disappointed to see how short the handle was. Until I went to use it. Considering how you hole the zester and use your thumb support on the lemon this design is perfect.Very happy with it. The rubber handle helps to give a good purchase on the lemon with out sliding around your hand.
After two months of light use, small spots of rust appeared through the black, vinyl coated wire. Another two months and the dishrack was leaving rusty stains on any dish it touched. My first thought was that this flaw was an isolated one, considering the company RUBBERMAID used to be. When I called the company directly, the rep said, "it happens" and offered a check of 10.00 toward the purchase of another. Eight weeks later...no check...no response from Rubbermaid. So buy their products with the knowledge you're buying junk, and the company is laughing all the way to their bank, which is probably overseas. Good Luck!
I was heartbroken when it was cancelled and became a huge fan of directv when they picked it up for season 3...BUT I just read on [...] (which is linked to Amazon) that they are releasing only the shortened/edited NBC season 3 - not the full episodes aired on directv's Channel 101. AND changing the music for the dvds.Basically, the fans and directv saved this show - and NBC is going to shaft the fans-AGAIN- by releasing shortened episodes instead of full directv episodes. I'm SOOOOOOOOOOOOO MAD. How much more could it really cost to release the entire episodes? And something has to be done to negotiate use of the music up front because fans of all shows usually love the music that was originally chosen by the original creative forces behind the show - rather than after the fact, haphazard changing the music to save money. If you are willing to spend $30 on season 3 (or buy it on sale) - you would probably spend $40 just as easily to get the full episodes with the real music.What a racket! I usually hate 1 star reviews that have nothing to do with the show - but the way it was released(like a volume 1 etc. just to make money) but when the way it is being released means you have no access to the full episodes on dvd-I think it deserves 1 star because it is content related. At least with a volume 1, they may be squeezing you for money but you know you have the option to buy volume 2 and get the entire season. This way, you just get edited episodes - with no hope of full episodes.By the way, it also said there would be a season 4&5 - YAHOO!!
I had really liked some of Doctorow's previous works especially Ragtime, so was anxious to check out his newest work which sounded intriguing. I got the audio book edition, as I usually enjoy listening to these in the car to occupy/save time. Unfortunately I for one was very disappointed in this one. Too much stream of consciousness and random thoughts. Little plot and no involving characters. Couldn't even finish it.
This is my favorite book by Judith M. Riley. I didn't think much of her first book, but I have found that this author has improved with every book. I loved all the characters; they were interesting as well as entertaining. It some aspects, the book had a little "sillyness" thrown about, but this only increased the fun of this book. The way people act in ordinary life is strange- it is fitting that they be just as strange in books! And the little bits of sillyness (I love when the Banker Montavert addresses menander as "monsieur evil head") are perfect bits of surrealism. This book is excellent, truly excellent
Review of lens based on Canon 40D:Be sure you can return it because the first one I got was pure junk. All of the images at 70mm f2.8 where unusably blurry.But wait... after returning it to Amazon (which was quick, return shipping paid, and pain free!!) for another copy of the lens it is very sharp and I would consider it acceptable for any amateur as well as professionals on a budget(such as myself).That being said, I should mention that there is a bit more chromatic aberration than I have seen from other lenses but it's acceptable and can be minimized with smart shooting.CONCLUSION:Don't be scared of the lens but do be sure you can return without hassle. All-in-all I am extremely happy with the results of the second lens.
Don't buy this garbage. It smells bad and it looks like you are just spray painting your head. It's exactly like spray paint except spray paint stays in one area and this garbage goes everywhere. The spray does not stay on your head too long, even if you apply your own hair spray holder. It is very messy. I had residue all over my face, hands, arms, and anything else around me. It just makes you very dirty and you definitely notice it when you shower it all away. When you tilt your head, tiny fragments of the spray fibers will fall everywhere and makes you look like you have a very bad dandruff problem. If you want to have dirty fingernails and embarass yourself and want to know what it feel like to survive an oil spill, use this product.
You know those nights when you're at the video store, and it seems like you've a) seen everything b) only things you haven't seen are movies you couldn't be paid enough to watch? Tonight was one of those nights.Fortunately, I remembered hearing that Liev Schreiber's directorial debut film, 'Everything Will Be Illuminated' was a worthwhile watch. I had been hesitant to watch it because, frankly, the cover image creeped me out, making me think of Elijah Wood's gruesomely freaky character in 'Sin City' - a strange and unfortunate cover choice for this movie.The film was actually superb, and the cover was indeed ill-chosen, for it reflected none of the lovely naturalism of the film itself. Elijah Wood plays a young man, who collects things that remind him of his family. After his grandfather passes, he travels to Ukraine to attempt to find the Shtetl his grandfather left only a week before the Nazi occupation. I don't want to say anything more about the plot, not to ruin the discovery for anyone who hasn't seen it.In short, the movie is artfully and deftly crafted - the director's touch seems so light, one feels like events are really unfolding. The actors, who are all excellent, never seem to be 'acting', and the script is not the usual heavy-handed let's-spoon-feed-and-finger-point-to-our-audience schlock. Schreiber lets the unspoken speak louder than words, and captures the fragile and vivid emotions of his characters. I've always said that the mark of a good writer is that he treats all his characters with tenderness--the entire movie is created with just such love and beauty of spirit. There is even a wonderful dog, "Sammy Davis Jr., Jr.," who is a storyteller in her own right, played by Mickey and Mouse, top dog actors if you ask me.So some night when you wonder which movie you should get, take this one. It is all-round exquisite.
The kids love this, it was a big hit. I would recommend to anyone. I was very satisfied with my purchase. I bought it to match my daughter's sheets. It goes well, and it very sturdy. Love these pillow cases.
This little Cave In single is great (except for it's short lifespan. I wish they had released an EP with at least 4 songs instead of just two, but it will do. Cave In have always been amazing and unique artists and this is just a little showcase of their talent. Especially, on &quot;Lift Off&quot; which will be on repeat for awhile. I suggest buying it, but try someplace where it's a little cheaper. No matter how good, almost 6 bucks (not including shipping) is too much. But this CD is still top-quality.
I came across this CD in a local dance music store. It was a rarity indeed. It was only meant for release in Australia, but it somehow managed to make its way to Washington, DC. I really enjoyed this CD. CD 1 was mixed by Paul Jackson (who I believe was a Ministry of Sound resident DJ at the time) and is just about as house as you can get. Funky and soulfoul with great tracks like &quot;Got the Funk&quot;, &quot;Funk Music&quot; and of course there is Joey Negro's &quot;Can't Get High Without You&quot;. This is one of the best house tracks ever and it put the Subliminal record label on the the map. David Morale's &quot;Needin U&quot; also stands out. CD 1 continues to go strong until &quot;Take Control&quot;. Can someone say cheese? Not one of my favorite house tracks. &quot;Take Control&quot; is one of those tracks that make non-dance music fans look their noses at us.However, the gift of this compilation is CD 2. Mixed by Australian DJ Jayse Knipe, it is includes a variety of dance tracks. Knipe doesn't stick to one genre like his counterpart on CD 2. CD 2 is also darker and less soulful than CD1. Danny Tenaglia's &quot;Elements&quot; is a gem which blends nicely into Mel Ween's &quot;The King.&quot; This is my favorite track on the entire CD. Martin Luther King's famous speech, &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; backed up by a hard-pumping progressive house beat takes the speech to another level. The music seems to enhance and magnify the speech's message. And of course, &quot;Three Drives on Vinyl&quot; stands and Medway's &quot;Engage&quot; is probably my favorite trance track. This was the track that introduced me to the genre in the first place. And the CD ends on a positive note with Paul van Dyk's &quot;Words (for Love). Definitely one of Paul's great accomplishments.This CD is definitely worth getting. However, be prepared to deal with the vastly different approaches from the two DJ's on this compilation. It lacks the continuity that is present on most double CD compilations (even those mixed by two or more different DJs). Yet, it's still a great CD to own.
I would admit, it's a bit too expensive, but overall a great product. My only (persona;) complaint that the led light is way too bright, it lit my whole room which was no longer dark at night. I had to put a patch on the light and it doesn't bother me anymore.
As the five stars indicate, this is as good as it gets. Fits the hose well with no leaks and puts out a good strong narrow blaster stream. Thank goodness they haven't converted to the rot-away brass colored pot metal that we see in so many hose fittings.
Leave it to a Westerner to dumb-down Daoism. It can happen in the East without our help.This is a cute book and could have been a fun read if I didn't understand philosophical Daoism.Let me say that I'm glad that folks love Winnie and company. I do too. I think the characters are great but Daoism doesn't describe them or their lot.The problem with oversimplification is that it ignores and perhaps disparages, deeper values to be realized.Modern Western process philosophy has been coming around to the value of Daoism's ontology and metaphysics for years now, and to reduce these values to Winnie the Pooh is not helpful.I apologize if this offends anybody but just as we tend to make God and/or Jesus sound too much like Santa Claus, the referents are so much more than our fundamentalist beliefs of them.
I purchased the camera as a gift for my husband in July of 2002. As new parents, we expected that we would want a camcorder to record important moments in our children's infancy and toddlerhood. We have not been able to do so, as the camera has been out of commission or in the repair shop for most of the time we've owned it.In September of 2003, after approximately 15 total hours of normal use, significant digital noise / pixel distortion and a "head cleaning required" message began to appear. We followed the prescribed procedure and cleaned the video heads with a MiniDV cleaning tape. The problem was not corrected, so we sought repair of the camcorder (to the tune of $240). A rebuild of the drum assembly, supply and takeup reels was performed by a JVC-authorized repair center.Since then, we have recorded less than two hours of tape, and the digital noise problem has again reappeared. Some research suggests that we are not the only ones who have had this difficulty with our JVC camcorder. Since my difficulties, I have found hundreds of consumer comments that suggest that this and several other models of JVC digital camcorders and DV recorders are riddled with digital noise problems.I have never been so dissatisfied with such a major purchase and am currently seeking a full refund from JVC. Wish me luck.
I agree with most reviewers that From Russia With Love is one of the best Bond movies but I was very disapointed that contrary to the cover claiming that it was a widescreen version it was full screen. I have the Criterion laserdisc which is widescreen and although the laserdisc is supposedly lower in resolution than the DVD I believe the laser is better. The extras with the DVD are nice but the screen format was a BIG disappointment! This refers to the 007 Volume 3 DVD which I assume is the same as the one listed here.
Hip-Hop producer/vet proves to still be in the game with this top-notch, long awaited, anticipated sequel to his impressive solo debut &quot;Soul Survivor.&quot; This time around, Pete lays his rhyming skills aside to focus more strictly on his production.Several of the guest performers on the album are sub-mainstream artists, speakably Talib Kweli, Pharoah Monch, Slum Village etc., who each give avid efforts to shock and amaze. Some tracks which feature the less known artists are plain out amazing, such as the ones featuring Leela James, Krumbsnatcha, and Little Brother. For they present Pete at some of his best production to date.One noticeable aspect that fans may witness is the abscense of Pete's DJ and mixing skills. There are absolutely none found throughout the album (a huge aspect which made Soul Survior 1 so memorable) so some Pete Rock fans (many of whom have grown fond of his mixing since the days of &quot;Mecca &amp; The Soul Brother&quot;) may find it as a shock to know that there are none in SS2.Lyrically, the album is impressive (you'd expect nothing less involving the Soul Brother #1) with some dope rhymes. The only tracks that I really wasn't feelin' were the ones with Postaboy, Dead Prez, and Jay Dilla. The tracks featuring Postaboy &amp; Dead Prez just sound too commercial for their own good, and lyrically aren't very impressive. As for the track with Jay Dilla (Jay Dee) he makes as a great producer, but a not-so-great MC (check out his &quot;Welcome To Detroit&quot; lp to get a better understanding) the track is also fairly short, clocking in at around two minutes. The track just felt rushed.All in all Soul Survior II (while productive-wise, not Pete's best work) is a decent follow-up to SSI and also a breath of fresh air aside from the mainstream hip-hop music scene. Four Stars.
Didn't use it due to late shipment. Seemed to be an ok product though. Would recommend higher if received sooner
This film actually put me to sleep. I watched the "Road to Passchendaele" feature on the DVD and it seemed to go on forever. One thing is quite clear and that is Paul Gross seems very fond of himself and his abilities. The film is heavy-handed and slow. It alternates between battle scenes and scenes on the homefront. I never believed the far-fetched romance with the Canadian nurse nor her brother with asthma who manages to enlist and winds up being looked after by Gross's character of Sergeant Mann, ala Saving Private Ryan. Yes, the battle scenes are gruesome and well filmed. It is just that the rest of the film is not on a par with the action scenes. I much more enjoyed The Red Baron and Flyboys. Perhaps maybe if Paul Gross had not tried to dominate every possible part of this film the results might have been better. The actual events on which this film is based were very significant and the Canadian forces made a great sacrifice and contribution. It is just a pity that this was not more obvious than Mr. Gross trying to carry the film solely by himself. He should at least have left the writing of the screenplay to someone more capable and objective. Then he would have been left with only top-star billing, directing and executive producing. Has anyone outside of Canada ever heard of Paul Gross before or since this film was made anyway??
You wouldn't think a book about a nuclear excursion could be witty and snappy, yet scientific -- but this book is. It is also well-researched.I tore through this book in a couple of nights -- I could not put it down. The author was able to mix science with dramatic, true-crime style writing which made the pages fly by.I had never heard of this disaster, and I am surprised more people don't know about it. This book is worth the money, if only to educate yourself about how the government could run a reactor that is falling apart and is controlled by ONE control rod. Hellloooo??At the end of the book, the choice is yours about what to believe happened -- I liked it that the author left it up to the reader. Good, old-fashioned solid writing with a little bit of "flash" (no pun intended).
Yeah, some of it is okay. I'm a fan of both Punk AND Emo/Screamo. This is def a bait and switch though. You could tell Anti-Flag was thrown on there to gain street cred with the punk crowd. But anyone that actually listens to punk would shut this off before even getting to that far in the album. Jack's Mannequin is punk?I think they should have done two cd's. Emo Goes Acoustic and Punk Goes Acoustic. Put the stuff on the right CD so people don't grab it expecting something totally not what they are promoting.
As a blade geek, I've accumulated many different tools for sharpening and honing blades over the years.While I won't be getting rid of any, the addition of the WS3000 to my arsenal is noteworthy.I previously purchased their knife sharpener and the drill doctor, and being impressed with the design and construction of those tools, finally decided to give the WS3000 a try.The WS3000 proved to be very effective right out of the box. The first tool I applied was an old rusty chisel.First I cleaned up the rust, so as to not ruin a new abrasive pad, then I went to work on it with the WS3000.Prior to this experiment that old chisel had been kicked all over the shop and abused, but now it shines in a place of honor on the wall amongst the rest of my chisels.Then I used it to sharpen a full size axe, and it proved to be just as effective.Two items paid off for me.1. watch the dvd, and2. use the crepe block frequently to clean the pads.(the crepe block that comes with the WS3000 is pretty small, but there are many to choose from @ amazon in the 6, 8 and 12 inch sizes for cheap bucks [they're called "Abrasive Belt Cleaner" here @ Amazon])Customer Service:My unit had a minor flaw, and Brian @ WorkSharp customer service was way cool!!He had me fixed up in no time, no hassles, no problem.I'd like to see this machine at twice the size (WS9000 ?) but I'm very happy I made this investment.
Limp Bizkit is the band you hate to love. Basically, my thoughts on this CD is that it's at its best when Fred keeps himself restrained and sings decent lyrics, as in &quot;My Way&quot;, or &quot;The One&quot;, which is a great mellow track which follows the footsteps of &quot;Rearranged&quot;...The annoyance comes in when Fred proudly announces that he has used the word f$#k 46 times, mocks NIN lyrics,(Hot Dog), or repeats the name of his band (just about every song) in case you didn't know it. There are some truly grating raps in &quot;Full Nelson&quot; and &quot;Livin' it Up,&quot; and this is a recurring theme throughout, but &quot;Rollin'&quot; rides a guitar riff so powerful it overcomes the nonsense. I still give it four stars because the band consistently rocks like few others today. Significant Other, however, will in the end stand as the better album and a signpost of the times.
i love ms. monroe's books!! her books are written w/ such detail and excitement that i can never put them down or explain the plot to anyone else! there is always sooo much going on, you are drawn into the story every time. you have to read her books to know what i mean. ms. monroe keep it up! your books are rare treasures.
This shoe is great for any water activities or just for walking around the deck. The bottom is non-slip, but fully flexible, and the inner sock is comfortable and dries quickly. They stretch to fit snugly and won't fall off or be flopping on your feet.
I have been sharpening knives on flat stones by hand for many years. I just got a Spyderco Sharpmaker, and it's the best contraption I have ever used.The stones are good quality. Similar cheaper brands have lumps on otherwise perfect stones, making them almost useless. Both the coarse and fine stones leave a relatively fine edge considering how well they remove metal.The triangular shape of the stones makes them work very well for regular knives and serrated knives as well.It comes with an instruction book that tells you exactly what to do. If you follow the instructions, you will get a very sharp edge. The only skill involved is holding the blade up and down, and that isn't hard at all.The price looks high, but you get a total of 4 long stones (two fine, two medium) of good quality. It is well worth the price to be able to keep your knives sharp on your own instead of paying someone to do it, which adds up fast.I don't recommend sharpening systems that involve clamping a guide system to the blade because they tend to slip and/or scratch the blade, are annoying to use for quick touch-ups, and don't actually maintain a good angle along the whole blade due to the mechanics involved.
Good construction, easy play, lightweight for carrying around the house, but...The highest note is FLAT! I have a musical ear and would like to develop a love of music in my sons. But this toy just frustrates me. I love that the 4 keys together make a chord and not just noise. But why bother make a chord if one of the keys is out of tune?If you also have a musical ear you will just be annoyed when your child plays with this toy.
NO! Go spend your allowance money on a good game like Medal of Honor or Driver, rather than this "trilogy". Just in case you're curious, here's what the three games consist of:PART 1 - a poorly made third person shooter with bad graphicsPART 2 - a poorly made rail shooter where you follow the exact same path again-and-again (like an arcade lightgun game)PART 3 - a poorly made driving gameI literally played this trilogy for forty-five minutes (15 minutes each game), and I was already sick of it. If these games were movies, they would be the equivalent of poorly-made home flicks. Grade Z.
Koss Is a real classy organization! Not only have I just bought the best headphones I have ever heard they are right now fixing my porta pro headphones just for the price of shipping!This is my 4th set of Koss. the first were the earlier version of this and the second were an open air model that I eventually stepped on and broke..too bad.The next were my Porta Pro'sMy only complaint is that I have had a sore neck lately and these are kind of heavy so when i got them today my neck still hurts.
This book is written for a narrow audience, but if you're in that audience it is hilarious. The book is a technicaly a murder mystery, but is really a humor book. It is a hilarious satire of church musicians and the goings on in a church (the personalities, the politics etc). If you are not an active church member &/or musician you won't get the jokes, but if you are, the book is absolutely hilarious. I had so many laugh out loud moments my husband thought I was going crazy. Highly recommended to the correct audience! A word of caution, I never found the book to be disrespectful of my Christian beliefs, but someone more conservative might find the irreverent sense of humor offensive.
An inspirational classic with for the most part simple, tasty recipes imbibed with the essence & tradition of French cooking. Whatever other favorite cookbooks you have it's a relief to dip into this small volume to charge the cooking batteries & be amazed at old traditional yet fresh & superb ways of dealing with simple favorites like eggs, pork, soups salads etc, it's about the essence of food & taste & not just a string of recipes, Alice Waters called it her inspiration for Chez Panisse & cooked from it for 20 years, Nuff said. If you love to cook get it immediately why waste time being without it? & it's inexpensive in paperback.
This movie is one of the best horror movies of the decade! Teens aren't really scary, right? Well, this movie makes them really scary! The scariest thing about this movie is that teens like the ones in the movie really exist! If you like truly shocking movies, you'll love this movie! Many people complain because it's too shocking, but it's a HORROR movie! Some people told me that they didn't like it because it bothered them, but that's what horror movies should do! If a horror movie manages to shock you deeply, then it's a masterpiece! I used to think that the horror genre was getting weaker and weaker, but movies like this one, Martys and others proved me wrong.Buy it!
Did some research on preshave products because my face was becoming irritated after shaving (it has always been sensitive and because of that I only shave 2-3 times per week).Supposedly Jojoba oil is an excellent product for skin care and I decided to give it a try.I applied to my face after showering and before applying shaving cream (I always shave after showering and with Edge Sensitive Skin shaving gel and my Gillette Fusion razor). This time the razor just glided over my skin and did not tug on the hair. I would estimate that the irritation was reduced by about 60-70%.The last few nights, I washed my face and applied the oil before bed. My skin has already become noticeably smoother and the product has not caused me to breakout...actually it may have helped clear up a few very small pimples.I like that this product is organic and there is no reason to purchase the non-organic oil because there is only about a $0.41/oz difference.Another reviewer commented on the cap which has a sort of rubber/silicone valve. It is hard to get a drop or two out because you need to squeeze with a reasonable amount of force and almost always end up with about 5-10 drops worth of oil on your hand. You could try and remove the rubber/silicone, but I would imagine the opening would be too large and way too much oil would come out since this is about the consistency of lightly warmed cooking oil.Overall, this is a good product and I can recommend it to anyone looking for a preshave or general skin care product (also try Vitamin E oil for general skin care...I use Nature's Bounty & Burt's Bees brand).
This lock is actually 1 15/16" wide not 1 5/16". So the title description isn't accurate. This is why I removed 1 star. However the good news is it should still fit my application as a lock for a gym locker. What I like is the curved bolt actually recedes into the body with the key turn. Not like the square-shrouded Master Lock which swings like a gate. So this lock should work very nice at my fitness club as the lockers there are unusual in that the hasp is on a 45 degree angle and there isn't much room for a big lock.
I was so eager to get this book that I ordered it from Amazon.co.uk, since it came out there a few months in advance of the American release (also the cover art is nicer on my edition). I have been hoping for a new FitzChivalry book, and this lives up to my hopes and more.This is a marvelous new journey with FitzChivalry Farseer and his wolf Nighteyes! The book takes place 15 years after Assassin's Quest, and begins at Fitz's (now known as Tom Badgerlock) cabin, which he shares with his adopted son, Hap. One by one, the people he loved best from his former life come to him, asking him to return to Buckkeep. First Chade, then Starling, and finally the Fool (YAY!) come to him, seeking to involve him once more in the politics of the Six Duchies. None of them are successful until Prince Dutiful disappears, and Fitz is called up to find him.Knowing he can't return as FitzChivalry (since he was executed for having the Wit), he takes service to Lord Golden, who is none other than the beloved Fool. When the hunt leads them from Buckkeep to a small holding of minor nobility, things begin to get dangerous. There are new factions rising in the Six Duchies, and whether they intend good or ill for the prince, they can certainly cause chaos with the knowledge they possess. Fitz and the Fool must rescue Dutiful, even if it means sacrificing their own lives, or the lives of those they love best.This book is a wonderful return to Fitz; Hobb has obviously kept in touch with him during the time she spent writing the Liveship Trilogy, because her characterization of him is as true as ever. He has gained a certain amount of wisdom, but he is still quite capable of foolishness and bullheaded blindness. The Fool is as mysterious as ever, though he certainly speaks with more frankness than he used to. With his new identity as Lord Golden, we (and Fitz) see a different side of him that adds even more dimensions to his character. The new characters of Lauren and Dutiful are strong additions to the cast, which is great since we'll at least be seeing more of Dutiful in the books to come.Once again Hobb has given us a magical and breathtaking story. I am VERY grateful that she returned to Fitz and the Fool (the Fool being one of my favourite characters of all fantasy!) and has given us more excitement. I have to admit, I spent the last bit of the book in tears - but Hobb has always had that effect on me!
The Three Stooges are probably the most under-appreciated comic actors in history. They were multi-talented with remarkable timing and adlibbing skills. Most of their films were much better than those of their contemporaries in the two-reeler market - indeed, there are many which supersede the great Laurel and Hardy in laugh content. They were very well written; expertly edited. In addition, the supporting players were well utilized. Unfortunately, "Corny Casanovas" contains the kind of stuff than even Stooge devotees cringe at: some of the most gruesome and gratuitous violence ever captured on film, which degrades the remainder in this package.In this 1952 film Larry and Moe manage to knock each other out, using devices such as chimney bellows and shovels. Moe whacks Larry on the side of the head, leaving him unconscious. But that's not enough - he places the bellows in Larry's mouth and pumps soot into his gut which momentarily distends like a balloon. Larry wakes up in a rage and smashes Moe over the head repeatedly until he too hits the floor. Another horrible gag involves Moe swallowing tacks - he is saved from choking when Larry shoves a magnet down his throat! It's unbelievable.The purpose of the long scene, apparently, is to set-up the gleefull departure of the flim-flaming golddigger who has fooled all three (not too daunting a task!), and left with jewelry.In their best films, the poking and punching was included as a kind of personality quirk of the easily riled Moe, and nobody really got hurt. In fact, the real humour came from the viewer's belief that Curly actually had some kind of other-worldly ability to take any kind of punishment and would show pain out of loyalty to his mentor!"A Missed Fortune" has a fairly predictable plotline about winning a large sum of money and going out on the town. In the boys' excitement they rent a huge room in a luxurious hotel managed by who else? - Vernon Dent. Their only oversight is that the money hasn't arrived yet. Naturally, they wreck the place. There is some good dialogue, but the only decent scene involves the arrival of three ladies with dollar signs in their eyes, who meet with a bucket of water. The physical humour is not as rough as in "Corny Casanovas"."He Cooked His Goose" is by far the best of the three, as it gives the under-rated Larry Fine a chance to essentially dominate a film! Instead of playing the "neutral" Stooge, he's a fast-talking (and highly UNsympathetic)entrepreneur who exploits Shemp and Moe in his plot to win their women. Moe steps back and just reacts this time, an interesting departure.This collection is strictly *collectors only*.
Once again, it's a phone call and a voice from the past that gets Dr. Alex Delaware involved in murder and mayhem. Rand Duchay had been an illiterate 13 year old when he helped to kill a little girl eight years ago and Delaware had been called upon to evaluate him (and the other 13 year old murderer, Troy Turner, who didn't survive his incarceration). Anyway, Rand is a 21 year old man now, and has just been released. He calls from a payphone and says he wants to talk about the murder. Alex agrees to meet him, but Rand never shows. Eventually, homicide detective Milo Sturgis is able to explain why the troubled young man never showed - he was busy being murdered. Milo tells Alex to forget about it, but we know Alex, don't we? He wants to know why Duchay called him, starts tossing around theories and sucks Milo into an investigation that begins to unearth some very nasty creatures.More relationship troubles for Alex and this time he is completely blameless. He may have given Robin reason to leave (even though she refuses to actually leave), but Allison's problem is all hers! Not sure where that relationship is going to end up. It's a shame, because I liked Allison - you know, before she went all freaky. Poor Spike - the cute pooch? - is not doing well. Seems old age is creeping up on him.There's a scene at the climax that is ... well, pretty gross. Like Alex, I'm pretty good at conjuring mental images too and these descriptions were pretty vivid. Just a warning to the faint-hearted.
Just put ours up yesterday, it seems very small but it is in fact 18" long. We have a spatula, measuring cups/measuring spoons, a wire balloon wisk, a masher, spatula and a large spoon on ours above the sink. It's great for often-used tools & saves time searching in crowded drawers. I really want to get another & possibly cut it down a bit as we have very little hanging space. Just note that this can only go on a wall, it won't work mounted under. Hubby says it looks clean & modern.

being a romance reader for a number of years, i have to admit i've never read a novel by jacquie d'alessandro until now. now that i have, i wonder what took me so long to find such a gifted author.NOT QUITE A GENTLEMAN is one of those romance novels that sneaks up on you and before you know it, you're emersed in a story of passion and intimacy. why does it sneak up on you? because the premise is overused and more times than not, means witnessing a heroine's petty attempts at exacting revenge against the hero who used her. not so the case in this instance.lady victoria wexhall is a young woman on a mission. three years prior to the beginning of the story, she shared a passionate and mind-blowing kiss with dr. nathan oliver. she anticipated he would court her after the interlude but he instead disappeared from her life and left her embittered. now her father has sent her to dr. oliver's estate in cornwall so that she can contemplate her future plans, which includes two offers for marriage. she sees this as the perfect opportunity to get her revenge and with the aid of the scandalous book "A Lady's Guide to Personal Happiness and Intimate Fulfillment" has devised a plan to kiss and leave dr. oliver just as he left her three years ago.dr. nathan oliver is a retired spy who is now a physician living in a small cottage with a menagerie of farm animals. his reputation was ruined as a result of a botched plan to steal jewels for the crown. he is thought to have betrayed the mission, which resulted in his brother and best friend being shot. while both of them lived, the hurt at their lack of faith in him and his guilt over his part in their injury forced him to leave his family for three years until he is summoned back to the family estate by victoria's father who says he has a note hidden in victoria's luggage that will help him to clear his name.initially i thought this would be a story full of misunderstandings because nathan is an ex-spy and victoria is a somewhat jilted woman who i thought would harbor nothing but ill-will and suspicion towards nathan, only enhanced by his secretive behavior. imagine my surprise and relief as d'alessandro skipped over those trite plot devices and instead had nathan be honest with victoria from the very beginning. also, victoria could have been a bitter, petty heroine. instead she turned out to be anything but.d'alessandro did an amazing job of creating two characters who were both intelligent, passionate, and honest with their feelings with each other while also creating the kind of sexual tension that left me breathless. as victoria and nathan embark on trying to locate the stolen jewels, the reader is able to witness them fall in love as they spend time together learning about each other and finding out all of the things they have in common, despite the fact that she's a london chit and he's a country doctor.this is a beautiful love story. nathan is sensual, loving, and honest with his feelings about victoria, even while he was afraid of the depth of those emotions. victoria, despite her plan for revenge (which was discarded pretty early in the story), is the perfect match for nathan in that she is also intelligent, courageous, sensual, and honest with her needs and desires. what a refreshing change when so many authors think an innocent heroine means she must also be stupid and afraid of her sexual needs.the intimate scenes weren't graphic. in fact, while they were VERY passionate, there was more description of the emotions going on during those moments than there was of what the hero and heroine were actually doing (although the author gives us that, too). d'alessandro does a phenomenal job of depicting the passion and yearning the hero and heroine feel for each other and there is romantic gesture at the very end that had me shaking my head at the beauty of it. let me just say that nathan is a memorable hero. there are a number of romantic moments throughout the book that had me falling in love with nathan, too!as for the plot about the jewels, it's little more than a plot device to get the hero and heroine together for long periods of time throughout the book, so if you're looking for a marsha canham type of adventure, this ain't that kind of story. it centers almost solely around nathan and victoria's interactions with each other, which allows the reader to view intimately the characterization and chemistry between the hero and heroine.ultimately, it's like this: this is a historical where the hero and heroine are unafraid of intimacy and vulnerability, the uncontrollable yearning for intimacy is felt equally on both ends, the story itself focuses more on the growth of their relationship, and the intimate scenes are strong on emotional detail and lighter on graphical detail, and it's all done VERY WELL.if you like those things, you'll love this story. i HIGHLY recommend it.
YES!YES!YES! to every other review! it is perfect, beautiful art.When it first came out (the LP), it came with a sticker on the cover..."The Best Bossa Nova Album Ever"...it still is. When invited to dinner, instead of the bottle of wine as a gift, I brought this. Much Better Than a Bottle of Wine.
Kinley/Sherrilyn, can't get enough of her books and this was not exception. I read it in a day because I couldn't put it down, lucky for the family it was pizza night!!!
Elvis achieves several classic performances in this video; highlights include &quot;An American Trilogy&quot; and &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; as well as informal gospel warmups and warmdowns such as &quot;I John&quot; and &quot;Lead Me, Guide Me.&quot; But this tape should not be available to the public in its present form.In spite of Elvis's greatness, the film is horrifyingly bad. The camera work and editing are amateurish at best, with several outrageous mistakes--most notably Elvis playing his guitar left-handedly because of accidental image mirroring. The sound may be the worst of any concert video ever legally released, with the sound coming in and going out as though the tape had been left in the sun, the piano completely indiscernable throughout the entire concert, and several of the other instruments frequently likewise indiscernable because of the extreme tape hiss. Finally, any sense of coherent direction is nonextistent, with irrelevant pseudo-documentary moments interrupting Elvis's performances.BMG has taken over Colonel Tom Parker's job of insulting both the art of Elvis and the sensibilities of Elvis's fans. And this video may be the biggest insult yet. This video needs the same treatment as &quot;That's the Way It Is&quot; received; until that treatment comes, I will refuse to watch this video.
This is by far the best book I have read which deals with Southern culture. This book is very funny. At first it was hard keeping all of the characters straight but after awhile it becomes easy and you really get to know them. I am sure for those who have read this book that they thought of certain individuals in their families which reminded them of the characters in the book. There are also just enough twists and turns to keep you interested. However, like someone previously stated, this is the most entertaining book in which absolutely nothing happens. Welty utilizes a sort of Hemmingway-esque dialogue with just enough of a Southern twist to make the characters come to life in a sort of familial (inbred) manner.
.When you read the Preface of this book, the author tells us he was inspired to write it, following a comment made by a Hollywood starlet in a movie magazine. This sets the tone for the rest of the book. Pure flim flam.The Bodanis approach includes giving us salacious details on the love life of Voltaire's mistress. His dumbing down of basic chemistry includes a description of Lavoisier's oxidation experiments as &quot;some of the gases must have flown down and stuck to the metal&quot;.With the speed of light as the critical element to his story he persists throughout the book in giving its speed in miles per hour (670 million). To impress us he squares it and gives us all the zeroes. Wouldn't he be doing everybody a favour if he introduced scientific notation and even occasionally referred to the International System for units of measurement? After all, those French guys 220 years ago did come up with metres and kilograms, without which modern science would be impossible. Those relationships between mass, time and energy (which is what this book is meant to be all about) are unlikely to have been realized without the introduction of the metric system.His description of radioactivity is almost comic when we have radiation &quot;squirting out&quot; of Marie Curie's uranium ores. We are told poor Marie's fate was sealed when &quot;radioactive dust slams into the DNA of her bones&quot;. We are given no mention of her inhaling all the radon gas emanating from that radium she so famously discovered. It is the effects of this radon that is now generally acknowledged as the most probable cause of her death.In many places in the book he confuses nuclear fission and fusion, at one point drawing similarities between the processes at work in a star and what makes a uranium bomb work. For example, he writes &quot;our sun explodes the equivalent of many millions of such bombs every second&quot;The most fundamental fallacy in the book is the way Bodanis links directly Einstein's equation of 1905 and the unleashing of man-made nuclear energy in the early 1940's. The Special Theory of Relativity of which the famous equation is central had nothing to do with the development of the A-Bomb. The essence of Einstein's argument (and equation) is that energy has inertia, and inertia has energy. There was no reference in his work as to how the energy may be released; yet Bodanis persists in referring to &quot;the full power of Einstein's equation&quot; when he talks about the events of 1905.Glaring contradictions are found throughout the book. On page 169 Bodanis writes &quot; when that great mushroom cloud appeared E=mc^2's first work on planet Earth was done&quot;. A chapter or so later when talking about natural process at work within the earth he gives us &quot; Volcanoes exploded upward - powered by the constant E=mc^2 derived heat beneath&quot;.The sad irony of this book is seeing a significant topic dealt with in such a lightweight manner. Worthwhile (and readable) science books for general audiences do exist. The superficial, error-ridden and vacuous crassitude of this book is most disappointing.
Claudio Arrau's Sonatas set is one for the ages. It is thoughtful, musically honest and inspired like no one else's. True, it took me some time to realize this. But I've come to like Arrau's interpretations, more than any other pianist's. I don't think it would right to talk about 'the best' Beethoven cycle, as there isn't just one perfect way to the top, but so far I consider Arrau's performances deeper and more satisfying than anyone else's. He is unmatched in revealing the essence of the sonatas, and no one can hold a candle to Arrau's injections of drama in fairly every piece. It is indeed as if you're living through the sonatas yourself, as one other reviewer said.Arrau takes a very serious, almost dark and tragic, approach to the sonatas. He may miss some of the music's humor because of that, but on the whole the effect is very rewarding. On paper it may seem that Beethoven's earlier works do not profit from Arrau's approach, but it's not true in reality. He performs these pieces as if they are just as important as the later works, and hearing him I can only prove him right. I've not yet heard anyone who makes these sometimes ignored pieces so interesting and powerful. The serious weight he gives to the very first sonata is amazing, especially in the last movement. The op.7 sonata is much more than just a pretty dancing piece. And even in the normally sunny second sonata, its dark sides are most significant in Arrau's performance. The fifth sonata is played quite slowly but with so much content and attention to every moment that it is just breathtaking. Overall, Arrau's bold and thoughtful playing reveals a great amount of hidden treasures in these sonatas and lets every phrase sing with great beauty.Beethoven's middle-period works like the Moonlight, Tempest, Waldstein and Appassionata are in equally superb hands, especially in the Appassionata whose outer movements are greatly intimidating and violent. No one quite captures the torrent towards the end in the Appassionata's final as powerfully as Arrau does here, although Pollini's live recording comes close. Arrau's Waldstein is notable for its unusually slow first movement that yet remains fascinating all the way through. His Moonlight made me listen again to this piece that I got bored of a little. I don't think the Moonlight's last movement is weak, as others say. Maybe it doesn't live up to the extreme standards of the rest of the set, but even then it is among the better renditions. Again, the more humorous pieces of this period are less swift and surprising than in other's renditions. The final of the op.31/3 'Hunt' sonata gives no single reason to laugh. But Arrau fills the gap with so much furious power and intensity that I strongly doubt which approach to prefer. The final of Les Adieux is heaven-storming instead of the usual children's party treatment, and you may understand what I prefer.And even after then, the highlight of the set hasn't been reached: the late sonatas get that honour. Arrau's arresting performance of op.101 is a hint of what's coming after: the Hammerklavier. This sonata has of course received many legendary performances (my own favourites are Solomon, Gilels, Pollini, Rosen, Brendel, Serkin, Gould and Kempff) but Arrau does better than any of them. Listen how carefuly he prepares the opening bars, for instance, and then dives headstrong into the movement. The Adagio Sostenuto gets the most somber rendition I've heard, and the fugue is a model of precise articulation combined with effortless and even technique.The last three sonatas then, all sound completely different from other recordings. Arrau gives a highly personal performance of the theme and variations of op.109, rather mannered and all but still convincing in its own way. The last variation is one of the greatest moments of all Beethoven, and likewise it is one of the most memorable performances of Arrau. The op.110 sonata is on a similar scale, with the fugue played in total devotion and concentration. There may be some doubts over the rather slow first movement of op.111, but Arrau leaves every bit of drama intact--in fact, I find that the slower tempo even adds to the intensity. The Arietta, too, is on the slow side, but it makes full sense, although I'd prefer a more rhytmical 3rd variation. Yet what follows is as heavenly and moving as any performance of this piece could become (notice the short stop he makes in between the leggieramente figures around 11.00; just brilliant!), not to mention the incredible trills near the end.Again, the set may not seem as good at first. Arrau misses most of Beethoven's humor, and his playing is a little slow and careful at times. But that's just the surface. Beneath, there is an immense amount of fantastic insights waiting. Arrau's early sonatas sound like they have got a repainting, and a superb one at that. The middle-period pieces get an intensely tragic and dark treatment, and the late sonatas are played quite originally and among the most profound and spirited recordings ever made. I doubted first, but now I simply love this set more than fairly any other recording I have. Regarding the comments of other reviewers here, I doubt if many will disagree. There are other ways to play Beethoven--Brendel and especially Kempff are more lucid, Schnabel generates more excitement, etcetera. But this is a Beethoven sonata set for the ages, a great investment if there ever was one.
I love this movie and it's pretty funny. My most favorite part of the movie is when Neve Campbell gets fed up with her hard job so she takes off her clothes and runs in the cafeteria butt naked in front of over 75 people and complains about her hard boring job and saying her credit card bill is too high and it's very funny when she says this restaurant is a rat infested piece of shit place and it's funny when some guy whistles at her naked body. She has a nice body and I love seeing her naked and seeing her boobies. I love this movie and it's makes me laugh so hard especially seeing the part where she gets naked and by the way her boobs look I think they're natural. It's funny seeing Neve Campbell naked. I'd so love to have seen her naked in the scream movies. She was so hot on the first scream.
Happily went back to my OEM shift knob after this. Doubt I'll ever think of changing it again. It changed the throw of the shift. I like stock from now on.
This book was excellent; I literally laughed out loud repeatedly. What a treat. If you want some fun, enjoyable reading, read this one.
No talking in circles, just good, to the point information and Biblical references. JM inspirational books are the best! The book was in perfect shape. Got one for each of my boys. Wish I had gotten me one. Will order one eventually.
The Good Earth is such a beautifully told universal story. The rising of Wang Lung begets the falling of his family. It also reminds us that behind every successful man is a powerful woman.
el mejor de todos los cd despues mas y alma al aire,el tiene 3 en italiano y 3 en portuguez tambienles recomiendo esos que bueno es escuchar la musica en otroidioma y suena bonito, espero que les sirva de algo yo tambien soy fan de el y me identifico con su musica.soy de venezuela y es uno de los mejores de espa&ntilde;a. a comprarlo.
This works really well with the psp and you don't need the adapter. It holds all of my memory. If you have a psp you should buy this 8 gbs pro duo card. You'll need the space.
Designed an oak cabinet to house our tv stuff, receiver,DVD, wii, etc, wantedit to match an old oak wardrobe that I had in our family room with the tv. The wardrobe had a neat bead detail, so I bought this bit matched perfectly, so now both pieces have the same bead. Very pleased. Very sharp, went right thru the oak, smooth finish.
I really like this DVD player. Used it to replace an older and much more expensive Toshiba. It plays DVD-R discs flawlessly. The menu system is perhaps a bit complex if you go into advanced set up, but everything else is simple, and the images are clean. You will need an optical cable if you want digital sound, since it doesn't provide an RCA digital out. You might want to pick up an optical cable with your order. Also, consider the F65S. It has a wider body and might not fit all areas, but it is like this unit but supports 5 discs.
Looking at this book online it sounded very interesting, but I bought the audio tape and was VERY disappointed. OK, we ADDer's may get impatient with too much detail, but this work didn't have ENOUGH! The authors give basic outline advice, but they don't go much further. In addition, the advice they do give is sometimes rather obvious. I am just beginning learning about adult ADHD, and this book didn't near satisfy my craving for insight and information. It seems once I reach a subject I'm interested in, the authors dump it and move on to another! A fair starting point I guess, but if you want to go deeper, this book doesn't do it.
That's the essential point being made with this movie. It's a "grrl power" themed message that females can be werewolves too. Who'd have thought women would ever shatter THAT glass ceiling. Somebody's not minding the constant "patriarchal oppression" of women in society if we're allowing them to turn into fictional raging blood thirsty beasts from hell.Or was this meant as a metaphor for what feminism has turned women into?I'll add, Katharine Isabelle (Ginger) is a very good actress, she stole the movie.
David Godman's Be As You Are is an outstanding, well-organized introduction to the spiritual teachings of Sri Ramana Maharshi (1879-1950), India's greatest twentieth-century guru. If you find that Maharshi's teachings (which focus on realizing Who, or What, you truly are) resonate with you, then continue your study of his Dharma with Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi, Sri Ramana Gita, and Sat-Darshana Bhashya and Talks with Maharshi. These books and many other fine ones pertaining to Ramana Maharshi are available at [...].I am an expert in Eastern spirituality, having devoted the past forty years of my life to studying, practicing, and teaching it; and I say that if there is one guru every serious spiritual seeker must read, it is Ramana Maharshi. And Be As You Are is a great first book to begin your reading with.
I owned McAfee (Office Pro 2000 and Version 6) programs in the past. Office Pro 2000 really [messed] up my Windows OS a big time every time I updated the program (DAT files and engine). I had to de-install McAfee programs and re-install Windows OS every time it happened (that was the only way I can get my computer to run back to normal). Both Office 2000 and Version 6 takes forever to update from the website. You could say I don't like them anymore. Not worth the headache!So, I tried out PC-Cillin 2000 a couple of months ago based on good reviews from other owners. After using it so far up to now, I noticed it runs a lot better than McAfee anti-virus program because this program detected virus in my mail and computer three times so far (within two months!) and it deleted them for me. McAfee program never once detect a virus for me when I had it for few years, not one! I detected a couple in the past by myself and deleted them manually. What's more, this PC-Cillin 2000 will update the program automatically for me every time the company updated the virus info. (of course, it will ask me if I want it to update it for me or not). That's great! The downloading didn't take very long, maybe a couple of minutes or so comparing to McAfee taking forever.Lastly, I had a minor trouble with this program with my Netscape browser after I finished with my installation. The technical support was able to give me some troubleshooting help right away (in a day ot two) in timely fashion (thru e-mails) and gave me solutions to fix the problem including a patch thru downloadable attachment (upgrading the version so the program will be compatiable with my browser). This fixed the problem and everything ran smoothly. The technical support did a great job helping the customer like me. I was pleased with it.A note: I know it bothers some people when a small PC-Cillin window shows up on your screen for a couple of seconds or so every time the program is used to detect the virus like getting new messages, etc. It doesn't bother me because I'm getting used to it. This becomes nothing compared to what's important to you (having virus detected). Right? I like this program so far and it has been helpful to me on several occasions better than other programs I had in the past. Some major stores didn't have this program on their shelves and it should have been. I wonder why? I'm glad I found it here. Thanks Amazon.com!
"Il Trovatore" fait partie avec "Carmen" de ces op&eacute;ras que tout le monde aime et une publication de la version en franais ne pouvait qu'tre atendue par certains. Malheureusement, il s'agit d'un enregistrement du festival de Martina Franca r&eacute;alis&eacute; par le label Dynamic. On ne sait jamais trop, avec les organisateurs de ce festival, jusqu'&agrave; quel point les f&eacute;liciter et &agrave; partir de quand leur donner de copieuses paires de claques. Et l&agrave;, nous avons les mmes d&eacute;fauts que d'habitude qui feront que cet enregistrement ne d&eacute;passera pas le stade de curiosit&eacute;. Premi&egrave;re chose quand on reprend une oeuvre en franais alors que les enregistrements en italien sont pl&eacute;thore, on prend des chanteurs franais. L&agrave;, nous n'avons que Sylvie Brunet pour le rle d'Azucena. Le reste ? La pt&eacute;e habituelle bien connue dont nous r&eacute;galent de nombreux chanteurs pour qui les langues ne sont qu'un d&eacute;tail. Ceci est aussi valable pour le choeur, des Slovaques &agrave; qui on a envie de payer urgemment des cours &agrave; l'Alliance franaise. Quant &agrave; l'orchestre, plat et ennuyeux, il ne s'en sort pas mieux. Les vingt minutes de ballet, qui sont le grand int&eacute;rt de la version franaise par rapport &agrave; l'italienne, sont de ce point de vue-l&agrave; insupportables. Je ne parle pas non plus de la prise de son, &eacute;touff&eacute;e avec de nombreux bruits de sc&egrave;ne ou d'orchestre, bien clairs eux. Bref, le seul m&eacute;rite de ce disque est qu'il existe et que l'on peut se faire une petite id&eacute;e de cette version. Par contre le prix du neuf demand&eacute; par le label Dynamic n'est pas vraiment raisonnable.
...I know I'm in the minority here but I didn't enjoy this book at all. Half way through it I was angry. My husband asked me what was wrong. When I told him I felt like I was in school studying a Shakespeare book rather than reading a romance novel he begged me to stop reading it and read Johanna Lindsey, Connie Mason, Judith McNaught... ANYTHING! The only reason I finished it was because I kept going back and reading the reviews and asking myself, why? Well, I guess that's what's so great about us all, we all have our own taste.
The title says it all and it wasn't worth the hassle to pursue another soultion. I chalked this one up as a loss and you should too.
I teach a 4th thru 6th grade Sunday school class and when I found this book and began brousing through it, God put on my heart to read single accounts each week from it to my class. I have been giving it as a reward to the diligent kid's that bring their Bibles and memorize their weekly scriptures. I only give away (2) copies every other week because I want them to work for this book and to appreciate what they hear from it each week. Also,I can't afford to buy more than (4) copies each month. I know that kid's will read this and that God will use it to create a hunger for more of His Word in them just as Foxe's book of Martyrs did for me when I was younger. Parent, Teachers or anyone: Give this book away and read it yourself.
When I first heard Dark Side of the Moon, it sounded like the most creative, inspired, fresh piece of music I had ever heard.What makes this observation amazing is that I did not encounter the album until the mid 1990s, some 20 years after its original release.The durability and timelessness of this album is a testament to its awesome power and beauty. Listen to any other piece of music from the early 70s and then listen to this album; there is absolutely no comparison. With the exception of one or two brief moments, none of the sounds on this CD are in any way dated or tired. I have no doubt that DSOTM will be attracting new young listeners in another 30 years as well.If you are put off of DSOTM by some of the Floyd's other, lesser works, don't be. Their other albums range from unlistenably awful to very good, but none of them before or since can touch DSOTM.
There's so much I can say about this album, but I don't think I will. Just go out and buy it - it is awesome. The Rx Bandits drive through 15 songs of pure musical brilliance and energy. Everytime I listen to this album, I am filled with extreme joy. Every song is awesome in its own, and not only that, but they are so easy to sing along with that soon you'll have the whole album stuck in your head. Which brings me to another thing - this album is really just one big song. Every song leads perfectly into the next, with barely any silence at all, and then ends as it begins. A brilliant full circle. All in all, BUY IT!
This is an outstanding production with Carlos Kleiber's direction providing an important part of the overall excellence. The other reviewers have dealt with this but I just need to add that the female leads, Rosalinde(Pamela Coburn) and Adele (Janet Perry) are superb both vocally and in their comic acting. The only problem I have is that the VHS tape is recorded at a very high level and some distortion results. Hopefully, this is remedied in the DVD version. I am prompted to write this review to present an alternative way of looking at Act 3 which is the morning after a New Year's Eve Party. Frosch (Franz Muxeneder), the jailer, is a drunk and the beginning of Act 3 features his drunken monologue which I find the funniest part of the opera. Opinions obviously vary on this Act 3, but it is a traditional part of Fledermaus, and I think most viewers will find this excellent comedy, consistent with what has gone before. I complained about the sound on the VHS tape, but the DVD sound quality is quite good.
This season is a lot darker then the first it cut out some and adds a few it dose try to change the story line then it seems it is a rush to end it and/or find a ending. Personally I think they should of stopped with the first season but they did not and well this one dose not live up to the first season but it is still enjoyable and it dose have a ending with kinda twist.The Animation is Awesome (I like the style)The voice acting is nice and clearThe story is Very dark.This is a great Scf-fi Anime you do not catch everything everytime you watch it but it dose not get boring quick.If your a fan of Sci-fa/Action Anime and the first season,then this series is right up your ally. WARNING: Adult Themes, Violence, Some blood ect ect make this not for children but for the Adult anime lover.
I've read through alot of good reviews here. so mine will be short. I admire the movie for being truthful about war, how the soldiers show fear, (as in life) there aren't any cheap attempts at patriotism here either. no one liners. In a sense I felt I was watching a documentary of the events that took place in 1993.the movie showed our soldiers unbelievable bravery without sugarcoating the facts. I felt a lump in my throat when the two soldiers dropped down out of the helicopter to try and save their fallen brothers, against hundreds of enemy militia. I have never seen bravery displayed on cinema in any manner like the bravery shown in this movie.
from the pic, it looks as if it had a center screw to affix to the wall plate. but, in fact it does not and so when removing plugs the whole device comes away from the wall outlet. it has a sloppy fit and needs to have a screw to secure it to the wall plate,
...dime or minute will I waste on this author or his books. Okay, with Dies the Fire (the first book) I was equal parts entertained and annoyed. But the premise, all technology inexplicably ceasing to work, was intriguing enough to keep me going. Through the Gaelic and Wiccan sayings/rituals. Regardless of the annoying protagonists (Juniper and Astride). Despite the lack of any fleshing out of the main antagonist. And in spite of the overall mediocre writing. A great premise poorly executed, but still...a great premise.So now we come to the Protector's War, the sequel where I'd hoped the author had made some corrections in his execution of the story. Fortunately, from my experience with the first book, I knew better than to actually *buy* what ultimately turned out to be an utter waste of time. Unless you speak Gaelic or are a Wiccan or just enjoy being bored out of your mind, do not waste a minute of your time on this book. Never in my life have I wished more for the demise of a story's protagonists. There are other reviews here that put words to the awfulness of this book that I can't match. One star is too good for this book.If you haven't read Dies the Fire and are not dissuaded by the mixed reviews - read that one instead. If you love it, you'll probably enjoy Protector too. If your opinion of DtF is mixed, as was mine, treat Protector's War like it was it was a root canal operation - something you'd only do if you were forced to.
I just finished watching Das Boot. To even draw comparisons between these two movies is absolutely ridiculous. Where Das Boot is a gripping human tale of the tragedy of war, U-571 is just more Hollywood tripe.If you just want 'splosions and escapism, I guess U-571 does the trick.If you want a realistic sub movie that will haunt you for many nights to come, go with Das Boot.
Vanden Heuvel is to the left what Rush Limbaugh is to the right. Objectivity be damned!However, the authors state their positions passionately and persuasively. Like one of the reviewers stated previously, if you have a conservative bent, the articles will make you really think about your position. If, on the other hand, you are more liberally inclined, these articles won't say anything that you haven't already heard.
I am a yoga teacher and a mystic-scholar. I have been reading spiritual texts for more than forty years, and two of the first texts I read when I began studying the aphorisms of Patanjali were Raja Yoga, by Swami Vivekananda, and How to Know God, by Prabhavananda and Isherwood. Raja Yoga was supposed to be the finest advanced Patanjali text (it isn't), and How to Know God was supposed to be the best basic, or introductory, text (it was, and as far as I know, still is)--and so I don't recommend Vivekananda's book for advanced students of Raja Yoga, but I do recommend How to Know God for beginners, with the caveat that it is for neophytes, not for advanced students looking to really penetrate the deeper "mechanics" of the Self-realization process.I am familiar with the other advanced texts recommended in the reviews--even though I have not fully read or studied all of them--and none of them, in my opinion, are as deep or profound as Yoga Philosophy of Patanjali, by Samkhhya-yogacharya Swami Hariharananda Aranya. Raja Yoga culminates in Kaivalya (eradicating the dominant "Buddhi," or ego-I sense, and realizing the transcendental `I,' or Self, in the Heart-center (the Hridayam, distinct from the anahata heart chakra), where the samskaras, or psychical seed tendencies, are "fried"); and Kaivalya is preceded by Dharmamegha ("Cloud of Dharma") samadhi, whereby and wherein the yogi receives the Divine downpour (of Shakti, or Grace) from the Divine "Cloud Above." Prior to encountering Aranya's text, I was unfamiliar with Dharmamegha samadhi in Raja Yoga, but as a yogi who channels heavy-duty Shakti (or Spirit Power) into my Heart-center and regularly rests in deep Heart-felt samadhis, I knew, from my own experience and from what other yoga traditions (especially Kashmir Shaivism) say, that he was describing the Self-realization process on a level beyond that of the other Patanjali texts I had studied.So start your study of Patanjali's Sutras with How to Know God, and if you find that Patanjali floats your spiritual boat, then "graduate" to more advanced text, such as Aranya's.
The furminator is a great tool and works awesome on my husky. After a few minutes of brushing him the undercoat was coming out in clumps I almost couldn't keep up. It was the best brush I have used. My husky loved it and was rolling over on his back wanting me to brush his stomach. He even tried playing with it. Brushing sensitive areas was a breeze. Haven't had it too long so I'm sure I'll have more to say in a few weeks. I even recommended this to a friend who has a couple dogs and he and his wife love it. They say it's the best brush they every used and they've had dogs for many years and tried many brushes. They are very thankful to me for passing on the info. Thanks for a great product!!
I bought this CD on a whim; I thought its "Raga meets Enya" style might be appealing. And, gosh, was I right! Please ignore Amazon.com's over the top negative review of this album. I reacted similarly to the disk the first time I heard it. But this is one that really rewards repeated listening. Those familiar with filmi music might find that Sheetal's music bears some resemblance to that of A.R. Rahman.
The book is very comprehensive on setup and maintenance but skimped a little on the technical information of the fishes, and didn't cover the extreme ranges of species available. Perfect for the beginner, but a little less advanced for the person looking to expand the hobby. All the basics are there, the photos are beautiful!
This was one of the best novels I've read in a long time. Great story and is an easy read. I have Mary Lawson keeps writing. I can't wait for her next book to be released.
This stripper is nothing fancy but it does its job well. I used this on 14-gauge speaker wire when I was setting up my new surround sound system, and it worked great!
Like ALMOST everything I have purchased from this publisher, this is a competent and useful resource on the topic.
this camera replaced my Canon sd800. Canon had the worst video sound ever. It could not handle high volume sounds from concerts. It was very dissapointing. And the indoor shots produced too much noise.So now T50 arrives. What a beauty, both from outside and inside.takes very sharp pictures under most light conditions. Supersteady shot seems to be working better that Canon. High Iso mode has less noise than Canon SD800. The videos have perfect sound quality.The touch screen is so easy to use and classy.The battery life is outstanding together with the battery remaining indicator. Canons do not have this indicator for some reason.I would recommend this camera strongly to any P&S; fanatics. get the black one by the way ;)
I bought this album a couple months ago, and was totally looking forward to it showing up. ... When it finally showed up I took it to work and listened to it there. I was rather disappointed. I thought that maybe I just wasn't listening hard enough, or the computer speakers weren't doing it justice, so I popped it in when I got home. I was even more disappointed, and bored, not to mention [upset] off.Below the Lights is a boring album. The production also [is weak]. Whoever mixed it made the rhythm guitar way too loud, so that it overpowers the rest of the instruments, not to mention the vocals. This is not good, especially considering that the rhythm guitarist is not doing anything interesting, is extremely repetitive and annoying. In fact, I don't think he is really all that talented, so what gives?A lot of the album doesn't really make sense. There are a lot of weird noises thrown in here and there, which can be cool, but they don't really seem to fit in. Then there is one song (can't remember which one) that is more like two distinctly different songs, but there is no fade, no introduction, nothing linking the two halves, it just changes. Below the Lights is sloppy.I could go on, but I don't feel like wasting more of my time. I will say though, that the other band members (baring, of course the rhythm guitarist) are actually good musicians, they just put out a [weak] album and have discouraged me from checking out anything else of theirs.The album description above says this is their most "massive album so far." Yeah, well it seems to me that it was maybe a bit too massive for Enslaved to handle. Opeth does it way better (I can't believe that I am endorsing Opeth, but they are undeniably awesome musicians).
I think its surprising to see amateur DJ's in their review of this compilation criticizing the mixing skills of two masters who have been around for years. Mixing is a subjective thing, there are lots of ways to do it, and the only rule is that the beats match up. Personally I think the mixing is fine.I bought this cd because I have lots of cd's of artists that are more on the fringe of d'n'b and I wanted a mix of music that is broadly accepted as straight d'n'b, no qualms. That's exactly what I got, and its great. The cool thing too is that you get the hard-hitting dancefloor tracks on the Grooverider cd and the more evolved stuff on Fabio's. Both are fun to listen too, and there are big hits on both cd's. I only skip a few tracks on each cd. Some of my big fav's are "Give me your love" and "chinese silk" on Fabio, and "Time Crisis" and "Lockdown" on Grooverider.It should be noted that this cd may not strike you as amazing right off the bat but after hearing the tracks a couple times they really grow on you and you want to hear them again and again. Both DJ's keep the bpm nice and fast at around 180. One small criticism I have on the Fabio cd is that I wish he would've mixed in a different track from the new High Contast cd than the one that every one knows, (Racing Green) plus it kind of sticks out of this mix like a sore thumb. I think "Yesterday's Colours" or "Twilights last Gleaming" would have fit better in this mix. But still the Fabio mix is great, it definitely has a unique sound, blending "patina'd" vocals with very tight beats but keeping and all-around analog sound.The grooverider cd has some weak spots like the first track, and some very repetetive tracks stuck in there but more than half are sweet hard hitting d'n'b tracks. They are definitely unique, and I also especially love the "Tomb Raider" track with the sample after the horse whiney, "Easy boy, that bassline ain't even dropped!"Enjoy!
Total amateurish punk pop, done a thousand times better by a thousand different bands since 1976... This is much like what you've heard those annoying neighbor girls playing in their garage. Nothing stands out - neither playing, nor songwriting. Go listen to Legal Weapon, Super Heroines, Holly Vincent, Echobelly, Elastica, Yeah Yeah Yeahs...
Excellent hair spray that imparts a natural hold that last all day. Absolutely no flaking and this spray doesn't leave my hair dull. Hair stays soft...not crispy. Smells nice. The scent is mild.
In terms of mood, lighting, and just downright creepiness no version of Dracula made since has come close to this masterpiece. Max Schreck's characterization of Count Orlock comes the closest to the ancient Romanian folk tales of the &quot;Strigoi.&quot; When you watch this film you will notice the devices that other film makers have stolen, and even with modern technology at their disposal, have used to lesser effect. Now, if you prefer to have your films spoon fed to you, and your imagination is not up to the task, then don't watch this film. to those of you who are able to dive totally into &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; you will come to the same conclusion as countless others: This is the best Vampire film ever made.
Brought to America by the people who gave us The Strokes and The Libertines, Scottish band The View is a quintessential, supercharged British Power Pop outfit specializing in sub-3:00 slices of controlled mania. Already stars on the other side of the ocean thanks to the catchy hits "Superstar Tradesman," "Wasted Little DJs" and the current "Same Jeans" (I've worn the same jeans for four days...), The View wears it's influences on their sleeves and veddy British they are - Oasis, The Clash, Madness, Squeeze and even T. Rex. Yet somehow the impression I kept getting was that of Herman's Hermits on crystal meth. Not that that's a bad thing.Spurred on by the fantastic work of lead guitarist Pete Reilly, The View is angst-free fun which could bring back pogoing and other frenetic dancefloor gyrations. Songs like "Dance Into The Night," 'Skag Tragedy" and "Don" are almost epileptic fits set to music - and you can't help responding.And yet it's the shambling, acoustic "Face For The Radio" that sticks in my memory, perhaps because it brings the goings on to a screeching halt halfway through before they hit full speed ahead immediately following. Maybe we all just needed the chance to catch our breath because The View's "Hats Off To The Busker" is one wild ride.Climb aboard.
This is an interesting book. It reminds me of Walt Whitman's line that its not the book but a piece of the man himself that you touch when you read it. The writing was very clear, accessible, and left me with the impression that I was in the actual presence of Vimalananda. I could smell him.Having said that, this is the story of a Hindu shaman/sorcerer. Like a shaman he has powers, communes with spirits, is a healer and something of a joker too. Vimalanand has a great wit. And sometimes when he's in the middle of a serious story all I could think was, this guy's trying to pull my leg. You could almost see him winking at you in between the lines.As an approach to God, this is not for me. It's a very dangerous path, physically, psychologically and spiritually. As a westerner, I just listened. I didn't get the urge to go out and try this stuff myself. There are enough warnings in the book to that effect as well.The section on sexualtiy was very enlightening and surprisingly modern. However the practice of Vajroli is beyond credulity. I would have to see this with my own eyes to even begin to believe it's possible.I was just getting to the chapter on spirits and thought &quot;yeah, yeah. Right.&quot; One night I left the book in my car inside a cheap bookbag. The next morning I got into the car and found someone had broken into the car to steal the book. Nothing else was taken. I dont know if this was a synchronicity, bad luck or spirits, but it certainly made me wonder. I waited 3 months before buying another copy and finishing. True story.Bottom line: I would take it all with a grain of salt and with a lot of caution. This book packs real power.
I strongly do not recomend this DVD. It is recorded from VHS to DVD very poorly. Its a shame Amazon would allow product like to be sold .This is not EBAY.
I was hoping it would be softer but it's pretty hard to chew. There isn't much flavor at all. In fact, I can get more flavor with any licorice at the supermarket. I've bought many types of organic and specialty licorice and this was the blandest I've ever had...hardly any flavor at all. For the price I won't be repurchasing. Disappointed.
Still the best tank for BW film processing. This is a small tank for one reel. I usually process more than one roll at a time and this is perfect for the odd roll.
I have had nothing but trouble with this chopper. The plastic insert that fits over the blades doesn't quite fit, and it can take up to five minutes to get the blades to line up so that you can put the outer plastic ring onto the silver top. Except that it doesn't quite fit either, and the thing simply won't latch without fussing, which means the blades slide out of the plastic insert while you are fumbling with the outer plastic ring. It would be great if I had three hands, but I don't, so I'm throwing this junk out and replacing it with a simple ring chopper and wooden bowl like my mother and grandmother used.A cheaper Cook's Special chopper was much, much easier to put together than this waste of money.
If you buy the individual season sets (1-4) they cost 88.98$ which is 20$ cheaper.
Just a plastic box really. We since found much better cases that are smaller, cooler, and work better for the purpose of stornig games while on the go.
OK, that is a bit of a negative title, so I want to start off saying that I really enjoyed this book. One of the problems with the story of the Alamo is that it all too often is isolated in the time during the battle and not much of the events and lives of the participants are ever explored. This leaves a story disconnected from all that ran up to it, all that caused it.William C. Davis does an admirable job assembling the lives of three people who are somewhat elusive in the historical record until their "big day" at the Alamo (even Crocket has his blank spots in his history). It is important info that informs us all why these men were "that" Travis, Crocket and Bowie.He gives them life in a narrative that quickly moves in a conversational style. Further, he does an admirable job not judging these men on today's more "civilized" standards, allowing us to come to know the men as they were, in their day, without being weighed down by modern approbations and regrettable "social" historical analysis so popular with too many historians.Now the criticism: As my little review title suggests I feel that there was one road, one equally important, not explored that led to the Alamo. It is a road that is just as important as the other roads Davis explores; that of Travis, Crocket, and Bowie.It is a road without which the Alamo would not have occurred, propelling the three heroes into American mythology. It is the road traveled by Santa Anna.Of course, at 587 pages, this tome is already a bit larger than the average popular treatment of any particular historical event and it is probable that Davis struggled to keep the story under one thousand! Still, Santa Anna's journey was just as tumultuous, interesting and central to the story as Travis, Crocket, and Bowie's, and just as important.Davis admits that he started with the idea of a Bowie bio, so it isn't surprising that he dwelled on Bowie more so than the other two. But, given the re-direction he took with his story a little less on Bowie could have sufficed as the story of Santa Anna was included.After reading the book, I felt a hole in the story. Why, exactly, did the Mexicans do all they did? Not just during the months preceding the Alamo, but for the decade before. How did Santa Anna get to his position? What drove him to lay siege to the Alamo and that small band of Norteamericanos? I know Santa Anna is not the American hero that the other three are, but where is the hero without the villain?In any case. This book is highly recommended for anyone wanting a well researched story of the actions and personalities that led up to the Alamo. Even with that one small detraction, I say read it!By Warner Todd Huston
It was a good movie...and it makes you think! I watched this movie with four other people, only one of which understood it like I did. The other three people were quite confused about how the ending came about. The people sitting behind us didn't get it either...I won't say what they said since that would spoil the movie for you, but let's just say that they didn't get it at all!Anyway, it took me about half an hour to get everything straight with the one person that *did* get it and another half an hour (and some visuals!) to get one of the other people to understand what happened.If a movie makes you think that much, then it's probably worth your money! The love story was a bonus compared to the logic used to explain how the ending came about.Interesting!-Ater
My daughter loved this book when she was one and two years old. If we still had it, I'm sure that at age 4 she would be begging for me to read it to her daily. I threw it away last year when it was really worn out... I'm talking about she loved this book so much that she drew on every page and then started tearing out the pages and sleeping with them under her pillow.I give this book two stars because I hate it, and I'm the one who gets stuck reading it to her. I can't stand the stupid cars that look like a pickle, etc. This is why I hate Richard Scarry books. He didn't have a lot of great ideas. He just had a great publisher. I remember loving these books when I was a kid, too, but it was really like an addiction. Richard Scarry books are like junk food.
i love shanghai noon... shanghai knights not so much. i think this is worth it because you get two movies for the price of one thats it but if you can find shanghai knights for cheaper i would just buy that
El Topo is one of those movies that you have to watch at least twice before making a call on it. Between watching it the first and second times you need to Google and Wikipedia it. It's just better that way.I'd never heard the term "Acid Western" before researching El Topo but that's the best description of the film genre it belongs to. I don't know from personal experience but there's no doubt that you could drop some acid and maybe appreciate/understand this movie even more.Here's the Reader's Digest review version. There are two parts to this movie. This is the summary of the first part. Crazy cowboy kind of guy meets good looking Bi-Polar girl in the desert, things move along pretty well, and then she wants him to kill four other crazy gunmen to prove his love or something. You know how good looking Bi-Polar girls are. They didn't have credit cards back in El Topo's time so the girl had to screw up something. Great scenery. Great camera work. Crazy things happen.In part two El Topo is in a cave where a bunch of midgets and misfits have kept him alive after being shot in part one. El Topo has a completely different look and acts different to the point you start to question if part two is the same movie and storyline. It is. El Topo falls in love with a nice looking midget girl and also meets up with his son who wants to kill him. More great scenery. Great camera work. Crazy things happen.If you are a regular movie, Will Smith, kind of fan you are going to hate this. If you like finding cult movie crazy stuff that is just off the wall you will love it. It's not really fair to compare El Topo to Mondo Cane because El Topo is much deeper and has a story but parts of it are Mondo Canesque.Watch the DVD extra interview with Alejandro Jodorowsky (El Topo). He claims to have invented the Midnight Movie and says he got to have sex with all the women he wanted after El Topo hit the big screen. He doesn't say it in those exact words however.
... You should read this book. John Baird, a Hemmingway scholar in something of a bind, agrees to produce a forgery of a &quot;lost&quot; work of the great master. Since this would radically change his earth's future, a sort of inter-dimensional hitman is dispatched to kill him. Which he does. Sort of. Instead Baird finds himself in another, just so SLIGHTLY different alternate universe, where everything takes a somewhat different turn - Until everything ends in a rather grim, if not unsatisfying ending. You should do yourself the favor of reading it.
This is the only kind of battery to buy, The hybreds don't self discharge like regular NIMAs. Does Anyone want a a bunch of NIMAs that are dead when you are ready for use???
This is the only low fat cheddar flavored cracker that I have eaten thus far, that has not disappointed. They are difficult to find in stores.
This book is darling. It's is a classic, non-scary Halloween tale with beautiful, timeless illustrations. The simple story is about a little girl picking a pumpkin, rolling it home, chasing it as it goes awry, and making a jack-o-lantern out of it. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I think the "pumpkin moonshine" title (and some of the other language in the book) is slightly outdated. I didn't realize until the end what a "pumpkin moonshine" was-- it's a jack-o-lantern. I had only associated the word "moonshine" with liquor. If you read it to small children, the book may take a little extra explanation about how the words for things can change over time.
I just recieved this cd as part of my birthday present from my hubby. Let me tell you it is the best present I have ever recieved. John is at his all time best. The music just takes you away to a special place. You don't have to be a RHCP fan to love this music. Actually you will find more mellow music than their usual funk but it is just so pure and you can tell that every word comes from his heart. His voice has improved so much. Each song is better than the next. There isn't one song that I pass on when I am listening to this cd. John is a musical genius by far and a true artist with amazing talent. A must buy for any type of music fan. absolutely fantastic.
The movie was suppose to take place in a demention between life and death????? What ever that means. Stupid. The acting is not very good and I didn't understand who or what the killer was. The effects were ok. the only real gru-sum part for me was at the very start of the movie with the hitchiker scene. That is why it gets two stars other wise I would give it just one. Don't waste your money.
The only good thing about this mystery is that it is a real page-turner. She does manage to write in such a way that one wants to keep reading to find out what happens. I do like Inspector Lloyd and Judy Hill. But that's all I can say that is good. I knew I wasn't going to like it early on when the drug dealer comes to Curtis Law's apartment carrying a gun, and Curtis says he hadn't expected that. I mean, duh? Then there's Rachel. So beautiful that every man that sees her wants to take her to bed, so talented that she manages to decorate her home beautifully, and always dresses in gorgeous clothing. She's also very smart, supposedly able to figure out what everyone is doing and thinking. She's spent all these years with the rich and famous, but has never picked up even a modicrum of grammar. And, poor thing, the only way she can make a living is to sleep with anyone who can offer her anything. If she's that beautiful, don't you think she could be a model either for clothing or some girlie magazines. She's a slut for goodness sake! None of the characters were believable, but she was the worst. I only finished it because it was a selection of my book club, and all but one of those members thought it was awful, and definitely not worth reading.
OK notebook, had to be sent to hp for repair on soundboard and harddrive. It took HP almost 1 year to send my laptop back fixed, but with parts missing. The store, CompUSA kept a record of the parts sent to them too and confirmed that the battery never came back. The HP support team "supervisor" denied and yelled and made threats as a response, so the CompUSA manager just gave up and bought me a new battery since I also had their store's extended warranty. Couple months later, my harddrive is now clicking and I got the error prediction that I need to replace my harddrive. Could it be that HP gave me a refurbished harddrive? I guess I'll never know. Overall this notebook is good in terms of power and speed. I've watched DVD movies on it and played 3D PC Games. The laptop does get a bit hot due to it's desktop pentium 4 processor, but there are numerous fans to cool it. The battery also drains quickly, about an hour or so depending on what you're doing. I'd recommend this notebook for speed and price, but don't count on it lasting too long. Also, send to HP for repair as the very last resort, or you might not even see your laptop for months or even in one piece if it makes it back.
opera ever! It's very raw and authenic interpretation of both Merimee's and Bizet's story. Filmed in Spain back in 1984, the movie holds a special place in my imagination. Real places such as the cigarette factory, the bullring in Ronda where Escamillo received accolades for his bullfighting prowess. What I really liked about the movie are the performances by Placido Domingo and Julia Migenes. They brought Jose and Carmen to life with their dialogue and acting.Please buy this movie. You're in for a real treat!
I had to replace my aging cordless drill and the one manufactuer that I picked was Milwaukee. From all the opinions from other messageboards and friends that have one or more of their cordless V28 system...they are amazed. Now that I have their 4-tool kit, now I can saw WOW!I have only used the Sawzall and the drill and I am damn glad to have bought this kit. What made it better was that I was able to get a free V28 Impact Wrench!!! Super cool and I can't wait to use that and the circular saw.When using the Sawzall - it maintained cutting speed for well over a hour of use. The drill - I can feel the torque it generates. The last time I felt that was my old corded unit. I can see this kit last a greater amount of time than and more use than my now retired cordless drill.My hat is off for Milwaukee on designing and building one hell of a cordless system. Also damn glad to have gotten it on sale and one free tool!!!
Take some Smiths, some Joy Division, a little Depeche Mode, and a hint of Nirvana, with a singer who can be compared to Getty Lee. Then make it all much darker, deeper and sad! You'd have Placebo. I have listened to this CD more than any other album ever. It is simply brilliant! It is their best work and if I could only take one CD to a desert Island this would probably be it. (Although I'd probably commit suicide after about a year) Mind you it is not for everybody. You must like deep, depressing, androgenous music. Placebo is an awesome 3 piece band! They play catchy uptempo songs as well as slow ballad type songs and even get a little heavy at times. Brian Molko's vocals and lyrics are one of a kind. If you like alternative music with an 80's type feel or any of the bands I mentioned above, you must check out Placebo and definitely this album.
This trade collects the first six issues. I have never been a big Marvel fan but for some unknown reason, I picked up this volume and since then I have been hooked.The basic plot is that the author, J. Michael Straczynski (JMS) taken familiar heroes and their origins and totally twists them around to fit in the real world and in the process create something truly innovative. The main character in Mark Milton aka Hyperion who has crashed landed on Earth and have been found by a couple, that's Superman's origin, right? Yes but the similarities end there. Hyperion is quickly taken into custody by the US Military who sees his potential as the world's most effective weapon. The military hires agents to pose as Hyperion's parents, they monitor all his movements and raises him to be the perfect American citizen. JMS really fleshes out the armies intentions and methods, for example, Mark gets a dog for his birthday. The dog is chosen after searching through 47 breeds and then is named "Spot" in order to give it simplicity. Implicit throughout the story, you get a sense of impending doom that this charade is not going to last. We also see how the different presidents deal with Hyperion during his 20 years of surrogation under the military, starting with Carter, followed by Bush Sr. and Clinton.There are other chracters, i.e. Stanley Stewart aka The Blur, he is gifted with speed, then there is Amphibian whose mother committed suicide when she was born and her father went insane. Next you have Nighthawk who saw his parents gunned down by Red necks and in turn became a rascist superhero. And finally you have Doctor Spectrum. Doctor Spectrum is the perfect soldier, who follows any and all orders. Doc Spectrum becomes empowered by the energy crystal from Hyperion's ship and can use the power to give his thought tangibility. He is the first line of defense against Hyperion.Despite the long review, there are lots of more stuff that JMS managed to pack into the story. The plot is dense and over six issues, JMS only begins characterizing the characters in the story. This is not for readers who want quick action with flash and bangs. This is a book best read slowly and enjoyed for the dialogues and characterizations. JMS is creating his little universe here and so far he has done a hell of a job.Ever since The Watchmen came out people have been searching for the next big Watchmen type story. I am gonna tell you that this book is as close as it has gotten to Watchmen status in a long time. If you can only read or buy one comics this year, buy this one. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed.One word of advice, this is from the MAX line from Marvel and therefore contains colorful language and nudity so, put the kids to bed for this one.
Shana Abe is not just a &quot;writer&quot;, she is an artist. This book was an emotional journey for me. Tristan and Amiranth are beautifully developed characters with whom we live for a time and whose story remains haunting and moving, well after the last page is read. I have read as many books by this author as possible. Shana Abe truly occupies a special place in the upper echelons of romance writers. Thank you, Shana.
I recently finished watching the entire first season of THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO and the episodes were even better than I remembered them. Karl Malden and Michael Douglas work wonderfully together and every story has the mark of a high-quality production, with beautiful location scenery and top-notch guest stars.As with HAWAII FIVE-O, the second season of STREETS isn't quite up to the level of the first year, but there are still quite a number of outstanding episodes. Highlights include HAREM, where former teen idol Rick Nelson plays a boyish pimp who lures teenage girls into prostitution; A WRONGFUL DEATH, in which Inspector Keller is accused of shooting an unarmed youth; and BETRAYED, featuring Martin Sheen as an ambitious businessman who uses every tool he can think of -including robbery and murder- while climbing the ladder of success.Looking ahead, the good news is that the best is yet to come: the third season of THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO is the finest year of all. Meanwhile, don't pass up this latest collection of exciting police stories in The City By The Bay. You won't be disappointed.
We call this our "fishies". I bought a 1996 version and later bought a 2001 version. The remote control with the current version is a GREAT idea! The music did not last long enough on the 1996 version. The music is a good length on the 2001 version, but my kids still push the button over and over each night. My kids are now 7 and 12 and still listen to this every night. When we travel to Grandma's house for an overnight stay, the "fishies" go with us! My 12-year-old is planning to move to her own bedroom soon and I wonder if she'll be able to move without the "fishies". Only criticisms: the cost and uses lots of batteries. It seems a bit too expensive to me, although it's obviously durable and has been worth it's weight in gold! Uses D batteries that need to be replaced fairly often. We always keep spares so there's no "fishy" emergency at bedtime. When the batteries start running down, my 7-year-old says the batteries need to be changes because it sounds "creepy". All in all, this is one of the best baby purchases we made and it has lasted for nearly 8 years now, with continuous nightly use. Highly recommended!
For the past 2 summers, my dog has had bad problems with scratching and hot spots. It's not fleas cause I have him on Frontline and I constantly check him. Took him too the vet and $250 later was given the diagnosis that he has itchy flaky skin and some sort of allergy but to pinpoint the allergy would almost be impossible. So, after giving my dog a cortisone shot, the vet recommended I give him 3v caps. They were much more expensive at the vets, and this skin formula on Amazon works even better. These caps are miraculous, my dog's hot spots are starting to grow hair and and he scratches MUCH LESS! I hated seeing my dog suffer, but now I give him these caps, 2 a day. I give him the caps whole in his food and he seems to think they are a treat, he loves them! So, try these, your dog will thank you!
Just when you think Peter David can't get any better, he steps up to the plate and belts one out of the park again. It's no secret that I think New Frontier is the most exciting Star Trek series out today--television, movies, print or otherwise. Peter David has created a universe that positively hums and the best part is that we're allowed to watch the characters grow and develop over the course of the novels. And for once in a Trek series (outside of DS9) previous actions have consequences in the long-term story arc.The latest book in the series is no exception. This book, which I think is one of the longest New Frontier efforts David has given us, is an enjoyable read from beginning to end. Whereas the previous book in this latest storyline read as if written at warp speed, this one is content to unfold slowly and delicately, giving the reader a chance to slow down and enjoy the worlds David has created. First of all, I will say this--Calhoune is not dead and there is praise all around. Secondly, we get to Shelby in action as the captain of her ship and it's a joy to read. It's amazing how far David has taken a one-time character and developed her.But the real strength is the supporting cast. David gives Calhoune and Shelby real people to interact in their respective stories. Indeed, characters who may only get a few paragraphs of book time are memorable and interesting.I will say that the ending is a bit much at times, but it's a fun rollercoaster ride and one that is worth taking. I can overlook certain parts being overdramatic when it's done with such obvious joy and zeal.So, by all means get to a bookstore and get this one. It's superb and a great wrap-up to the trilogy. It's not got a huge cliffhanger as the last four books have. But instead it's got an end that will leave me curious until the next book comes out in October.
I won't argue with people. I will just give you my opinion. THIS IS GARBAGE!!!! This is some of the most weak, corporate, made for radio rock I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. They sound like Bon Jovi with heavier guitars. And need to be put to pasture for their hack job on the classic song Simple man.
This is the only gel-free diaper which is closest to cloth diapers because of absorbency from cotton. This is the only good news.The bad news is that the sizing is too large for newborns. The diapers leak, have no elastic around the waist, and are fastened by tape that stick to the babies skin.
I usually don't rate movies at all that I would rate one star (not even that much if I could in this case). They don't deserve the attention. But this one did for the following reason. I read that part of the director's inspiration for the film was Pasolini's movie "Salo, 120 days of Sodom". The only thing that shocks more than the film is that anyone could think that this `product' has any artistic merit or is in any way comparable to Pasolini's work.There is no artistic merit in either Centipede film. It has no value as any kind of social commentary whatsoever. It is pure and simple torture, and the emphasizing of the helplessness of the victims. The connection between the suffering individuals is not a glimpse of humanity, it just emphasizes the helplessness in order to magnify the suffering. I'm sure someone out there will try to call it art, but remember the guy who defecated in a jar and put it up as an art exhibit? Remember Piss Christ? These are things people do because creating real art is hard work, and they've no idea how to create art. A film like this is an indication of the sterility and lack of ideas in the culture we've created.The doctor in the first Centipede was obviously a sociopath. The man in this film is probably sociopathic and psychotic. The "I've been bullied so I'm going to make you suffer" motif doesn't lend anything to the film at all. I'm not recommending "I Spit on Your Grave", but at least the character development lent some believability to the revenge-torture in that film. But what also strikes the audience in that film is the emptiness of the revenge. You don't even get those feelings here. It's like fishing people off the street and ripping them to shreds. All it has going is the shock value. Once it wears off, you wish you hadn't watched this at all. Perhaps the idea of being shocked can be likened to the fact that heightened arousal leads us often to sleep with someone we normally wouldn't touch, and getting the feeling after that you'll never be able to wash the taste out of your mouth. We want to be shocked, so we watch it.There's not enough character development for any real connections to be made with the people involved. It's just a pure torture flick that is attempting to make money off of the pure depiction of suffering with a gimmick. So, don't expect any character development or any kind of real human interaction in this film. It's pure torture. The assailant doesn't speak a line in the film.Don't pay money for this film; I don't recommend watching it at all. Spare yourself.
I got two of these and framed them to complete my bathroom in all Eeyore. It looks so cute.
Big fan of Kyuss. Liked "Restricted". LOVED "Songs"- thought it was brilliance. But this, sorry to say, is a total disappointment. Where's the aggression? The melody? The balls? The hooks? the SONGS?? It's like Homme took all his most repetitive ideas and made a messy, boring joke just to see who was still listening. There's the odd good riff; he's talented, after all. But mostly it's totally flat. I hate it. I'm giving my copy away. Spend your dinero on the new "Corrosion of Conformity" instead, it's MUCH, MUCH better music. Peace!
I purchase this camera for my girlfriend for her birthday and she absolutely love it! after try the camera for a couple of minutes I end up buying one for my self (on a different color of course) the same model in black looks awesome, very high resolution, perfect size, good zoom, and the metal finish look really sleek
I have written reviews before about the Konami Winning Eleven 7 and I gave it a 5 star. You have to understand that before I played the W11 series, I used to play EA FIFA games which are a shame in comparison to Konami. I gave this game a 4 stars for a few reasons which I will discuss. The gameplay is still fantastic and definitely gotten better with every new game. On the other hand the graphics are still not the best and have to admit EA have beaten Konami in ONLY that department. Another thing I would like to state is the difficulty levels in the game are a little weird. 1 star is very easy, 2 stars is also easy and,just like the 1 star, opponents don't speed up to run after you, but on 3 stars it gets really difficult, where the opponents move the ball quicker than you and start hounding you when they are defending. I believe the 2 star should be somewhere in between to get better practice. They still have flaws in the game especially with the random switching of players you are trying to control when the ball is centered between 2 or 3 of them or when defending. These are very minor problems that can be fixed but other than that game is incredibly good and worth it.
Written by a UK fan from when he first saw Chuck Berry on tour in Bristol in the 1960s, Collis avoids many of the problems in such lifetime fan tomes by covering the many dislikable personal and business aspects of Berry's character alongside a career history of the man's many momentous recording achievements.The start of the book after a short bio over view is background on why St Louis is an under rated music centre versus Chicago and Memphis in US history, identifying the key influences on Berry's music alongside Chuck's key early life history. The main meat of the book is its central chapters with a lengthy coverage of Berry's recording history and live performances across the critical 50s and 60s. Collis's detailed comments on the mixed bag approach of Berry to recording and highlighting those gems which have all stood the test of time thankfully avoids it all becoming a tedious listing of sessions data. The later chapters given Berry's lack of real recording activity and consistently lack lustre live shows since the early 1970s (a feature I have sadly personally experienced several times) make a valiant effort covering such key events as his trial for tax evasion and the 60th birthday bash organised by Keith Richards.The sad conclusion is that early setbacks and bad experiences (both racist and financial), especially his imprisonment in the early 1960s on sex charges, resulted in Berry having an ongoing lack of trust of anyone and a penny pinching and control freak approach to his career, whatever the consequences. His own lack of personal vision meant he never would look to a powerful manager or record producer who could have helped him apply a greater business acumen and discipline around recording and live shows. Two examples epitomise this quandary- the inability to turn his country club Berry Park into a successful venture probably owes more to his failing to add golfing facilities than the claimed police harassment and if he had made the investment in a good permanent live backing band (such as Fats Domino did), the man would have probably cleaned up on the financial rewards from world tours.Collis has clearly had no major direct contact with Berry though given the man's approach to interviews documented in the book this is no great loss it seems. He is thus reliant on using all other sources available including interviews with some key associates notably the much abused pianist Johnnie Johnston to fill out the story. The overall result is a pretty balanced account and while many such as Keith Richards may have ended up hating the guy, Collis does a pretty good job of creating the overall historical context while not seeking to justify the resulting behaviour of one of rock'n'roll's true innovators.One finishes the book aware that since it was written in 2002 Berry has continued as before so nothing it seems will change at this late stage in the man's life. Indeed, one is left feeling that Berry is in many ways a rerun of an earlier 20th century black hero Jack Johnston who in personal attitude and approach was consistently oblivious to the long term impact it produced in others.
A wonderful example of what a romantic futuristic book can be (this is how it is being marketed). This book also has a very lovely historical romance feel to it. Yet never once does it feel like a bodice ripper. This is a sweet and almost innocent love story. The author will give you just enough narrative in the love scene and then leaves enough to our fertile imaginations to fill in the rest.This is a book that is filled with misunderstanding, since the 'Warprize' really never gets any of her questions answered, nor does she feel it is appropriate to ask so many question since she is only a slave. Or so she was told by her brother; the defeated King who gave her up to the conquering hero, the ultra-blue eyed and very sexy hunk Kier.Richly written characters, a fully formed world(and I find that unusual with first books in a min-series like this one is), adventurous enough for most people and each book coming after this one will be just as good if not even better, as they go off and deal with their enemies, plagues etc. (I have read the entire series)This book withstands the test of time and will be a pleasure to re-read in future years as it was the first time you read it. And a big plus is that this is not a book where the hero or the heroine is filled with self-loathing or any angst at all. It was such a pleasure to read a book (series) in which the characters actually are content with themselves.
This is a review for the Criterion Blu-Ray version...BD buffs will already attest to a 'no contest' that BD picture and sound quality surpass that of any DVD. Take that approach and apply it to a classic film... once with dust, scratches and a poor audio track. A transfer that was once just available in 4:3 pan & scan. The Criterion edition does not disappoint! I had owned the VHS version of the film for many years, and comparing the two is almost comical. Remember that time when you first compared the same film on DVD and BD and suddenly noticed a million improvements? That's how I feel about this transfer.Of course, you have to appreciate the film for what it is, the director, and when it was made. You're not going to see some amazing James Cameron-esque special effects and lighting here. Back then there was only so much independent filmmakers could work with, quality of film stocks included. That being said, the grain even still seems to be almost eliminated. Not as if you're watching a film that was shot in HD (you can still pick up on the film grain and the slight 'jumpyness' of the film gate - which adds a lot of charm) but an immaculate version of how the film might have looked with its original intent.Criterion is doing a great job with these BDs, having enough common sense to wait for the HDDVD/Blu-Ray war to end in order to focus in on having reputable and pleasing transfers. Criterion has shown some signs of slipping in the past. As they grow their criteria for films seems to thin a little, expanding their catalogue to include films like Benjamin Button and Michael Bay movies... all politics aside, they still deliver wonderful transfers and now that they've gotten cracking on the BDs I am sure they will continue to improve and hopefully still maintain the reputation they once established for themselves delivering classic and contemporary movies for everyone out there.Also, you'll be glad to know that Criterion was smart enough to eliminate those ugly blue cases that most BDs are packed in. They have more specially made cases that are clear and just a couple millimeters deeper (the spine, presumably to make more room for the booklets). Much more attractive on your DVD case than a row of neon-blue cases.
I love this shrink Film!!!! It is very easy to work with!There is very little smearing and is east to manipulate for 3-D crafts as well.
I've long been a fan of DB's "Shades of Technology." In fact I even bought a copy to replace my burned copy. I decided to check out this one as well, and well, I have mixed feelings. There are some really cool tracks, like the first one, but it seems like this cd slips into a "deiselboyesque" style for the majority. Maybe DB is trying to win back the "hardcore d'n'b fans" with this album, which is chock full of super hype d'n'b (which isn't quite my fav) that's kind of repetitive. This is QUITE a departure from the "ambient jungle" and even the harder tracks that I loved in Shades of Technology. To be honest I'm really starting to like these more hype tracks. They're definetely growing on me... which is why I increased the rating. Just don't expect shades of tech. when you buy this one.
I have the same bad experience as other recent reviewers. The peppermint smell is overwhelmed by a foul nasty odor. The product is nothing like the (german) peppermint oil I used in the past. It is either contaminated or the result of a nasty chemical extraction instead of steam extraction. If this product was FDA regulated it would be recalled and pulled off the shelves. Totally useless (except maybe for repelling mice, if that works at all) and potentially toxic.Thanks to the other 1* reviewers I ordered only a small bottle and minimized my losses.Maybe this is just a bad batch (other reviewers obviously love the product) but I am not going to try my luck a second time with this manufacturer.Looking for other suppliers........
Mr. Woollcott was one of the founders of the Algonquin Round Table -- an informal lunch group that included some of the best writers and editors of the 30's and 40's including Nathaniel Benchley, Dorothy Parker, and Harold Ross. Many were from Ross's magazine, The New Yorker which he created.As I was using this to research a letter I had, I did not read the whole book. (And my Woollcott letter wasn't included. Apparently, he wrote a great MANY letters over the years.)There doesn't seem to be a Woollcott bio in print, so this one of the few sources of information about him.
Death-metal is great if you're talking about Morbid Angel, or maybe just maybe Nile. The rest is passable. Enjoyable! Fun! But not great. Every Nile album hangs tough with content, substance, composition, musicality, originality, (dis) ambience, instrumentation, psychic mazes (psychadelia), SPEED, and brutality, when compared to Morbid Angel. In fact, Nile surpasses Morbid Angel on the brutality factor by a significant margin! That is the reason I'm not a huge fan of Nile. They are just too brutal for a wimpy mortal like me. I prefer rockers like Bolt Thrower, or Morbid Angel. But "In Their Darkened Shrines" shines. They pull it all together. This is the total package. Better than any other Nile album, including "Those Whom The Gods Detest".
Our little poodle "Joey" loves this toy. I love the way you can regulate the dispensing of his kibble. He is quite the chewer and after reading some reviews concerning that I was hesitant to order it. I figured for the price it was worth a try. I am so glad I did because he hasn't made even a dent in his and it adds interest for him to figure out another type toy and how to get into those treats! Pretty cute to watch. I even ordered another one to have on deck whenever he does start chewing up this one.
... This might be described as a cross between Neurosis and Today Is The Day, but comparisons are pointless here. If you have any notions of being a post-hardcore(Drowningman, Dillinger Escape Plan etc)connoisseur then this is imperative.
I've worn Opium for over 25 years. I'm very disappointed that they've changed the formulation. If it ain't broke ... don't fix it. Returning it .... I want my money back!
I am a 50 year old German, who has lived in Germany all my life, except for ten years (1980 - 1990), when I lived in the USA.I do not know, which Europe Mr. Rifkin has seen and tries to describe - certainly not the one I know!At times, he confuses the issue, as when he describes the high productivity of Germany, ignoring our 10% unemployement rate, with zero productivity!On page 60 he predicts, that "... the 25 Gouvernments will ratify the European Constitution.." Well, two countries asked their people's opinion, and both said NO, effectively halting the process. So much for his predicitve power.A whole chapter is devoted to NGOs, or CSOs, as he prefers to call them, praising them to no end. He thinks, it is a sign of progress, that these CSOs participate in the European Gouvernment. Not one word is said about the fact, that they lack any democratic legitimisation (Hitler's NSDAP could also have been called a CSO) - what they generally do not lack is agreement with Mr. Rifkin's ideas.Dispersed all over the book are "philosophical" considerations about the shrinking of spatial / temporal planes; sentences, which remind me of "The Emperor's New Clothes".About 80% through the book, I shelved it with disgust.I experienced the American Dream: It is alive and as important now as it was 200 years ago; even George W. Bush will not be able to kill it.I am afraid, the European Dream exists only in Mr. Rifkin's head.
DON'T buy the cd!!! Wont play on your computer!!! I bought Creative Gigaworks S750 and i cannot listen on my computer!!! CD is bad anyway!!! Manny showed us a big F*%k You - so watch out for this CD!!! Don't BUY!!!
This album has the worst producers ever. This girl can sing, but her voice is wasted on such pathetic excuses for songs. Tamyra, do yourself a favor, and never work with those people again!
...and I didn't particularly care for that, either.Maybe I'm alone here, but I've never really equated Christianity with being corny and appealing to the lowest common denominator. Take Bill Cosby, for instance. He's Christian, andBill Cosby, Himselfis probably one of the most hilarious stand up shows I've ever seen, and it gets funnier and more relevant as I get older. I'd gladly watch it with the most devout Christians I know, content in the knowledge that everybody would find parts entertaining, and that only the most sheltered individual alive would seriously take offense.Thou Shalt Laugh 4, however, is not very funny. It's "funny" in the "groaning to be polite" sense of the word, and really did remind me of counselors at a Bible camp I went to in fifth grade. Some of the comedians try their hands at observational humor, which lacks the "humor" component and is mundane at best. Others get a bit more ham-fisted with the Biblical references to the point that it all becomes a bit contrived.I suppose if you've got something to prove to your local priest, minister, reverend, etc., or if you absolutely despise cerebral entertainment, this might be up your alley. But if you're just looking for something funny that you can enjoy with the kids in the room, you're better off looking elsewhere.
This is o.k. as a hard album for teenage girls. You could also say womens basketball is good basketball for women. But why would I want to really get into anything that can only be a marginalized version of the REAL thing?One of my fellow Amazon.com reviewers, in an effort to defend Kittie, asked:"Think of Cannibal Corpse or Morbid Angel, could you thinkof Kittie as one of those?". Well, no I couldn't. Those bands feature drummers who can play continuous double bass at lightning speed with a plethora of head spinning technical changes.Kitties drummer is barely at the level of Greg Gall on the first Six Feet Under album, which is pretty spiffy but mere childs playcompared to the type of thing you hear on a Cryptopsy album.The singer is definetley talented and nails the mid range Death Metal vocal style perfectly. And the melodic background vocals DO give the songs a dose of originality, but Arch Enemy has a female vocalist thats even better at that sort of thing and with a backing band that is MUCH more dynamic and technically talented. .And its Kitties lack of truly Death Metal level muscianship (once again, it's pretty hardcore in comparison to Hole, but a joke compared to Deicide, just as the best WNBA player is pretty good in comparison to me, but nothing against Kobi Bryant) that kills my interest. That and the fact that they are obviously targeted(marketed) towards little girls so they can feel like they relate to something "Really Hardcore metal." I'll debate anyone who cares to argue.
.Many of us as children would have first discovered the wonder-full world of science, by doing chemistry &quot;experiments&quot; and studying minerals. Oliver Sacks, when recounting his boyhood, takes us back to that time, when chemical reactions with their magical color changes, would open a child's imagination. This could feed their curiosity, and in turn, put them on a path to knowledge.Sacks writes with crystalline clarity. He describes his childhood passion for science in a way that is intense, immediate and refreshing. Have chemical properties ever been described so lyrically? &quot; The color of lilacs in spring for me is that of divalent vanadium. Radishes for me evoke the smell of vanadium&quot;.Science for young Sacks went well beyond the bounds of facts and figures. For him it was almost a sensual and at times a spiritual thing. He uses musical analogies when describing the harmonics inherent in the symmetries of the Periodic Table of Elements.Sacks unashamedly worships his scientific heroes. The great French chemist Lavoisier, was the first to develop a symbolic notation for chemical reactions that went beyond the simple icono-graphics (shorthand or cryptology?) of the alchemists. Sacks equates Lavoisier's &quot;Elements of Chemistry&quot; with Isaac Newton's &quot;Principia&quot;.With the invention of new scientific languages (eg chemical equations), advancement was no longer limited to the empiricism of the laboratory bench. New materials and processes could be conceptualized as &quot;thought experiments&quot; or put on paper, well before their actual discovery. Sacks marvels at the ability of the pioneering chemists who predicted the existence of new elements, purely by reason and deduction.To the average person, science is often seen as a dry, cerebral, passionless activity. Sacks's strength as a writer is his ability to capture the exuberance and enthusiasm that underpins and drives most scientific ventures.Many of Sacks's observations, although superficially simple, are in fact, profound. He reminds us that the crystalline symmetries seen in minerals are reflections of underlying atomic structures. Metals look metallic because of their surface's interaction with photons.His personal voyage takes us from the simple causes and effects of the pre-quantum mechanical world of his younger days to the probabilistic uncertainties of the causeless (blameless?) adult world.Sacks' writing provokes the thought, &quot;how many quantum-related phenomena can we now see in our macro-world?&quot; The random walk of Brownian motion (at a micro level) is everywhere, but the inverse-squared relationships (at a macro level) that are a consequence of Brownian paths, lead us to those step-like jumps that define &quot;events&quot; all around us, for example, everyday photoelectric phenomena.Oliver Sacks must take the prize for being the most accessible writer of things cerebral. He doesn't allow his own intelligence to get in the way of being a clear communicator. His modesty is engaging. The understated revelation that it was Sacks as a 12 year-old on a British radio quiz show in 1945, who got Glen Seaborg to reveal the discovery of the latest trans-uranic elements, is buried in footnote 11 on p210.One of the key messages in these memoirs is the importance of mentors to the young, growing mind. It was the advice, influence and support from Sacks' relatives, in particular Uncle Dave (U. Tungsten of the title) that allowed Oliver's potential to blossom.There is only one detectable blooper in this biography, but whether it was Uncle Tungsten's or the author's is unclear. It is on the subject of the origin of diamonds. On p37. Uncle Dave is quoted by Oliver as saying &quot;they are brought to the surface in kimberlite, tracking hundreds of miles from the earth's mantle, and then through the crust, very, very slowly, till they finally reached the surface&quot;. Yet, on p129, one of Oliver's heroes, Sir Humphrey Davy is &quot;burning a diamond&quot;. Most geological textbooks will tell you that for diamonds to make it through to the earth's surface they have to be transported from the mantle extremely rapidly to avoid being turned into graphite or CO2.The underlying theme of &quot;Uncle Tungsten&quot; is the convergence and ultimate unity, between man, the material world and the transcendental. It takes somebody with the intellect and power of communication like Oliver Sacks to convince us that our physical world, the domain of mind and ideas, and whatever is beyond, are bound together inseparably.This book has to be rated as one of the best memoirs of its kind. Oliver Sacks' earlier works must now become essential (re-) reading.
I actually saw this movie when it first came out, and was so blown away by Robert Downey Jr's performance (he was just starting out on his illustrious, if self-destructive career) that I didn't notice much else about the movie, certainly not Jami Gertz or Andrew McCarthy who are as close to being ciphers as it's possible to have on the big screen. (The adults in the film are as cipheresque as the kids, so there is no real dramatic interest there -- we have only the kids, and their interactions with drugs, the party scene, and each other.)Seeing it again 25 years later, well ...Downey's performance still holds up, but the rest of the movie is less than zero (sorry). The director is so absorbed with staging endless party scenes (unintentionally hilarious in their excesses) that he forgets to give the main characters anything interesting to do, and they never develop into anyone we care about. The final scene, with McCarthy and Gertz sitting forlornly in a cemetery, has no emotional payoff whatever-- McCarthy says come with me to the East Coast, Gertz responds yes, I'll go with you, and the viewer says, "Thank God, that means the movie's over."Finally, James Spader doesn't play a real character either, but as other reviewers have noted, he is interestingly slimy as the chief bad guy. Glad to see he's still getting work, in a fairly interesting role on "Boston Legal".
This album is the second installment in Sonic Youth's 'trilogy' and manages to be even stronger than Evol.The album starts off with the great Schizophrenia, which is definately one of the best opening songs on any album. The song is incredibly catchy and never loses its vibe or energy.The one-two punch of this album is really something, as Catholic Block starts off. This is easily one's of SY's most melodic and catchy songs of their year.Beauty Lies In The Eye is one of Kim Gordon's better songs, and is really quite a depressing song. She delivers the lyrics well in whispers.Stereo Sanctity is a truly great song, simply for it's melody and amazing bass lines, they just work perfectly with all the noise going around it. This is easily one of my favoritedemonstrations of catchy bass guitar in a song.Tuff Gnarl is a perfect example of SY's obvious tendencies to fool with the listener. THe song starts off kind of poppy and light but then just breaks out into one huge noise jam-fest. Both halves of the song are equally excellent.Pacific Coast Highway is a collaboration with vocals between Gordon and Moore and is really a nice addition, this is something that was devoid in Evol. PCH resembles Tuff Gnarl in the soft to jam-fest category except its not as radical.Next up is Sonic Youth's cover of Hotwire My Heart which manages to be as good as the original, although radically different.Kotton Krown is just catchy, to put bluntly.Master Dik is almost Sonic Youth's only rap-rock song. It's also one big jam. It's pretty good, but I don't think it manages to stand up against with some of the other songs.Sonic Youth again manage to create another classic album, that is near flawless. I'd say this is a bit more easier to get into than Evol but I'd recommend something like Goo to the new listener..
I am not going to say too much as all the other reviewers have done an adequate job. This is just a wonderful dvd with excellent singing, acting, costumes, and sets. One could quibble a little here and there about some of the coloratura on the part of the basses, but all in all everybody pulls together a wonderful show. Donose has such a desirable voice - I certainly hope we can get some more recordings of her in the near future. And the Dandini had such a beautiful sound. The whole thing is a delight. I've seen all the commercial Cenerentola's available except the movie with von Stade, and this is the best I have seen so far.
I tried to return mine to Amazon but the return window is only one month; it broke at nearly exactly two months. So I can't return it. The problem with this unit is its poor design for cleaning. Since the biggest reason I bought it was for my cats' health, this creates dirty water fast. And for some strange reason, the power cord separates at about mid-point, which means you can't run this behind any large appliance to get to that last available outlet.This is a good idea, but it is most definitely not ready for general use. My wife and I are terribly disappointed.
The performances are great and the background info by Abdul "Duke" Fakir and former Motown personnel are great before each song. The only problem is that in the special features section the "bonus interviews" are interesting but the video and audio are not in sync. Which is why this only rates four stars.
I thought I knew a little bit about copyright and trademark law, but reading this book really showed me how these laws, set up originally to help individuals, are now squelching everything from artists' creativity to new medical research. This book shows what can go wrong when big corporations and other money-hungry entities start trying to own everything we do under the guise of copyright/trademark law.The book is written in an entertaining manner and is an easy read. Some of the stories are amazing, like the copyright on "silence" and the patent on a method of swinging on a swing. I was especially struck by the point the author makes that creativity and research are being stifled by all these crazy laws, and the way these companies want to "own" our very actions.Although entertaining, ultimately this book depressed me a little, because I see this problem getting worse as time goes on.
Bodybuilder-turned-actor Mickey Hargitay made a number of films - mostly low-budget Italian productions - from the late '50s through the early '70s. In Bloody Pit of Horror, he plays Travis Anderson, a reclusive actor who thinks he's the reincarnation of the Crimson Executioner, a crazed sadist from the Middle Ages whose castle Anderson now occupies. Hargitay's ham-fisted performance may be one of the most unintentionally funny in the history of cinema. Recommended for Hargitay completists only.One star out of five.
You won't be disappointed in this carpet cleaner. It is easy to use and does a great job. It is amazing to see how dirt this can clean out of the carpet compared to the rug doctors that you can rent for the afternoon.
Fusion jazz and trance are the reference points for this Bavarian sextet's second album, though neither is entirely accurate. Jazz gives them their instruments and clubland their production values, but everything else -- their easy swing, thematic exploration, tonal warmth -- is a subtle mix. The results sometimes cross the line from deconstructive to clinical, but let's count our blessings; they could have sustained a lot more art damage, and the album's simple eloquence and sweetness prove it's no term paper. All nine instrumentals make good first impressions and remember new things to tell you with each listen. The quick songs never run out of gas, and if a slow song or two ducks into the background, that only makes this a nifty ambient album too.
I'm not a huge metal gear solid fan I'm more into splinter cell. I rented the first version of this game and couldn't get into it because the terrible camera angles; you really couldn't see much of anything and you had to rely on a radar just to find out if a gaurd was three feet in front of you, that was stupid. This new version has a pretty good camera system and that makes it a lot funner; you don't even need the radar anymore. I wish the guns could be used more like SC with an over the sholder view point, but other than that no complaints. The graphics for this game are amazing. I didn't even know ps2 was capable of this quality of graphics. It feels like I'm playing an xbox game. I love the night vision and thermal goggles, probably put in there for splinter cell fans. I also like the camoflauge idea it's real fun to see gaurds pass right by you and not even know you're there. I could care less about the story line and cut scenes, but you can jump right pass those without having to watch them if you're not interested in that type of thing.Good game, much funner to play now than the original.
I have read several NDE books, and this one was definately one of the better ones. When reading Dannion Brinkley's recounts of his experiences, one gets a feeling he is being brutally honest about himself. He admits to killing people in Vietnam as a soldier and enjoying it. During his NDE, he recounts feeling the all the raw pain and suffering he CAUSED to his victims and their relatives while reliving the incidents during his NDE. He described how he was quite a cruel human being, and how he was forgiven by God. After the NDE, Dannion transformed himself to an extremely altruistic individual. I really found interesting how Dannion described how he actually "felt" all the repercussions of his negative actions towards others, and how those actions affected many more others than the original "targets" of his negativity. Not only did he re-experience himself causing negativity, but he actually "felt" the receiving end simultaneously. I think his experience should make us think twice next time we feel anger, jeolousy, or anything negative. On the flip side, positive actions also reverberate throughout the world according to Dannion. I highly recommend this book.
If you can play, and you like Leslie West, you'll enjoy this DVD. You're not going to learn to play the guitar using this Video. He stresses "Tone is everything" and basically that's true. You don't have to be the best player in the world, but with great tone, you can do just fine. There is some cool stuff where he goes over the Amps and Effects he uses, and I love his humor! He tells you how he gets as much as possible playing the Pentatonic and Blues Scale. I got a kick out of one of his lines "Fenders are good on cars". He's always been a diehard Gibson guy, although I have seen him using Steinbergers,and Dean Guitars. He plays "Mississippi Queen", and "Theme" slowly, so you can see what he's doing. For the price of the video, it is worth it.
I saw this film in the theater back to back with Men In Black (what a contrast!). I found Contact to have multiple levels of philosophy mixed in with the wonderful special effects. The balance is excellent. You can &quot;take it at face value&quot; or dig deeper into the meaning of Jodi Foster's journey. Jodi is a fantastic actor, very convincing in her portrayal of steadfast belief in science before and her internal struggle after her trip. The supporting cast was excellent.Was it all a hoax or was it real?? If you let it, it will spark some introspection!
This was one of the funniest movies. It probably helps that I like Arnold. I think the story line was great although it may have gotten a bit cheesy towards the end. Still very worth watching.
This series is hysterical. We love it. Amazon shipped in a few days. Great product and great service!!
These did not agree with my little dog, although he chews the dentist's best chips without any problems. My problem was the price. My fault, I know, but I didn't pay close attention to the size bag. I found the same thing at the drug store for $2.98! Couldn't believe I wasn't more price savvy.
This is different than any of her other CD's. At first, I admit, I wasn't enthuised about this CD. The sound was different, and each song sound similar. However, once I really began to listen, I really began to HEAR. She chose these songs for a different time / stage in her life. They describe her situation (I think). Seeing her in concert singing these songs (plus others) were incredible! I highly recommend that people who like Trisha give this CD a listen.
This one finally wraps up the whole series, although I found the whole series too long and in the end VERY predictable.
This cd is amazing. Midtown's &quot;Save the World, Lose the Girl&quot; is easily the best punk-emo cd since New Found Glory's &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot;. The guitar, bass and drums here are all top notch. Everything goes together really well, creating an amazingly satisfying experiance.Just Rock and Roll is one of my favorite songs ever. If you buy this cd for one reason, make it that. Other standout tracks are Direction, Recluse, Another Boy, Let Go, Such a Person, We Bring Us Down, Knew it all Along, Come On &amp; Resting Sound. As you can see, that's practiacally the whole cd. The only two songs here that I didn't list are &quot;No Place Feels Like Home&quot; and &quot;Frayed Ends&quot;, this is because these tracks are mellow and are nothing like the rest of the cd. That still dosen't mean that they aren't great songs though.Everything one here just sounds amazing. The guitar, the bass, the drums are all top notch and sound excellent. The lead singers are pretty good too, they remind me of New Found Glory's lead singer, except with a much lower voice.If you decide to buy one punk-emo cd this year, make it this one. It is one of the most satisfying cd's out on the market right now. I can't recommend a better punk-emo cd, aside from maybe &quot;Nothing Gold Can Stay&quot;. Get this cd now, and Just Rock and Roll.
This is an awesome pan. It's large, deep and a lovely shade of pink. I was worried about the color - pink can vary from the pretty to down right ugly. I'm pleased to report this is a nice medium pink - a little darker than the "Komen" pink but it's still very pretty. Don't wait if you like these - it looks like pink items are disappearing at an alarming rate. I am definitely buying the rest of the pieces. It's heavy but you want that in cookware. You will love these, I promise.
If you are in a Relationship, and either have Aspergers, or are with someone with Aspergers, then I think this book gives some great assistance for either party to understand the other, to understand their relationship, and to come to terms with any communication difficulties they might have.Very easy to read, and very easy to dip into, with some useful checklist (just what Aspergers people appreciate, no doubt).
This product reminds me of the cruel mouse traps that have sticky boards, totally horrible and inhumane. Put yourself in the position of the innocent flea, who only wants to survive. The fleas caught in this trap will suffer for days. How would YOU like that? Much better to vacuum them up and flush down the toilet, where they will be able to escape into the ground or river. THINK BEFORE YOU BUY THESE CRUEL PRODUCTS!!!
If you loved The Animatrix, you will eat up this title. It further extends and deepens the Matrix universe. I had to buy it because it contains TWO entries by the remarkable Bill Sienkiewicz. Just like The Animatrix (and other anthology tales), some stories work better than others. Even so, it's a journey worth taking. Swallow the Red Pill!
I was disappointed with this filming of the Hemingway story at a number of levels. The performances of Bogart and Bacall were the only signs of life in this otherwise dull and unimaginative film. The direction of Howard Hawks is largely to blame. While his early work has a certain excitement appropriate to its subject matter, by the late 30s he was already exhibiting signs of his worst excesses in films like "Bringing Up Baby" and "Only Angels Have Wings"."To Have and Have Not" isn't so much a bad film as just an excruciatingly dull one. Hawks made a film on the bet that he could make a film out of Hemingway's worst novel. Unfortunately, this gimmicky approach is evident in the film's story. Hawks' unerring "professionalism" is a real liability for the characters. Bogart is not allowed the moments of introspection and weakness that made his Rick Blaine in "Casablanca" such an enduring, iconic character in the cinema. Hawks plays everything at a medium pitch, unwilling to really let his characters or his camera breathe. There is, to be fair, a justifiably praised on-screen chemistry between Bogart and Bacall, though their best scenes together seem to belong in a different film. Hawks allows himself a witless comic relief character in the form of Walter Brennan, whose presence marred many otherwise good films of the period (Brennan was actually a very gifted character actor, but was dreadfully overused throughout much of his career).Finally, one has to wonder just what it is about the film that has earned it such praise over the years. It has much to do with the auteurist cult of Howard Hawks, undoubtedly. It's not a great film, though, and not even a good one. Curtiz achieved a far wider breadth of character and emotional intensity in "Casablanca", a film that Hawks' picture tries hard to be. Bogart and Bacall were probably better-served in Hawks' "The Big Sleep" two years later, in which they had better characters to sink their teeth into.As Hawks' work goes, it's a largely unimportant work, significantly less important than "Scarface" or even relatively minor efforts such as "The Crowd Roars" and "Barbary Coast", which at least are more successful for what they are.
"Solstice" is one of the best indie films I've seen to date. Everything works so well in this movie. There is very good character development, above par acting and directing, interesting backstory, plot twists with exciting suspense, really creepy atmosphere (a perfect location and setting for mystery/suspense; close to the swamps down in Louisiana), very good cinematography, and an unexpected ending with a twist. This film is very well paced and has you guessing around every corner as it gradually unfolds the story, a really good spooky story aimed at getting your attention and keeping it until the end credits roll. That's an 'A'.
I tell you, never in my life have i seen such good quality headphones for under twenty dollars. This headphones have such quality that is beyond great! Koss has nailed it! It can fit into any mp3/cd walkman device and whats best is that it comes with a volume control tab, so if you feel like blasting your music at a super high volume, you can! Although they can look a little bit dorky, they feel extremely comfortable when you put them on around your ears. You can of course adjust the fit of these wonderful headphones which also makes this product a better buy.If you want great quality headphones that feel comfortable, buy these ones made buy Koss!
I had heard Geoffrey Canada interviewed before about his memoir Fist Stick Knife Gun and was very impressed by his thoughtful memories of his S Bronx boyhood. This graphic novel, beautifully rendered by Jamar Nichols, is based on Mr. Canada's 1995 memoir of how violence pervaded his entire childhood in the S Bronx. The narration is very clear, matter-of-fact, and shows that a boy either fights or else becomes a victim. There is no place in-between-- a boy has to fight to protect himself, his friends, every single second of his waking hours in the S Bronx.I would have liked to give this graphic novel to my 7 year-old to read so that she can learn about how other kids grow up, but the numerous profanities will delay her introduction to Mr. Canada's work.Overall, very powerful and gripping. I read this in a single sitting and couldn't put it down. I was reading this book at the dinner table...
This may be the beginning of a new trend that will help to cut down on the use of printed paper, which is a good thing, but at $399, this device has a huge markup, and huge net for Amazon. There's absolutely no reason why this device should not cost $100 or less.Early adopters, enamored with a mobile e-book, who are willing to spend an exorbitant price for a gadget with a tiny screen, are forgetting the fact that newspapers and magazines are printed in color. Although a novel would be great on this little screen, I wouldn't want to deal with the eyestrain of using it daily to read periodicals.Like any technology, it's just a matter of time before a new model is offered for half the price, repeat, repeat, repeat, and you have a $49 e-book with color. I'll wait.
Well-written, well-paced, and well-researched. I only wish there had been more photos of the airplanes mentioned in the text.
Sorry, but I just don't agree at all with the hateful comments about Gwyneth Paltrow.Gwyneth doesn't get tattooed, steal other women's husbands, collect orphans, wear a vial of blood around her neck, get out of a car sans underwear, or shave her head in public. She doesn't wipe greasy hands on designer dresses. She doesn't get busted for DUI.She hasn't been married five or six times and all that other nonsense.Oooooooooooh....that's so boring.Gwyneth is a lady, a natural beauty who doesn't have to be constantly in the tabloids.She has two beautiful children.....and I think her husband is adorable.She and her family are nice and normal. Sorry if that isn't exciting enough for you Paltrow-haters.She was wonderful in "Shakespeare In Love", by the way.
I really wanted to like Dorothy Garlock's WITH HEART more, and it's probably one of my better and readable 1-star romances. I liked both our lead characters here, I thought the hero was slightly different from the historical-romance archetype, and I enjoyed their sparse moments of romance together. Not to mention the late 1930s Oklahoma backdrop constituted a new setting for me. Unfortunately, the bungling plot and pace of this 433-page paperback disappointed big time. The characters and passion in most romances usually supersedes any plot or more often, the romantic tension *is* the plot. Here, Garlock attempts to balance the plot having to do with surreptitious dealings in Rawlings, Oklahoma, with Kathleen & Johnny's burgeoning love. But since the passion and love was rather on the light side, the blundering plot really exacerbated the entire reading experience in this romance novel.Heroes and heroines from past novels crowding the plotting never sits well with me, and there's just too much of Keith McCabe in this novel, a hero from one of Garlock's prior novels, I presume. It seemed like this novel's hero Johnny Henry constantly deferred to Keith McCabe for help and building Johnny's characterization. For instance, light-hearted banter between Keith, his wife and Johnny molded Johnny's characterization from our heroine Kathleen's eyes during a dinner after the rodeo. Barker Fleming attempts to bond with his long-lost son Johnny after the rodeo as well while helping Keith ride his flock back to his ranch. Johnny mentions connections through Keith McCabe which could succor a dangerous situation our protagonists create from uncovering the surreptitious conspiracy in Rawlings, OK. And Johnny turns to Keith McCabe when he wishes to entrap a murderer as well. Too much Keith McCabe, enough already!I thought an episodic bookkeeping characterizes much of the plotting. There were too many times in the novel where Garlock painstakingly notes to include all the characters in the room before allowing someone to divulge pertinent information. For example, Kathleen makes Barker Fleming wait until Paul and Adelaide are in the room together before allowing him to share what happened at the clinic with Doc Herman. In a gossiping way, Kathleen asks Johnny whether he heard about the young girl in town (Judy) looking for her real parents. It all amounts to amateurish bookkeeping if you ask me. Worse, for over 3 pages, we're treated to a confrontation between a local merchant Leroy and our newspaper owners Kathleen and Adelaide when Leroy threatens to withdraw all local advertising. Kathleen fumes at Leroy for being spineless, and the entire altercation seemed pointless since we knew Doc Herman was pulling the strings and naive of Kathleen to prolong and provoke an altercation with an intimidated hireling. I think that dumb and pointless argument accelerated the book's decline while the melodramatic ending hammered the final nail in this book's coffin. Finally, it's funny and I'm probably bad for saying it, but I really didn't find our villain Doc Herman's clandestine activity all that condemning. I'm skeptical a profitable market would exist for his service: a pseudo adoption agency, providing homes for unwanted children of unwed mothers. Are there really that many affluent couples not able to have children of their own?WITH HEART mostly belongs to Kathleen although I thought our hero Johnny managed to make an impact as well. The passion is PG-13 though their connection wasn't any less resounding for it; in fact, I find more explicitly sensual romance novels involving a notorious libertine scientifically igniting a virgin's passion empty by comparison.
What struck me most about this movie is the uninspiring acting. Many times it seemed that the actors were just reading their scripts. Little or no emotion and empathy; they didn't become their characters. Clark Gable included.For example, the plane that was coming in for a landing with both pilots injured or dead. I believe the navigator was flying. The tone of his voice was like Ben Stein. If you're not used to flying a plane, it's all shot-up, and your crew is dead/injured, then you're probably a bit on edge. This fella sounded as bored and nonchalant as can be.In my opinion,Twelve O'Clock High (Special Edition)is a MUCH better movie. Superb acting. And it has to do with the same kind of war situation.Command Decision was so lackluster that I dozed off a couple of times; and near the end (maybe 20 minutes left), I just turned it off, because I didn't care how it ended.To see some of my favorite military/war DVDs, click on my name, then click on "Listmania! Lists".
Like many of you, I have seen this film many times, both in theaters, t.v. and home video. While the 'original' Dracula was always a favorite of mine, I would never consider it all that great of a movie.The Phil Glass score has given this film new life. It's almost like seeing the movie for the first time.
More .. Cameron Diaz dancing around in her underwear, and more old people talking about sex. This movie should have been titled "Something About Mary 2". A few of the jokes were funny, but most just made you groan. If you like gross-out slapstick like Something About Mary this is for you. If you like long set ups with punch lines that make you groan like Meet the Parents, this one's for you too.
Basic info: Music and score by Masaharu Iwata and Hitoshi Sakimoto. 2discs. Disc 1: 74:53 (42 tracks). Disc 2: 75:37 (29 tracks). Abouthalf of the tracks are listed in Japanese, but you can get Englishtrack names with a CDDB-equipped audio CD player on your computer.Ijust wrote a review for &quot;Chrono Cross&quot; and contrasted thatgame's gentle Celtic guitar with the march-driven synths, strings,horns, and ominous church-bells common in other game soundtracks.&quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; is a prime example of thelatter.Indeed, while FFT's themes are rich and melodic, there is anunmistakable ominousness and sadness to the music, which you'dprobably expect with song titles like &quot;Ovelia's Worries&quot;,&quot;Cry of Pain&quot;, &quot;Terror&quot;, and &quot;BloodyExcrement&quot;. It suits the game of course, since Tactics is theFinal Fantasy game where the heroes struggle in a deeply corrupt worldtowards very unhappy ends. Sometimes that's the mood I'm in, and itcan be great headphone music, but this isn't the game soundtrackyou're going to be playing with friends in your hotel room at theanime convention, that's for sure.More than most other gamesoundtracks I own, FFT is dominated by looping battle-theme songs.That shouldn't be a surprise, since Tactics spends far more of itsgame-time in 30-60 minute battles than in the exploring andrunning-around-the-town activities of other RPG's, but it naturallyaffects the needs of the soundtrack, and thus the collectionrepresented here....the DigiCuberelease (and not some SonMay pirate version), [with] the proper packagingincludes a lovely poster on brown parchment-like paper of the variousjob illustrations, with male and female geomancers, monks, time mages,etc. Mine also included a small collectible card of the summoned&quot;moogle&quot; character.
I bought this album because I heard the song 'Walk on the Ocean' on the radio and loved it. I was kind of scared by the cover art, and it occured to me that I might really be buying a really expensive single. However, I was pleased to find out I was wrong. Almost every song with holds up to the quality of 'Walk on the Ocean'.The song 'Butterfly' is really interesting in the use of contrasting melodies and, at one point the halt of music alltogether. 'Pray Your Gods' has a beautiful traditional hym at the end. 'Nightingale Song' sounds really neat, but its a shame its so short. Enough praise.'In My Ear' is to poppy for my taste. 'All I Want' is really kind of paint-by-numbers, I didn't really like it that much. 'Stories I Tell' has really good lyrics but the mood the instruments create really sounds inappropriates. I get the impression that someone pulling the strings said &quot;Hey, we need an 'angry, brooding' piece or the record's not complete!&quot;.In conclusion, I feel that as a whole this album is pretty good and a worthy investment of your time and money.
Wow. I've owned this album since it first came out and I have played it over and over. The guys' music is for sure not just for younger people. This album is a masterpiece. Every ballad is beautiful and every up tempo song was made to make anyone get up and dance. This album is definately worth every cent!
Getter Robo is one of Mazinger Z's (Tranzor Z on the US) brothers, one of the incredible Brainchildren of Go Nagai.Using all the key elements needed in the 70's, Go Nagai created (yet again) one of the most copied styles of robot, the Combining Robot. Getter Robo bursted into the scene with incredible trasnformation (arms and legs sprouting from a tiny ship create a giant robot), Multiple pilots and an array of weapons that was etched into the minds of millions.The success of the Original Getter Robo spawned Getter Robo G, and updated version of the Getter Machines, introducing a new pilot (after killing another one) and dashing new robots, once again, Nagai Sama did his job right, and we where all very, very impressed.It has been over 25 years since Getter Robo G, and Go Nagai celebrates its birthday with the title in question Change Getter Robo, or Getter Robo Armaggedon, Keeping the original cast (including a resurrected Musashi) with pretty much their 70's look (thick eyebrows, big sideburns, and above all, thick drawing lines), with spiked up animation.The quality of the art direction in this OVA is amazing, it starts to show once you realize that new characters look more like the ones in Evangelion (finer lines, big eyes).Finally i must say this, story wise is a little confusing, as a hard core Anime fan I find this to be a great plus, but some people may find this to be weird, also dont be fooled into thinking that you need to have seen the original getters in order to enjoy this masterpiece ( it does help thou), the story takes a whole new arc and past events are explained in detail helping newcomers to enjoy it as much as any 70's fan.Pick this one up, and you wont be dissapointed. It serves as a great insight into 70's animation, without the crummy video quality of VHS copies or ... translation. (the english track is pretty good, but it seem to be conflicting with the subtitles of the japanese track, weird)Go Nagai Rules!, Check this out and find out why
This has been one of the best books I've ever read. If your a person that likes guerilla warfare, like myself. I garentee you will fall in love with this series. Just like I did. John Marsden takes a girl living a normal life on a farm in Australia and makes her house in the front line. Along with her friends and nieghbors. Mardson describes her new world of fighting and danger so well it makes you feel like your sneaking through the Australien countryside with her fellow companions. I truly loved this book.
It says something about the writing skill of Poppy Z. Brite that a straight woman can create two such adorable gay male characters as Rickey and G-man. "Prime" is the natural extension of "Liquor" which established the bona fides of the characters in the restaurant business in New Orleans. As in the former, the kitchen-operation details are painstakingly authentic and entertaining, as are the quirky tidbits about New Orleans itself, arguably the oddest city in the United States. There is even less sex in this sequel than in the prior, but, hey, the guys are older and maybe that's real life! For all the good stuff, problematic is the convoluted plot involving the New Orleans DA, an investor in Texas, and a has-been chef who had an influence over Rickey. Frankly, I couldn't figure it out and it hurt my brain to try to do so. (Memo to Poppy: KISS.) Supposedly there is another book about Rickey and G-man in the works. I'll look forward to that, but meanwhile, I'll go back and read the first installment: "The Value of X."
I'm generally a big fan of Canson products. I was so excited to get my hands of one of these elusive books only to end up disappointed at how the paper would buckle under the lightest of watercolor washes. The paper also seems to suck my markers dry. So what exactly constitutes "All-Media"?It also has an odd texture that I don't much care for.I will not be buying another.
People have said this was one of pink floyd's most unaccessable albums, however, me and my friend logan, sat down and listened to most of the album, one day, while we were sitting around in my room, we loved it, especially &quot;Dogs&quot;, the guitar solo about 3 minutes into it, is soo beautiful, people need to have more harmonious (can't spell word, does it matter though?, you know what i meant) guitar solos, if more artists would take the time to dub over at least two guitars, i dunno music would be that much better, but music now-a-days doesn't even have good one-guitar solos, so its a kinda dead issue. Gilmour has a kind of smoothness and vibrant sound to his guitar, that makes it sound so great. Roger waters, is a musical genius also, he wrote the lyrics and most of the music, i assume, since his name is next to the titles as being the creator of it all? There was always a big fight amongst that band about stuff like that, i want to go back in time and slap them for that, they could've made more beautiful albums, like this one, if they'd not fallen apart. But of course if i slapped any one of them, i'd have to kill myself. I really like the keyboardist too, i forget his name, but hey man i know youre there, and you kick ass too. I love the pig thats always floating around in all the pictures, i dunno that was soo cool for some reason. Buy it.
This is a subpar effort from Lakeside. Real Love is strong, but most of the others seem to just &quot;go through the motions&quot;. There are a disproportionate number of ballads, and the upbeat material is stale (e.g. Raid). Try one of the earlier release for good funk.
He is the man. Refreshing music. True heat and true feelings. No show neccesssary - just the pure guitar sound from Mali. There, great guitarists are born and trained since decades. The &quot;Super Rail Band of Bamako&quot; is a living proof since over 30 years.&quot;The Source&quot; is a great start for anybody to get to know Toure beyond his collobarartion with Ry Cooder and a must for all, who know him.
When I opened the package, I was disappointed, as the vacuum sweeper looked like a child's toy. It is the bright yellow as pictured and a very lightweight plastic.I almost returned it without trying it out. Fortunately I didn't. When I assembled it and tried it out, I was pleasantly surprised that it really does work quite well for a lightweight vacuum. I have hardwood floors and two cats and a bad back, so I need something I can use at least daily. I was replacing a BISSELL 3106A Featherweight Lightweight Vacuum (the plastic parts broke off and it literally fell apart), and I would have to say after two months of use, it is much better. It is lighter, easier to use, works better on the pieces of carpet I have, and is less noisy.
My 4 year old son received this as a Christmas present. He has really enjoyed playing it so far. He can do most of the activities without help. There is one part where you have to ride a cart down a mountain and click buttons to duck or jump, which I think is pretty hard for little ones (it actually took me a couple of tries to make it down the mountain). There are many different learning activities: matching, memory, shapes, size, etc. We did not have any problems loading the game on our computer as another reviewer did. We have a new Dell computer running on windows XP.
This product is worth the money for those preparing dividers for a large volume of binders. The clever design of the tab labels allows the user to apply all 5 labels in the 5 divider set simultaneously and then peel off the connective piece leaving all 5 labels in place. For anyone that has meticulously placed each label on dozens or hundreds of dividers getting ready for a business meeting, or creating a conference folder, for example, this can make a huge difference in time. As well, the labels all go on straighter and more professionally. Nice innovation!It is also nice that enough labels are included with the dividers to put the labels on the front and the back of the dividers. **It's important to note though, that if putting the labels on the front and the back, the ones for the back need to be printed in the backwards order than the ones for the front.** They do not illustrate this on their materials, and if it was in the instructions, I didn't see it! This is important because there aren't extras and if it's done without that switch, the backs will have to be hand applied, negating the time savings!These labels are really best for those doing all 5 sets in the package at the same time, because making multiple runs though a printer with the same label sheet can be unreliable. Also, setting it up multiple times negates much of the time savings as well.The package also comes with standard tab labels that can be applied singly. All the labels can be handwritten as well.Recommended for those doing volume labeling. Those labeling a few sets or a single sit can probably find a cheaper version.
I decided I hated Clinton a few days after 18 of my brother soldiers were slaughtered in Mogadishu. It was the day the first load of wounded Rangers came back to the states. I dont expect Presidents to be standing tall every moment wounded troops come back. But I do expect they would have enough decency not to tout their health care initiatives by visiting wounded gang bangers on such a day (as Clinton did). I read this book a few years after that incident. Still hate Clinton and her husband......just not as much!Mr. Maraniss paints an interesting picture of Bill Clinton. Here is a truly brilliant man who learned the ins and outs of the American political system. A man who can spend a law school semester on the campaing trail yet manage to pass with some intense studying at the least moment (Im a law school grad an freely admit I couldnt do this!). But he also shows us the spoiled child side too. A person who was doted an indulged in his early years and who essentially got everything he wanted. Its no wonder he thought he was too good to serve in the military! Speaking of that Mr. Maraniss puts to bed for all eternity the draft issue. He makes it quite clear Clinton received an induction notice and then did everthing in his power to avoid service. Why should he serve his nation or follow his marriage vows? He was the best of the best and should be above the law!So there you go. The good and the bad of a very polarizing character in a very intriguing format. Clinton lovers, nows the time to hit the not helpful button and get the hate email flowing!
This is a very nice text covering a large number of topics in &quot;physical mathematics&quot; (if I may steal Sommerfeld's description). The sections on special functions and applications of complex analysis are wonderful. This is a great book to use in conjuction with Jackson's E&amp;M text; whenever a fellow grad student asked me this year about some Jackson problem, it turned out that a very relevant discussion was given in M&amp;W.A small warning: while it's possible to learn complex analysis directly from this text through the large number of applications covered, I wouldn't recommend it- my recommendation would be Churchill and Brown.
This knife has almost all of the tools of the Swiss Champ but for less than half the cost. My son, who owns numerous knifes, is extremely pleased with his purchase.
Put this on the edges of a plastic composit Kayak to get some grip for your shoes.. Has been holding up well, and seems pretty premanent! (it is fairly abrasive, but for your shoes that's good, I would go barefoot or anything)
My son is almost 5 and he breezed through this book way too fast though it was nice to see that he had to think about these before he did them. I bought a really big book of preschooler mazes at a wholesale club but he was able to cruise through that 200+ page book in a month of off and on use on the weekends. Both books cost the same. This book was defintely harder but after a week he had already gone through most the whole book. I have twins so I had another book - yes, I buy two of everything - so this time I took that one apart (after boy #2 rejected it for the most part)and didn't give him the whole book at once. Made that one last much longer. A good choice and the mazes defintely made him think about how to work them out before doing them - something he didn't have to do much of in other books we tried. A good and fun book. My other son didn't seem to have the patience to want to put much time into thinking about the mazes before he did them so he had no interest in it after a few uses. He found it a bit frustrating which I found odd because he is my "must color within the lines perfectly kid". I would recommend this book but it makes me wonder if it might be a bit too easy for a 6 year child.
Although this was an excellent concert you should be aware that one segment from the DVD (a very good segment) is missing. Carole does an oldies medley that is just great. I would have given this 5 stars had it been included. The performance was excellent.
For the little money I had, we made a great film. Best stunts and fight scenes in a low budget film in years, that they still stand up today. So good in fact, this film got us a contract with a Los Angeles distributor. Bad dubbing, so what! What the hell do you expect from a kung fu movie? I have neither the time nor space to go into the ever-broken camera, the 1 man film crew (me), the edit studio that shut us down because we ran out of money, the actors who quit halfway through filming, and the other ten thousand problems that almost killed the project. The fact is, we got it done and now its available worldwide. Sure, we would have hoped for a better film, but who would finance a film by a black filmmaker that did not involve the ghetto or rap music? I'd say we were pretty bold and ambitious for even trying. Give credit where its due. If I make a stinky film with millions of dollars, you can blast me all you want. I piece together a film on half a shoestring, hopes and prayers, you'd better think about that before casting stones. For the record, "Mister Laughing barfer", negative reviews don't bother me, but the question remains: how many films have you done? P.S. My new film "ROOM 13:The Terrorist Project" is headed for the Sundance Film festival. Even George Lucas' first film was a crappy 16mm sci-fi shlocker. Oh, to be in such grand company pleases me no end.
the first time I saw this book was online, in an msn community. a lady was posting the story on the message boards, I fell in love with it. The pictures are great, I love the story, this will be a book that I will treasure and I hope my kids will to for a long time. It is an enchanting tale, well illustated, and all around just great!!!! this is a must have for the fae lover, and nonfae lover alike, if not for the priceless pics, then for the adorable story line.
When I received the Walk Worthy Press novels to review for bookclubs, I was reluctant to read them because WWP doesn't seem to understand the difference between CHRISTIAN fiction and INSPIRATION fiction.For instance, in Sweet Bye-Bye, the author beeps out profanity as if she'd never used the words herself. Which in turn shows no valuable credibility to her characters' true selves. People have to come to the realization that Christian people DO INDEED use profanity and commit several sins. That doesn't mean that they are not a Christian. It simply means that they are a Christian who is not at the level of perhaps someone who is more stronger in the faith and who can resist the temptations.Christian fiction novels would be so much more effective if the writers come to the realization that their characters were once sinners and used profanity but eventually have grown to a level of Christianity to be able to eliminate those negatives. This is true Christian fiction. No one is born perfect and without sin.Temptation, Promises Beyond Jordan, That Love That Faith That Trust, are all great examples of INSPIRATION FICTION. There is low-keyed drama in Inspiration fiction and faith-based realism.Casting the First Stone trilogy and Church Folks/Second Sunday are wonderful examples of CHRISTIAN FICTION. There is always high-keyed drama in Christian fiction and a lot of truth and very much reality where most people can identify with the characters.A word to the wise at Walk Worthy Press: When publishers learn this difference, they will be able to better market their products and reach a worldwide group of people instead of a certain circle of folks. Don't limit God and don't be afraid to go into the highways and byways.Sweet Bye-Bye is a sweet and inspiring story but lacks the ability of pulling in the reader to believe the characters' stories. Partly because the writing was amateurish (most debut authors show this weakness). A 2.4 on the SmithScale.
Ingenious the way the book is layed out. Makes learning the body much simpler than conventional style books. Best book of this type that I ve seen yet.
Your the top gun here. and there is no stopping you from killing all bad guys. good guys in blue and bad in red. great overall game but weapons could be a little better and guns to reload could be better. you run out and have to reload a lot. and missions are pretty good. but ground stuff is hard to kill. but ok. in fact great cheats is tungha in profile name and then opens most everything. still fun game to play. my favorite high flying game is still. heatseeker. ps2 this is 2nd best. hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
I received PSO on August 2nd and, I must admit, for the first week or two, the game was great. After that the game became very repetitive. I got tired of going to the Hunter's Guild doing stupid missions (like risking your character's life and weaponry to retrieve a piece of cake for some chick who has a sweet tooth). So after a while, I just stopped playing. Then, on August 27th, I was bored and I signed up for SegaNet and tried to play online. Lemme tell you something; THE GAME ROCKS!!!! So many ships, so many blocks, so many weapons, so little time. It is a MUST to play this game online. Playing offline is OK for making your character a little stronger, but play online with a party of other players. Trust me, you'll build levels very quickly. This game would've received 5 stars, but the offline portion is very shallow when it comes to storyline and character development. I'm using HUcast right now, and I would like to know more about him. It gives the character that YOU develop a personal touch. If you don't know already, there's even a saber that looks like Darth Maul's light saber in Episode 1! I must have that weapon. It will be mine, oh yes, it will be mine. When I get it, I will dance, oh how I will dance. Also, if you don't have a keyboard (like myself) invest in one. PSO is a little more difficult when you're trying to fight and tell someone thanks for healing you. I would try and use all of your slots for preset phrases. It helps. Even though I am fond of the previous PS games, this was a decent breath of fresh air (PS4 was my fav, and PS3 was horrible). I was just jazzed about being able to use Meseta again as currency instead of Gold in so many other RPG's. So, in conclusion, if you want an in-depth RPG, I would say get Skies of Arcadia or Grandia II. But if you want a great Action RPG with the option of joining up with other Hunters from other parts of the world (and the Algol Star System), this is as good as it gets. I have seen the light, and it's name is Phantasy Star Online. See you online!!
Judge Aldisert writes that his family "never got too involved in the Madonna cult" (which is not really a "cult" but the due devotion for the Mother of God). Whether or not his family got involved, he may have spared himself and the reader the reproduction of an Italian curse in one chapter and of the invocation of God's name in vain in another. The lone star is for some vivid passages in the narrative.
This was the first book I read by Jen Lancaster, which is also the first book she wrote. I fell in love immediately with her writing style and devoured the rest of her books and frequently read her blog at [...] and follow her on twitter. She is absolutely hilarious, but be warned; she does use profanity. This doesn't bother me, but might bother some readers.The stories that she tells in themselves are not that interesting. It is her writing that makes her material impossible to put down! She is very honest and both confident and self depricating and many times says what most don't have the courage to say. I always literally laugh out loud when reading her material and obsessively wait for her next book to be released!Pretty in Plaid: A Life, A Witch, and a Wardrobe, or, the Wonder Years Before the Condescending,Egomaniacal, Self-Centered Smart-Ass Phase
BOught 3 for gifts this year , as I love the smell myself and so did all my friends and family . Has soft kinda romantic smell as in like clean fresh , vibrinat.
With those words, Bush showed his true colors and his true allegiance......and it ain't to the flag or the American people, folks. WAKE UP! This man is by and for THE RICH....and his own business interests. If you saw this movie you would understand that. And if you didn't, quit your bellyaching 'cause you don't know what you're talking about. No matter what you think of Michael Moore (and I'll admit some of his footage was shameless propaganda and had no place in a serious, hardcore documentary) you can't ignore the news-reel footage (most of which the American public never had a chance to see) and the documentation. This movie is a call for the general public to take their heads out of the sand and take a long, hard look at the smokescreen of American politics.
Though delayed, I wanted one for my Airport Extreme. Holds it well. Not only does it suit my Extreme but also my workstation, completely. Isnt too obviously visible either.. a good thought from Apple
RR was not only a great president; he was also a great intellect able to disseminate complex problems into executable actions. This book shows RR understood and respected the gray, but after coming up with a policy solution, kept it black and white to ensure his message was understood and show a clear path to meeting the objective at hand. This book is also a great collection of writings in his own hand that provide irrefutable proof that RR's positions were his, and that he was no mere actor or talking head.While RR does a great job laying out his positions mostly in the collections of speeches he wrote; I do have a few problems with this book and the man himself. First, we get it, the editor didn't need to include so many speeches that redundantly pound home RR's positions on a couple of topics, especially foreign policy. Once or twice is fine, seven, eight, nine times is overkill. Second, RR's reputation is one of unbridled positivism and optimism, and while he was a true optimist, its untrue, as this book clearly shows, that RR was an atypical politician that didn't go negative. The RR in this book would take an issue Carter was working and sometimes create a mountain out of a molehill, and like a typical politician, when Carter deserved some credit (admittedly a rare occurrence), RR stayed typically silent, and thus showing evidence that RR wasn't the quite Jesus-like politico some of his supporters make him out to be.The only other criticism I have is that on paper and in his speeches, RR came across as a classic Conservative, which is one of two reasons he is so revered by the right, what isn't provided is material that shows that while RR's voting constituency was mainly the right, RR was a President of the people that actually governed mainly from the middle. For evidence of his actual actions in office relative to this rhetoric, I recommend David Gergen's "Eyewitness to Power".
I bought this as a Christmas gift. Very nice gift. If you dont have a book that you can go to for a quick reference of the word this would be a good option.
While the mainstream keep hiring "paper champion" producers like Scott Storch and Timbaaland, as usual the real genius producers lie within the underground. Blockhead is amazing!!! These are completely dope beats that involve groove, soul, great engineering and mixing, and most importantly it's MUSICAL!! All 3 of Blockhead's CD releases are some of the best most consistent things I have ever heard. Unless you are conditioned to only like the crap that you hear on the radio and/or MTV, Blockhead will not disappoint.
These are perfect for scooping sugar into your tea or coffee (because you don't need much!) or enjoying rich desserts like a small bowl of ice cream - you get to enjoy more bites of whatever it is that you're eating!They are also perfect for setting out different sauces (mustards, small jars of whatever) and letting people serve themselves. Many times larger spoons won't fit into those.These are solid and well-made, and match my other silverware of the same pattern.
I bought this juicer before about two years ago but not from Amazon, and I never used it...one day my daughter decided that she wanted to make juice for her dad and me. SHE LOVED IT. It is easy to use and easy to clean. I bought THIS one for her as a surprise for Christmas...and I am sure she will love it since she has been using mine on an almost daily basis.
I grew up in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, the setting for Maureen Daly's novel, Seventeenth Summer, and I reread this book about five years ago when I found a new paperback edition. I'd read it about 20 years earlier as well.I think it's a lovely story, capturing what it was like to live in a small Wisconsin city during the Second World War. Sadly, the locations that Ms. Daly accurately describes have been damaged beyond repair. Lakeside Park, has since been ruined by renovations, and "Pete Mingles" swimming area among them. Lake Winnebago has been polluted for years, so you can't swim there anymore.My mother went to St. Mary's Springs High School, just like Ms. Daly, and she once took me to McKnight's Drug Store, which had its "Malt Shop" in the basement. McKnight's is now a carpet store.I haven't lived in Fond du Lac for over 30 years, and don't have the happiest memories of growing up there, but I do appreciate this book.
. . . get this book and card set! The book is attractive, short, very clear and -- most importantly -- approachable. It includes a short history on Zen, a summary of its concepts, and possible interpretations and things to think about for each koan. The koan cards will help you expand your mind, and use it in ways other than cognitively.And no peeking in the book until you've given each koan time to simmer in your mind :-)Very highly recommended whether or not you're new to Zen.
I hope that this gem of a book is reprinted soon. For all those who cannot wait, wend to the Strand bookstore on Broadway and 12th in NYC, and check out the Modern Library section; a few copies may still linger. Like its title, the book sweeps over the reader in a sort of halcyon gale of language. Read once, the book must be re-read just so that one can retrace the plot. When not totally high on language I got glimpses of two of the most vivid characters in literature -- Mr. Keith and Count Calovaglia -- and that what it was - a glimpse. Like the South Wind of the title, the book leaves the reader terribly thirsty for more -- more of the island, more of the people, more of the flora, more of the rocks, for crying out loud. It has the sense and immediacy of an impressionist painting. In the 1924 Modern Library copy I possess, Douglas has an introduction in which he enumerates the islands that inspired the locale in the book. I am still considering an island hopping vacation to the Mediterranean.
This is the first Christopher Moore novel I've read and frankly, I'm not nearly as impressed with this as many of the other reviewers. I'm not fond of tearing down other people's hard work, but this novel didn't really have much of a plot-it was more as if Moore had developed several characters he thought were funny and then sat down and tried to figure out a way to put them all in a novel. I've since read "Practical Demonkeeping" and anyone who's read it should be able to see what I'm saying-"Demonkeeping" has a plot that drives the novel and which makes the actions of the characters make sense. This novel, not so much. I thought that "Demonkeeping" was quite a bit better than this novel, and I'd recommend it above this one. I have to admit, however, that I NEVER read fiction-I haven't read a novel all the way through in years-and I DID read this one, so obviously I liked it, and it got me to go back to the library to check out another of his books. These novels certainly aren't great literature, but then if great literature were what we were after we'd be reviewing Joseph Conrad or Herman Melville. I'd advise readers to skip this novel but check out Moore's other stuff. I'm looking forward to seeing what else he's come up with.
Sink me! This is a deucedly entertaining play on the 1934 original. A heroic archeologist battling Nazis? Sounds vaguely familiar - I can't help but wonder whether George Lucas may have seen this film as a child. This is a wonderful, heartfelt wartime propaganda film.Howard strikes just the right light note as the English academic whose true calling is the rescue of politically oppressed individuals. Howard, that most English of actors, was (believe it or not) Hungarian by birth, and he delivers a stirring tribute to the values of his adopted homeland, Britain. Francis L. Sullivan (best known as Lawyer Jaggers in both the 1934 and 1945 versions of GREAT EXPECTATIONS) obviously had a great time playing this update's counterpart to the original's Chauvelin. Look for early appearances by Michael Rennie (Klaatu in THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL) and David Tomlinson (Mr. Banks in MARY POPPINS).Short of a major digital restoration, this is probably the best quality copy you will find of this film, which is a nearly sixty-year-old independent production. The master material is old, but it has been carefully cleaned and duplicated. I do wish that the soundtrack had been duplicated in Hi-Fi, but that is a minor quibble.
This Sunpak Mini-PRO Plus Table Tripod with pan head and black anodized finish was bought to replace mySunpak MINI-PLUS Mini Tripod with 3-Way Panheadof equal size mainly because of the pan handle but the anodized finish is nice, too. I gave someone else theSunpak MINI-PLUS Mini Tripod with 3-Way Panhead.
After the great &quot;Death of Superman&quot; series, this work was not up to my expectations. The artwork was sadly sub-standard and it was a very weak portrayal of Superman. I can't quite picture Superman so willingly being a doormat, even for Lois. If this were my only exposure I wouldn't come back, even with the interesting twist at the end.
As a relative newbie to the works of Debbie Macomber, i have to say, she has yet to disappoint me. With this novel, the first in her Ceder Cove series, she has made me a devoted fan for life. I literally sat down with this book, and was unable to put it down until i was finished."16 Lighthouse Rd" introduces us to some incredibly memorable characters.Olvia: Family court judge, who's torn between her feelings for the new editor of the local newspaper, and her ex.Charlotte: Olivia's mother, who goes in search of the family of a recently decesed friend.Grace: Olivia's best friend, who is dealing with a pregnant daughter, and the mysterious disappearence of her husband of 35 years.Cecilia & Ian: a young married couple who struggle to deal with their demons after the death of their newborn babyJustine, Seth & Warren: an unusual love triangle, that will definitely have you rooting for her to make the right choice.There are many more wonderful characters here, and their interweaving storylines mesh perfectly together. All i can say is that with the Ceder Cove series, Macomber has created a wonderful family that i can't wait to visit and spend time with again.
There is nothing much to say about Bob Dylan. If Amazon had a 10 star rating. then I would give it some thought! Buy it!
It's great to have The Bells on CD - even if the original master has been lost for years and the CD was made from a vinyl source. (So I conclude from the liner notes to Reed's anthology &quot;Between Thought and Expression.&quot;) The LP was one I'd always find in the bargain / cutout bins in record shops and before I finally splurged on it (spending about $3) I presumed that The Bells was a &quot;bad album.&quot; Actually it has some of Reed's most consistently interesting and funny lyrics - and the music is dominated by freestyle horns and droning synthesizers, sounding like &quot;technojazz.&quot; The combination of this weird, madly repetitive music and Reed's shaky, off-tune vocals, babbling brilliant one-liners about little sisters and rich unpleasant daddies is just unforgettable. Reed sobered up a couple years after this album came out; The Bells is a very listenable testament to those days of excess and commercial indifference. Highly recommended.
I am a profesional musician and have ears like a donkey. I have all kinds of head phones. Etymotic makes great products. However, there are problems. These are a little like have sticks hanging out of your ears. Because of this they tend to move around in your ear canal even with the larger foam ear bud. The other problem with Etymotic's is that unless you have the foam very tightly crammed into your ear, the base response is very weak. I need to again order their biggest ear foam attachments as they were not included with the earphones when shipped. I like their clarity and lack of an EQ bump which is so common in earphones, so you hear the music as it was intended, which I really like. That said, I wish they were shorter and were easier to fit in the ear every time you use them as you have to roll up the foam ear tip and then stuff it in your ear and wait for it to expand much like an ear plug for sleeping. Would I buy again. Maybe. Not happy with the lack of bass, the long stick protruding out of my ear, and the small ear tips shipped with the product. That said, most everything else is junk and I would not consider buying at all. So even with it's problems, if great sound is worth the extra hassel, these are the earphone for you.
This is much less painful than Emjoi gold cordless. And much cheaper too.I'm not repeating how good this is and worth for the price, but just wanted to give a few tips not mentined in the product manual. For small red bumps, just use aloe vera gel (pure is better.. such as Fruit of the Earth Aloe Vera 100% Gel) or any good lotion (such as Neutrogena bump minizing lotion with SPF 15), and the next day, those bumps are gone.And this is "personal care" item, i.e. for yourself only. One time, my aunt used my shaving item without letting me know and I didn't know that until I got read bumps with white heads. If you love your skin, especially you've sensitive skin, keep all your personal care items for yourself.
This is as much a lyrical story telling about the process and art of herpetoculture and herpetology as it is an informative book. The book details the experinces of the author in certain endevours (searching for a tiger rattlesnake, his first non-local snake etc.) in an entertaining readable manner. It's almost like a more intellectual, pre TV version of some of the Animal Planet reptile shows--that's the best analogy I can come up with. It's really more entertainment than information, although some info is provided (although the captive care information is out of date).This book has a very select audience; non-herpers won't likely enjoy it and shouldn't bother. For those of us who are, well, it's a great read. We'll recognize ourselves in it (at least I did) in parts. The literate writing, the intelligent allusions and comments, all made for a very interesting and captivating first hand account of what are now the good old days of herpetoculture. If you are a serious herper, you owe it to yourself to read this book.
Jez, I don't know how any consumer could look at the track listing and think this was a new EBTG album?? Go figure. Anyway this is a brillant, sensitive compilation but together by none other than the brillant and sensitive duo, Everything But The Girl. The chill starts and never stops. The only track that slightly upsets the mix is The Roots &quot;Silent Treatment&quot;--but in itself is great, just a little heavy on the uptempo for the rest of the mix. Favorites are Model 500 &quot;The Flow&quot;, Beth Orton &quot;The Stars all Seem to Weep (destined to become a classic), and the spine tingling track contributed by Mary Margaret O'Hara &quot;To Cry About&quot; (Whatever happended to her??). The thought put into this compliation is evident after the fist listen, the mixing is seamless. Get this! Summer has offically begun.
How much of this is as real about the Queen? She has always been so dedicated and stoic. This movie made me think of her in a different light--from her side of it all.Helen Mirren---was the BEST---I love everything she does.She nailed this one!
Corelle dishes came highly recommend by several friends. They are very affordable so I decided to go for it. I am very impressed so far. I have already dropped several (I am clumsy!) and they are holding up great. I like that they are lightweight and don't take up a ton of space in my cupboard. It's also nice that the corners have rounded edges. I really like this pink set because it's classy and pretty.
While I prefer "The Way We Were" more, "Funny Girl" and it's sequel, "Funny Lady", are still pure musical fun with none other but the legendary Barbra Streisand. Barbra Streisand plays 1910s Broadway sensation Fanny Brice. These two movies practically chronicle her life as one of the Ziegfeld follies all the way to being a Broadway superstar. If you're a fan of these movies, then I suggest you should get this 2-movie pack, which will most likely be cheaper than getting the movies separately."Funny Girl" (1968) is two and a half hours of comedy, music, and drama. It chronicles Fanny Brice as one of the Ziegfeld follies, meeting and later on marrying Nick Arnstein (Omar Sharif), where they have a child named Frances. The first hour of the movie is fun to watch, where Barbra is a "funny girl", and about an hour and a half later, the film gets more more serious all the way to it's dramatic ending, where Barbra sings "My Man". A few other musical highlighs include "I'm the Greatest Star", "People" (her hit song), and "Don't Rain on My Parade". All together, "Funny Girl" is worth repeated viewings. It's a great Oscar-winning musical production."Funny Lady" (1975) is two hours of more comedy, music, and drama, and while it's not as good as the original, I still really like it. It picks up right where "Funny Girl" left off. It starts off dramatic, with Barbra still shaky over the divorce, and later on, she meets songwriter Billy Rose (James Caan), and he marries her even though they don't quite love each other. It turns from dramatic to funny to dramatic again. The thing about this film is that, unlike the first film, this one actually made me laugh. It was pretty funny, and it had good songs too, including "How Lucky Can You Get?", "Let's Hear it For Me", and "I Found a Million Dollar Baby". "Funny Lady" isn't absolutely amazing, but it's still a very good movie.Barbra Streisand has a career that's been going on for a half a century, and these movies showcase her extreme musical talent, and both are very good movies that deserve to be seen.
Bad acting, a terrible plot, and reality stretched to the brink make this movie a terrible choice for anyone that DOES NOT play roleplaying games. If you do like RPGs, rent this movie with your friends and watch it - you'll laugh yourselves silly, especially at the ending!
For someone like me without no expert knowledge but a continued interest in the history behind religious legend, this is a great book for beginning to learn the historical roots of Judaism and ancient Israel. The book is about how scholars and archeologists are interacting more to puzzle out how Israel and the Jewish identity arose. What fascinates me about this book is the strong suggestion that the Exodus was not a major historical event in the history of the Jewish people and probably not when and where their religion was principally shaped, though it became a main event in their religious mythology a number or centuries later. Maybe this kind of thing inevitably happens longterm in the literature of all religious (and nationalistic) traditions: Good story wins over literal truth. I'm eager to read the next good summary of work in this field by researchers from Israel and elsewhere. And I admire their patience in sorting things out!
I loved this camera at first and have only had it 6 months. Great pictures, so easy to use, nice video feature, etc. But here it is 6 months later, it's jammed, frozen, won't work and it's the holidays. I have to send it in to be fixed with no clue when I'll get it back. I've baby'd this thing and am never rough on it nor have gotten it moist, wet, anything. NOT IMPRESSED!
The story was fantastic I liked the first book of the series, but it is a very hard read when the, they, them, or a, am, an are mixed up in the writing of the story. At times I would have to read a sentence 2 or 3 times to get the point. I do hope there is a rewrite of this book in the future it has a good story.
I've bought several bulk paper towels, and have found these are my family's favorite.The other rolls would go SO quickly, and not absorb that much. These are very soft (easy to wipe my infant son's face!) and work GREAT on windows and counters. I find I need only one paper towel instead of several of the "papery" ones.
Owned this scope for 2 seasons. Mounted on my RRA AR15. I was initially please with this scope. Made in Korea, zoomed smoothly, versatile, stayed tight on the mounts and consistently accurate. After putting about 500rds through it I was amazed that the crosshairs fell apart. That's right. The crosshairs literally fell apart. The lens were fine, scope was never dropped or abused. Looking through the lens the crosshairs simply scattered. Weird. I liked the scope I paid $79.99 retail, and it appeared to be top quality. It held up well. I guess too many rounds went through it. Pretty disastrous failure if your'e hunting for food. Maybe pay more and get something rated for more use.
Carol Burnett has long been a favorite entertainer. Few people realize that she also has a marvelous singing voice. This release showcases her wide vocal range and acting ability. This lady can really sell a song. As a singer myself and member of the Munzer-Patterson Vocal Duo, I can tell you that vocally, musically, and emotionally, the performances on this disc were truly entertaining.
I have five CD on the singings(songs) of Auvergne - In my opinion Anna Moffo is the best interpreter What a pity! that she(it) offers us only 7 singings(songs) - Kiri Te Kanawa offers us 2 CD deserved well of these very beautiful singings(songs) which awaken our senses has the nature - Christian (France)
I bought the biggest size available and I wasn't expecting this thing to be this huge. Every morning it's like I'm grabbing a gallon of chrome to spray it on me. I used this cologne before, this is a great one. It leaves a trail behind and because I'm hot and gorgeous, I'm just having to take a bigger effort to ignore chicks (I'm faithfully married to a jealous cubana)Oh, I also use this on me after going to the gym or heavily sweating from running if I don't wanna shower. Yeah, it's pretty disgusting but I bet I end up smelling better than you after you shower.
I don't have this TV but the company itself is horrible. A DVD recorder that is only 2 years old broke (disk tray won't open) and I emailed Go Video for help since it was impossible to get them by phone. Here is the response email I got and I quote: "Go Video no longer offers tech support or customer service." Need I say more?
I wont delve too much into the book much as so many reviewers have dealt with that quite well. Also, Im not going to discuss MacDonald's guilt or innocence much. Lets just say I find the book well written and believe MacDonald is guilty.Now that thats done, let me give you an interesting angle to the novel. I first picked up the book when I was in the Army. I enjoyed the beginning up to MacDonald leaving the Army and the final chapters after he was found guilty. The middle portion was not quite to my liking then.Fast forward a few years later and Im in law school taking the required evidence course. This class can be a bit dry and complicated. While delving into the minutia of how courts pick what evidence can be considered, I pick up Fatal Vision again. Wonder of wonders, that middle part I didnt like is chock full of evidence issues! Now while Im sure some will argue the Judge in this case incorrectly used the evidence rules, the analysis used in such matters is there and its applied to a truly interesting subject. Thanks Joe, you helped me ace Evidence! For that Im truly in your debt.
I had a pair of these box handler gloves. They are designed to give you grip on slippery surfaces such as box sides. These started to delaminate and shred after maybe a dozen occasions. For the money that's pretty bad. I would suggest you buy something like theseGlovePro Black Magic Glovesas their price is more in line with short term disposable. I love the concept, just not the execution by Youngstown.
LITTLE LIT, the brainchild of comics master Art Spiegelman, was created to fill a void in comics: There is nothing out there anymore for kids. He looked around himself and saw talent brimming over the surface, but no one creating for the people who made comics popular in the first place. On the back, it says, &quot;COMICS -- They're not just for grown-ups anymore!&quot; The oversize hardcover is a collection of seventeen artists -- some comics creators, some illustrators, some children's book authors -- for this book of fairy tales. Let me say straight out that the art is downright beautiful. Gorgeous. Breathtaking. However, with the exception of one Japanese folk tale, there is absolutely no diversity: All white, and mostly male. There is no excuse for that. Beyond that, however, most of this book is solid gold.Firstly, it's designed by Chip &quot;BATMAN: ANIMATED&quot; Kidd. He is, quite simply, the best graphic designer in the business. In this volume, he strikes the perfect balance between old-fashioned and avant-garde design. And the covers (no dust jacket -- just the leather hardcover) are by Art Spiegelman. The paper is thick and matte. The only problem here is that the book seems a little fragile, like the pages will come out at the slightest provocation. But I could be wrong about that.&quot;Prince Rooster&quot; (Spiegelman), &quot;The Leafless Tree&quot; (Joost Swarte), &quot;The Two Hunchbacks&quot; (Lorenzo Mattotti), &quot;The Baker's Daughter&quot; (Harry Bliss), and &quot;The Princess and the Pea&quot; are all lushly drawn, fairly simple fairy tales. &quot;Humpty Trouble&quot; (William Joyce) and &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; (David Macaulay) are light satires. &quot;The Hungry Horse&quot; (Kaz) is a wonderful story, my favorite *story* of the batch, but &quot;The Fisherman and the Sea Princess&quot; (David Mazzuchelli), the Japanese folk tale is my favorite overall. The only story here that I don't like is &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; (the ending that nobody knows) by Daniel Clowes, because he can't draw people who look good or smile or anything that you need in a fairy tale. Also thrown in is a lost Walt Kelly cartoon, &quot;The Gingerbread Man,&quot; originally from FAIRY TALE PARADE (?!) in the 40's. Shorter features are a memory game, a laugh-out-loud &quot;What's Wrong With This Picture,&quot; find the twins, and Spookyland (Charles Burns), which is absolutely terrifying -- I think it's too scary for little kids myself. In the front and back is FAIRY TALE ROAD RAGE (Chris Ware), a game with little cars to assemble and chits to punch out and instructions to read. Essentially, you move around the board and create a story by picking random chits and putting them in the appropriate places on your card. When it fills up, you read the story and make up a moral. It's a lot of fun. And the pictures and instructions are absolutely hilarious.All in all, this book is highly recommended for small children of any age! :)E-mail if you would like to discuss (kobyc@softhome.net) ...... -Koby.
Provided at least a few good hours of entertainment for an elementary school aged boy. He didn't seem to experience much difficulty following the directions to make the different models.
People, DO NOT LISTEN TO THE CRITICS!!!!!!! I just got back from seeing Poseidon, and it was awesome. You couldn't ask for more action in a film than this. Every second is filled with action, suspense, and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.As for people complaining about bad acting, bad plot, etc, I'm just wondering if they saw this same movie I did or just making crap up. The acting was top notch in here. Overall, the entire cast gave excellent performances, but with the 2 main standouts being Kurt Russell and Josh Lucas. They were perfect for the roles they played in this type of movie. Whoever did the casting, I give you credit. You really know how to pick your people. Oh, and Richard Dreyfuss is getting really old yes, but he shows he can still do some heavy action stuff. And as for the plot, yes, there is one. A big giant wave crashes into a big ship, people are hurt and killed, and a few try to find a way to escape, and they do. There you go. And what did you want, another Titanic, which runs about 3 hours long. Heck no, I would think not. This movie runs a good short 98 minutes, so you can't really complain about that. The movie does not drag on, and gets to the action right away.So all in all, I highly recommend this action masterpiece to everyone who enjoys an awesome action movie filled with stunning visual effects and scenery. You can really tell that the 140 million budget for this film was used all the way and was not a waste. Great acting, great visual effects, great cast, great plot, overall GREAT! Go see. You will not be disappointed!! :)
I saw the movie first, which was pretty good but a bit too depressing. 15 minutes into the movie, I knew I would buy the soundtrack even though I could only pick up bit and pieces of the music from the background during the film. When I finally got the CD, it blowed my mind away! The music can bring you to another world. Every song isdifferent, yet the theme is very consistent. I love it! It's great to listen to while you paint.
The premise of this book is that the Cat in the Hat is our tour guide to the rainforest and he shows us birds, animals and plants that live there. There are astounding things to learn but I don't think having the Cat rhyme about them conveys the amazing REAL world of the rainforest. Shouldn't the astounding world of the rainforest be enough to recommend itself? This book also doesn't honor Dr. Seuss. Why is somebody trying to copy what essentially can't be copied?: the inventive, outlandish ((and note: OUT of this world and NOT of this world)) characters and word play. I don't like the mix of Seuss' world and the facts of the real world. What next? Will Sponge Bob introduce me to what it is like to go to the dentist? Will Garfield teach us all how to vote? Why have the images and concepts of Dr. Seuss been co-opted?It is right to want to defend the rainforest but our children are supposed to care because a fantasy character wishes them to? I think children have a sense for these things and find the GENUINELY OUTLANDISH to be delightful -- and find the REAL FACTS of the world without garnishment to be fascinating.
I first heard of this film via the excellent soundtrack and the fact that it was based on an amusement park I used to go to as a child on Long Island. I really wanted to love this film but I thought it was just okay at best - it fell below average as both a comedy and a drama. And by the time the compromise was met the film was over.As much as is not really the most important thing for a film to have characters that are relate-able or likable or not...these characters were simply pretty hard to care about.Romantic inexperience or not the James character was just kind of stupid with deep insecurity issues and turned out to be a verbally-abusive jerk to boot (this didn't add depth to the character so much as maker him easy to dislike). Just because someone isn't a man-of-the-world with women doesn't automatically mean that they are completely insensitive and unlikable fools. This kind of deflated things just a bit, and no, by making him unlikable they didn't make things any more realistic. The characters in this film were all somewhat on the self-centered side of things, which made me feel as though it was an adult's version of a teenager (oh, of course the teenage Kristen Stewart character is having an affair with the married Ryan Reynolds character) and somewhat inauthentic. And the whole subplot involving antisemitism was just an unnecessary eye-roller.The DVD is fine. The special features are average. Oh well, the soundtrack is still great.
I watch this movie when I need some good &quot;mind candy&quot; entertainment. Having just come back from vacation in Jamaica, it was even more of a joy to watch. Robin Williams is (as always) great fun to watch. Peter O'Toole is classic as the disdainful British expat. Jimmy Cliff is a bonus! Don't expect anything deep, just a bit of parody and fun!
Books is an eyeopener.If you thought like on tropical island would be paradise, read this book.Story stays with you...
This was one of my favorite books as a teenager. The write ups are for basic Dungeons and Dragons but can be used for hackmaster, D20,Castles and crusades and really any fantasy game. One page has a detailed drawing by Jim Holloway of about twenty or so characters numbered, on the following pages are descriptions of the npc's and their stats. The groups are classes for basic D&D, elves, halflings, dwarves, fighters, thieves, clerics, mages, ect. In the back of the book describes an inn (The classic meeting place) and the back of the module is the tavern map perfect for minis.
Dara Joy normally writes wonderfully, and normally I thoroughly enjoy any book I read by her, but Rejar left me incredibly dissatisfied. There was neither the humor and lighthearted wit I found in Knight of a Trillion Stars nor the engaging storyline of the next book. There wasn't even the incredible bond between the two main characters; Lilac does not appreciate Rejar for who he is, nor do they seem to enjoy each other outside of the bedroom. I just didn't see any deep spiritual bond lurking anywhere in the text, except where it is said explicitly that she is His Mate. This book had such potential... At the end, I just felt sad for Rejar... But &quot;Knight...&quot; and the next book, &quot;Mine to Take&quot; (which used all the sensual potential of its Familiar hero, Gian Ren) are fantastic, and not at all formulaic, like some romance series. The only reason I would recommend reading this would be to further the plot of the series... but even there, it's not vital. Stick with the series, just skip &quot;Rejar.&quot;
This is a book that aims a lot higher than the average historical novel. The author's highly developed writing style as well as his erudition are on full display in this enormous, sprawling epic that ranges from prehistory to the 16th century in what seems to be northern Germany, through the squalors and splendors of Renaissance Rome during the papacy of Leo X Medici, to various epic sea journeys.All sorts of disparate strands are woven together, all ultimately related to the absurd contest between Spain and Portugal over which will be the first country to gratify Pope Leo's whim: to own a rhinoceros to compliment his beloved elephant. The winner will get to divide the recently discovered "New World" to his country's advantage. The story is loosely based on historical fact: Leo did want a rhino, and he set up the competition between the two world powers more for his own amusement than for any serious political purpose.Leo and his court are presented in all their vanity, corruption and obliviousness to the enormous issues facing the papacy at that time. The author is very strong on his presentation of the incredible squalor that surrounded the splendor of the papal court; his picture of Renaissance Rome is one you can smell as well as see.I liked the author's description of Leo's "silly, fun-stuffed head:" a perfect characterization of Giovanni de' Medici, who might be described as a profoundly frivolous man. This is a novel where the characters take time to urinate and defecate, fornicate and masturbate, but only one character ever bathes!Although the prose is often brilliant, it's just as often over-the-top and needlessly elaborated. A less indulgent editor could have insisted the book be trimmed by a good quarter, which would have improved it. But even in its shaggy, overgrown state, it's an impressive achievement.
Chingon crosses heavy guitars and and overall grinding sound with spanish songs to create a genre bending type I call Heavy Mariachi. Any songs with Rodriquez's sister, Patricia Vonne, are top notch and Tito Larrivia adds the edge that he brings to his previous work. While Los Lobos strives for diversity, it's my hope that Chingon stays the course. To best describe this band, combine Los Lobos, the Sadies and Grunge and you'll have a good idea. I look forward to what they can do with some additional original compositions, but well selected and composed covers will be exciting nonetheless.
I play keyboard for small audiences from time-to-time and needed something easier to use than my old Shur mic. This unit does everything I need. I usually run it through a pre-amp but I've also hooked it straight into my keyboard's auxiliary audio input. The pre-amp probably helps clean up the sound a little bit. I keep the boom to the side of my mouth so that it's not picking up breathing sounds...I have to speak up a little because of that but it's a small trade-off. I don't really sing so I can't comment on the mic from that respect. Basically, I have no complaints and recommend it.
This was so boring I couldn't finish it. I normally like murder books but this one was too... Preachy? I don't know. I wish he would have just told the story instead of trying to juxtapose Holmes' actions against the worlds fair.
I found many faults with this book, beginning with the first of my observations. It lacked any romance!!! Yes, the book contained some intrique and danger but lacked the romance, the wit, the strong confident hero and the headstrong willful heroine. Neither the hero or heroine were particularly likeable characters and the plot and the 'secret' were unbelievable. I may have found enjoyment reading about the hero if he had been raised in the West, particularly North America, for his language usage was that of an American and not of a European. But I found him a slimy worm of a hero and found no reason why she, the princess, should open her arms to him in the end.
I began this book with an open mind and before I was finished I had concluded Gary was either making it all up or he had been visted by beings from the darker side of the universe. There is simply too much gobble-dy-gook for any grounded, sane person to take this seriously. First his "guides" appear as hipsters speaking and dressing in the now claiming there is no male or female in the afterlife, that God is static and that nothing moves forward or progresses in the universe. The truth is the exact opposite from that. God's universes are forever expanding and so will we under certain conditions. There is enough sugary 'truth' blended in with the many false doctrines here (which the 'father of all lies' does so well-he gives us 99 truths to lead astray with the one big falsehood.) to make the unaware want to believe this nonsense. Example: According to these guides the best way to describe what it is like in heaven is that it's like a perfect sexual orgasm that never ends. I've seen writers try and put spiritual experiences in the vernacular before but I was looking around for the lightning bolt when I read that one-after, of course, I had stopped laughing. Or, their explanation of the second commandment,you know, the one about graven images. "...the real meaning is that you shouldn't make up any images of God because God has no image." Aren't we created in the "image of God"?I understand so many are seeking for meaning in their lives. That's part of being human. I would suggest they look elsewhere for their answers. My gut feeling on this work is that Gary's only 'experience' was to make a buck. If that be the case then it is worse than I thought. Ye seekers, keep seeking because this ain't it!
Von Frickle rocks!! The music on this CD abounds with odd time signatures, multiple changes in tempo and dynamics (from a speed-metal type groove to a softer jazzy song to electronic noise with tape loops), angular guitar chords, classic Moog and Farfisa synths, and much instrumental virtuosity.Take a liberal dose of King Crimson, mix in some Ozric Tentacles, add one heaping tablespoon of Krautrock, sprinkle with a smidgen of surf music (not to mention some decidedly un-bluesy slide guitar work), and you have one of the most interesting instrumental progressive rock bands of the new millenium. These guys have chops to burn, and consequently Von Frickle smokes on this release.In a world where there are many 'new' progressive artists attempting to re-hash old prog-rock cliches, Von Frickle carves out a niche of their own, not being afraid to wear their influences on their sleeves at the same time.
I have recently read a bunch of the 40something rock bios (don't ask me why, maybe its because I'm a boring 35yr old father of three). For what its worth, they wereOzzy - very funny, great down to earth British humorHammer of the Gods - OK, but a bit disappointing given the hype surrounding this bookMy Life, Keith Richards - actually very good, he remembers it all!Slash by Slash - a friend gave my this. Not bad, a little too many drugs methinksMy Appetite - Steven Adler. Friend's copy. Rather sad book.Walk This Way by Aerosmith, The Dirt by Motley Crue. These two are the best of the lot, because they are written by members of the band and entourage, so we get many different stories, and the same stories written from different perspectives. If I remember way back to English lit teachers rambling on about unreliable narrators and all that, these books are very interesting in a kind of post-modern way (or something like that, jeez) in that there is no one single narrator. Ya, OK.Lemmy by Lemmny - the book I'm supposed to be reviewing. Very funny at first, but the tale is a little light, especially when told by one guy. Found myself skimming near the end. For what its worth would have liked Motorhead to have written a book, call it Spades of Aces.Anthony Kleidis book - front man of the Red Hot Chilli Peppers. I hated this. Perhaps I was burnt out reading about the rock scene, but for me this guy is just a narcissitic moron with no sense of humor.The Heroin Diaries, Nikki Sixx. Fair enough, but The Dirt is much better.
Yeah, normally, when you say that its followed with a "....you wont believe what happens" Not the case, what I liked about the end, was the excellent rock playing as the credits rolled, AND the fact that the movie was done. I absolutely hated this movie. I felt like it had a cast filled with supporting actors, no heavy hitters anchoring it down. Now, this movie is compared with ID4, Alien, War of the Worlds, whatever...NO WAY... ID4 has real heart, characters you care about, they have an affect on the outcome. Alien is cinematic classic, this doesnt even come close to touching Alien...so forget that comparison! Lastly, War of the Worlds, brilliant, beautiful, scary and like nothing I'd seen, this movie doesnt touch IT either. Skyline largely follows in the footsteps are larger more successful sci fi movies, and gives you nothing new. Do yourself a favor, dont substitute the originals. You'll be happier watching the ones that came first.
Alice is one of those rare albums that was amazing right off the bat, and is still just as phenomenal after dozens (hundreds!) of listens. Waits might be an acquired taste for some, but this is one of those rare albums where everything --vocals, percussion, strings-- conspires to create an utterly poetic experience.
An interesting perspective on white privilege and striving to connect with people of other cultures and ethnicities. I found it personally valuable and thought-provoking.
Best book I have read in my life without a close 2nd..not even The Fountainhead.
This book caught my eye because it somwhat delves into the Chasidic communities of L.A and New York. The book was a fast moving,light read. I did find myself compelled to read on to find out who killed the young Chasidic babysitter. My only complaint is I agree some other reviewers, most of it was unbelievable ( all the characters were SO willing to help our sleuth out, all detectives should be so lucky) and the ending left me thinking it even more unrealistic. But I guess sometimes unrealistic things can happen in real life too. Too much of it just feel into place too easily, it got rather hokey. But all in all I would have to say its worth my rating.

This is a nice Genesis overview. It doesn't have other languages subtitles as the European version but is still a must for Genesis fans. It has quotations from all members (Peter Gabriel, Anthony Phillips, Tony Banks, Mike Rutherford, Steve Hackett, John Silver, Daryl Stuermer, Bill Bruford and Chester Thompson). As a plus it contain acoustic versions (some complete some not) of known songs.
I have one for the car, and it works great. Multiple inserts will fit most configurations. Easy to get iPod in or out. Easily adjustable in all dimension, angles.Just got this second one for our exercise equipment, which has a cup holder :-)
I used to be a Reich fan before I read this book.It's a page-turner, alright: you keep reading hoping it will get better and stop being irritating.If you like "3 Days of the Condor"-type insider conspiracies and think there's a secret cabal like the Bilderberger committee plotting to take over this country and/or plan on voting for Hillary for President, this book is for you.(It features a "Senator" woman becoming President who "likes to wear black pantsuits.")The plot is so contrived, it's pathetic.I can hardly believe this is the same author that wrote Israeli espionage tales that I thought were interesting.
This documentary contains the infamous FLIR allegations that claim Federal Agents massacred Davidians as they tried to exit the compound. However, with the work of expert Ian William Goddard and the Maryland Advanced Development Laboratory (among others) conclusively showed that the FLIR &quot;gunshots&quot; were actually reflections of the thermal exhaust of the tank. This, along with the coroner reports (in public domain) of the Davidians show that they all died behind a brick wall with single shots to the head. This was ruled as suicide, seeing as how it would be impossible for Federal agents to fire through a brick wall and hit each of them in the head without missing a single shot.Thus, this documentary is slander against the US government and lies about the tragic fate of the Branch Davidians.
This kit has everything you need to install custom F connectors onto the end of coax cables. The cable stripper (solid blue plastic v-shaped item on the far right of the image) is the only item that felt a little cheap, but it does the job perfectly every time and has two distinct channels for stripping just the outer jacket and all the way down to the copper core of the coax. Not sure why other reviewers had trouble, this kit worked perfectly for me.
It's not only that "The Wire" is great TV. It's that season two doesn't let you down. Take for example "24 Hours". I saw season one, practically straight through, five hours at the time. It was quick, it was intense, it was original. Season two was not fresh. The same issues seem to appear again. I am ready for any leap of faith, the guy shoots from 50 meters, kills three people, but please, please give me a plot that I can believe in.But back to "The Wire".I went to the series after suffering withdrawal symptoms finishing "Sopranos", "Deadwood", "NYPD Blue" (these guys stopped at season two and never cared to proceed) and "The Shield". I went through season one and thanked God for having enough faith on HBO to buy two seasons of the show together. I am half-way through finishing season two and I am already convinced that this is not going to let me down. Once again, I enjoy TV with a plot thick enough to get me interested but not to get lost. I like characters that have something different, but no so much that I find them odd. I enjoy a story with a moral center, but not a morality lesson.Season one was centered in a Baltimore "ghetto". Season two expands into the Baltimore port. There are new characters added to the old ones, and yet you get comfortable with the new plot almost immediately. The production has spend money for the extra shot in an outside location in the middle of the night, just have two characters saying two lines, just to shed a light into what the characters think. It's the attention to detail that makes a good show great. And it's the superb casting, and the talent of writing.As a consumer many times I felt cheated off my money after buying a product that turned out to be less than what it promised. In the case of "The Wire", as with "Deadwood" (HBO) the "The Sopranos" (HBO) and "The Shield" (Fox) I feel that I would have happily paid more. If you haven't bought season 1, go ahead buy season 1 and 2 together. You would wish that there was season 3 out there.
I didnt like this book at all if I compare the other books that Clive Cussler has written. It is a lack of adventure.I can easily say that this is Clive Cussler's worst book
I've enjoyed reading this book. It effectively shows you how to write a very basic first person shooter in directx. Well done. It briefly introduces rendering, a simple scripting system, peer-to-peer networking, handling user input, scene management, collision detection, sound effects, and more. Not bad. The code is fine, I had no problems compiling it in VS2005 (check the authors website for the latest code though) and I learned a lot from reading the book and going through the code. In short, I am glad to have bought and read this book and I do recommend it to others.The book does have some drawbacks though. I feel that the actual game that is built in this book is embarrasingly bad. The networking system, rendering system, user interface, and everything else about it are bare-bones functional, but certainly not good enough that you'd want to encorporate them into your own game. I suppose that the thought is that you should first learn to build a Yugo before you learn to build a Ferrari, but personally I'd rather just learn to build the ferrari right off the bat :) Oh, and why must the graphics suck so badly? I realize that it doesn't necessarily impact the goal of learning the various topics, but seriously, how hard would it have been to at least provide a decent character model, or some decent textures and lighting and so forth?One last thing. The book assumes a familiarity with C++ and to a lesser extent with Directx, so if you are brand new to either of those, the book will be pretty challenging to follow.
The graphics are really good, and the effects, like the slow motion effect, are great. The AI is pretty good as well. And there is some humor in it. Like when you meet the first girl, you have to escort her out the building, and she keeps making sarcastic remarks like "Do you HAVE to kill EVERYONE?!?" I thought it was pretty funny.Now for the bad parts of the game. I think the thing I hate most is that your character cant run fast. In other words, he can never sprint. When he walks, he walks extremely slow, and it's not a video card problem. And when you toggle on run mode, he only walks a little faster. He is certainly not capable of running fast at all. His slow movement, combined with very repetitious mazes of office buildings makes it a bit boring.Other than the fact that most of the maps are repetitive, and your character can't run fast, ever, I give it 4 stars. I only have to knock of stars because they made it so repetitive. But there are enough points in the game (although not often enough) where the action is absolutely entertaining.
The Edition 9 has taken a cue from Bose, attempting to justify its inflated price tag by calling it "The World's Most Expensive Headphone." You'll find more pleasing ways to power your iPod elsewhere. Moreover, it is strongly recommended to sample competing models to decide which "sound" is best for you. While the Edition 9 performs well, it may in someways fall short of perfection. (And in all accuracy, the Edition 9 is half the cost of its limited Edition 7; it's already contradicting its own ad copy before it's even out of the gate.- The case is astonishing, offering full production in an aluminum-lined enclosure almost worthy of protection in itself. The problem is that, with daily use, a case like this is likely to be stored in a closet. And protection may be a long-term an issue; while most listeners are satisfied, a few have complained about flaking the outer surface flaking. Since these phones are presumably going to be used for a long time, wear is a potential issue. The other "problem" is the Edition 9's ability to be folded away like the Sony V6; but it does not fold into its portable carrying case, rendering the case rather useless.- The are made of Ethiopian sheep leather, an exclusive material offers good softness and long the ability to listen with better-than-average ease.- The Edition 9 has a forgiving sound with a prominent bass (thanks to its closed design). The treble is more delicate and clear, but probably not ideal for those who crave detail.- A great-sounding headphone is worth the price. However, a superior collector's phone like the Grado HP2 can be acquired for less than the price of an Edition 9, and perfectionists (with a larger sound system) may favor the exceptional detail of the AKG K1000 - which, with the right set-up, may be the best dynamic phone out there. Even current phones from Audio-Technica may surprise. Before falling for Edition 9 ad copy, do a lot of listening.Can a headphone be "the best?" Only your ad copy knows for sure. But anyone who paid $3000 for the Edition 7 probably isn't counting pennies, either.
If you want to learn modeling in teh IT/IS industry, you would be better served by going to another source. Rational is the &quot;King&quot; of UML modeling and their products are much better than this.Further, if you want support for more database platforms than only DB2, Oracle, or MS SQL then you will want to use a different tool. Try learning data modeling using tools from Computer Associates or Embarcadero before going anywhere near this horribly over-rated software.
I was very disappointed with this book. I found the writing to be dry and bordering on judgmental in many instances. It's as if he cannot help but view the country and its people through a filter; a filter in which everything "foreign" is suspect, sinister or stupid. He occasionally is able to move beyond that mindset and provide small, insightful, glimpses into the people and customs of the country, but those moments are far too brief in comparison with the overall body of the work. I would not recommend this book unless you are simply out of other reading material.
This book gives new meaning to the words, &quot;dirt bag.&quot; The predator is a artifically created swarm of robotic dust. The author doesn't seem to appreciate the difference in words like evolution and mutation. His whole world is evolving and his story very nearly unravels. It is just a bit too preposterous to swallow even if the author does believe it possible. It doesn't hold together as well as his swarm. Too bad. Save your money.
This is my second HOT-1. They just do not last - each less than a year. I am not going to make the same mistake again.
In a "Blade Runner" like future, four vigilante women - the Knight Sabers - assist the AD Police in fighting boomers, living machines not unlike the Replicants from "Blade Runner". The Knight Saber ring leader is Sylia Stingray, a rich, mysterious brunette who is the daughter of the man who created the boomers and whom might actually be a boomer herself. The others include rebellious biker girl Priss Asagiri, aerobics instructor Linna Yamazki and ADP computer hacker Nene. Other characters include ADP man Leon McNichol, a Brad Pitt like pretty boy with high ideals and a jerky attitude as well as a thing for Priss and with Leon is his hilarious partner Daley Wong. Oh and Sylia has a pervert whiz kid for a brother by name of Mackey. The villains include Quincy, chairman of GENOM, the company that produces the boomers, his right hand man Brian J. Mason (killed off too soon) and an obnoxious boomer man named Largo.A good series overall, but being dated is the least of its problems. Originally slated for 13 episodes, it was cut short at episode 8, leaving many series plot threads unresolved. A sequel series, Bubblegum Crash, was concocted to solve this problem but it didn't help. Also the characters are never as well developed as you would like them to be. The most interesting character, the Knight Saber ringleader Sylia, is never completely explored. Linna had potential, but her subplot involving a friend who was apart of a mafia family was never resolved and most of the time Linna was just ignored. Nene was cute and funny but only had one episode to call her own, the last one. Sadly, most of the series attention was centered on Priss, who somehow became the most popular character of the series, so much in fact that although she was originally suppose to die, a fan backlash saved her; I think this was due partly to the fact that she was voiced by a then popular Japanese singer. But Priss herself was not that interesting of a character: all her episodes basically revolve around her seeking revenge for a minor character friend that we the audience sometimes didn't even get to know in depth. Priss became repetitive and dull after a certain point. I could never quite figure out what Leon saw in her.But the series itself is not inherently bad. Animation is still pretty good in most of the eps (excluding the first one, which is a bit herky jerky, and the last one, in which the characters are drawn much too thinly), was generally good natured, good humored, and it had an interesting theme on humanity VS technology.Remade for TV as "Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040" in 1999. Hate to say it, but 2040 was superior in many ways, though not completely perfect in and of itself.
Obsessed takes a little longer for the action to really set off, but is nonetheless action packed. First of all, this is a great book, especially for those interested in the Nazi concentration camps and the suffering that the Jews went through during that time. You will literally be able to see the death camps and hear the screams... It also features two of the purestly evil antagonists I've ever read about. The hatred that Roth Braun feels for just about everyone he encounters becomes so real that it's chilling.On the downside, the plot is a bit fantastic in spots, with characters deciding and doing things that seem unlikely. Also, I would've liked to see the latter 1/4 of the book a little more fleshed out. The ending is certainly exciting, but doesn't have the knock-out blow that THR3E possessed.But, in conclusion, it's Ted Dekker. Which means that it's most definitely going to be good. Buy this book.
Can an owner let me know if this double pack has Spanish subtitles?Thanks in advance.UPDATE: No Spanish subtitles in the whole series from season 1 to 5.But apart of it, you will like the show with 5 stars.
One of the latest in the G series has some connections to past mostly around Godzilla attacks. It has a great story lots of ideas and fun characters BUT the effects wildly range from good to AWFUL! What happened!? If you compare the effects in this movie to G Vs. Meccha G the effects in that movie blow this one out of the water. There are wires on Magagurius!? Its 2004 people! EVEN THE 1964 FILMS had better effects than that. And Godzilla himself.. he's lifeless and dull. His face and movements are terrible.. no no. If you are going to spend all this money and time do it right!!!! But for story and characters and the odd good effects and there are a few I gave this movie probably more stars than it deserves.
I bought this book thinking that it would be a lot of laughs, it wasn't. It was however, a good story. It was a bit far fetched at times, but I found myself rooting for Jenny and her friends.Each chapter in the book being told from a different character's view point added to the flow of the story. A good beach read.
Saw her on TV and bought CD on a chance she was good.Wrong, she is great!!!
i thought i didn't like it because-it didn't layer beats and arrangements as lusciously as Post and Homogenic.-bjork's voice is so quiet and whispery and ... not there...bjork's voice SHOULD be the centrepiece of the album but without the vibrancy and excitement and energy that she's known for, bjork sounds just like anyone else. this "quiet ecstacy" just does not compliment bjork's vocal style very well.but most of all i don't like it because the ideas aren't there....'Isobel' was about a mythic figure who realises the stones are growing into skyscrapers, so she sends moths to the thinking people to make them be more instinctual.the lyrics to vespertine are childish, simplistic, there's no depth, they're like a 16 year olds diary of poetry.the melodies are too drawn out and slow. they're hardly catchy or memorable.the arrangements are sparse and over-simplified. they merely rehash ideas i've heard in other more avante garde records, such as the sound of a record needle skipping the groove.but the arrangements are the reason i give this album its one star. i think if you took bjork's lyrics and boring vocals off. you'd have an ok album.i'll probably sell this album.
Got this for my 50mm as protection. Its well constructed and no issues with image quality. I was a little concerned with the thickness, but no vignetting with my lens. Get one!!!update (July 2010). Am disappointed with this filter. After some use I have noticed that the glass does not seem to be clean no matter what I do. Used all sorts of cleaners etc but no effect. Have been leaving it on instead of a lens cap, but I take it off before shooting. Have recently acquired a Nikon NC filter that is head and shoulders above this...and well worth the price. Lesson learned. Will not make this mistake again!!!
It is totally unacceptable that many recordings here starts abruptly missing a few seconds of the beginning of the songs like cut from the original 12" records and I don't mean that is edited to a shorter version. it sounds like at the moment of the recording process, everyone involved was drunk and totally distracted from what they were doing, like they did not care a thing about what they were doing, since they did not even check the final product before releasing it. Only 2 songs are saved from this disaster, and if it wasn't because I always liked this 2 tracks I would give -5 to 0 stars to this chaos of production. My favorite track, that I wanted so bad on CD was Jump Back by Dhar Braxton, and it misses like 20 to 30 seconds of the original beginning, like when you play a 12 vinyl and suddenly the needle jumps abruptly several seconds after the beginning of the song missing vital info, and this happens the same way in the rest of the tracks. I do have the original 12" vinyls (7 in total) so I'm sure exactly of what I'm stating here, my vinyls sounds a lot better than this ridiculous remaster. I WISH I WOULD GET MY MONEY BACK, I FEEL TOTALLY RIPPED. Great artists, great songs, great compilation, MORE THAN HORRENDOUS REMASTERED PRODUCTION. SOMEONE PLEASE MAKE JUSTICE TO THE ARTISTS THAT HAVE BEEN INSULTED HERE.
Produced by Dario Argento and directed by Lamberto Bava, this hyper-gory Italian film is about a group of people who are all given free tickets to a horror movie. Soon after it begins, the unsuspecting moviegoers, like the characters in the film, start turning into flesh-hungry zombies. It all sounds promising enough, but that's where the originality ends. The audience inexplicably finds itself trapped inside the theater and the rest of the movie is pure formula: a group of anonymous, one-dimensional characters is picked off one by one by the zombies, only to become zombies themselves, who (you guessed it) pick off the remaining anonymous, one-dimensional characters. Of course, Bava knows that it's all about the gore and, on that score at least, Demons really delivers. There's enough gut munching, eye gouging and scalp tearing to satisfy even the most hardened gorehound, and the special effects (courtesy of Argento regular Sergio Stivaletti) are about as good as they come. Thirty-something types will also appreciate the early `80s heavy-metal soundtrack, which features M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e ("Save Our Souls") and Accept ("Fast as a Shark"), among others.Two and a half stars out of five.
This book is based on false ideology that had been proved failed again and again through the history. It's sad that so many people nowadays try to change this nation into communist or socialism ( same role, just different name) not really knowing the truth, just based on some political ideology that human history had repeatedly proved to be failed. In fact communism is the worst political system that ever presented on earth. Because of its brutality, I escaped from that regime. And I am happy to be in this country where human freedom is mostly respected, and protected. Communist lies saying every one shares equally: In fact only, those few comrades who caused the shift of power enjoy the wealth and power, but the rest of the general citizens have no equality nor basic human right. Any one speak against government---disappear next day to "concentration camp" w/o fair trials nor justice. Communist shut down all religious freedom, or freedom of speech ( all medias are government controlled) Communists deny any form of gods but instead, they set the status of Stalin or Ma chiding, or Kimjung ill, and have to sing songs and salute for them, worship them. From elementary children to elders... Anyone dares to go against the government, ---labor camp! 1989, Tinamen square, a million chines college students marched to protest against their communist government of oppression: it was broadcasted all over the world, they were asking communist government to give them ;freedom for speech, freedom of media, business, religion, true-democracy ( not like few communist party people controlling, governing) but by election. Sooner the communist government sent them tanks and guns and indiscriminately shoot them and ran over with tanks. Whole world watched through television broadcast and shocked by their brutality. There is no "equal Justice" like the communist ideologist deceives people. Only "Elite Party Comrades" have the privileges of special health care, food market for themselves only, supply stores for them only, but the rest of the citizens live in dirt poor situation deprived from basic human rights. It's just a power shift from have to have not. Maybe somebody should arrange some "exchange living tourism" between these communist countries and America, Send those "Deceived communism lovers" to live in those communist countries for a year or two years by themselves without any privileges as American, but just as like their citizen, then maybe all these communism, socialism, totalitarian movement in American will learn the true lessons of the reality, and waken up. Also, reading the books by real defects form those communist countries will give real ideas, not just full of bologna, lying ideology (theory) books out there.Now some ignorant Americans already forgot about this just 20 years ago's brutality that we watched with our own eyes, want to change this great nation into communist?Please study the real history. I mean the "real history" not just that stupid "ideology of communist". In a word, if you study the true history, communist repeatedly failed last 150 years.and it's the most evil regime in the history. Why?: Stalin communist government killed 90 millions including the vicinity nations that were turn into communism, Macho-tong communist killed 100 millions, 2 millions by North Korea, by Cambodia each, 2 millions in Africa, 200,000 latin America..so on . But most of all they all became terribly poor after communist regime,oppressing the free capitalism, except China, because they started to adapt the partial capitalism from 10 years ago after they realized the harsh economic state. Now history tells also other totalitarianistic evil regime; Hitler killed 6 million jew with other 4 million of Europeans; Japan' imperialism killed 20 million Asians during WWII, ..so on.When communism and socialism oppress people's creativity and force them to work for "common Good", the productivity drops automatically. Why? men were not made to work for Common good. Maybe some aliens from different planet or maybe Jesus will do for common good. But not men's nature. That's why communism make every one poorer and poorer from their establishments throughout the history. When men get prosperous by working w their hards, with their creativity, they eventually help others if they are normal. because normal people appreciate God's wisdom of love and peace. But if the much power goes to God-hating communist, socialists or totalitarianistic government, you will see the corruption everywhere in their regime, instead of trying to help others or common good. Because they basically don't know, or appreciate God's wisdom of love and peace for all, they will fully manifest their selfishness and brutality filling only their throats. Why? that's the human nature w/o god. Human nature could be most brutal and selfish if they don't learn the true love from the creator as history repeatedly teach us.Men can't govern themselves.They are naturally selfish, greedy and evil w/o god. If any political party, government have too much power, they will certainly hurt others unless they truly know jesus who always teach love and peace. That's why our America's constitution is truly great, because it was written by the God's fairness and wisdom protecting basic human rights that is originally from God , over any political unbalance. I realized only those who hate God fall into these"denying the constitution, or "let's change it "theory saying they are too old or whatever nonsense. Too old constitution? Then why the whole world always look upon America when it comes, most well practiced freedom and human right? Please have reasons.If USA turned into communism, the power will shift to only those who hate the existing American system. They secretly controlling medias ( I already see it happened ) and brainwashing the youth with distorted facts in textbooks last 20 years. They keep change their names, their activity, and theory. Why? if they openly speak up, they know they will fail because any normal mind people will see the deception and its perversion. Look at these behind scenes of the head members. They are not normal mind, full of hatred, and causing always divisions, manipulations. Sadly this government & Geroge Soro' socialic, communistic, riots causing union leaders, hired many "paid bloggers from 4 years ago intensively promoting public hatreds & division. Real sad thing is most American publics are so ignorant, not knowing the behind scenes, get brain wash step by step through facebook, twitters, googles' net traffic.Many good people's web site had been already blocked from public access from 2010.Do u know who r the major donors to all the ivy league schools in America? Middle Eastern Islamic terrorists sponsoring extremists. We pour our oil money into these middle eastern countries, these islamic extremists trains terrorists w our money, sending back to USA to brain wash college kids, funding mosques, from 1960' pouring into American textbook committees to distort our history, fanning the Anti-america propaganda w socialists, communism movementtogether to destroy this great nation, but Americans are sleeping. While these trillion's forein oil money are eating up our nation, last prolong Democratic congress, government prohibit our own oil production saying "environmental protection". no wonder our debt is no more controllable. To any nation to be strong, they have to have their own supply of power sources. Get it? Can't go on with debts, especially to middle east. Though we fully develop all forms of green energy,it is still less than 50% of our energy sources. Before polar bears or dolphins, we are getting total broke, can't even protect them from international slaughters. Please think people & wake up from those hired bloggers & medias who were own by few extreme liberal bosses.Collect the real historic facts, separate from the author's propaganda. Lineup the real facts, then you will see the history more accurately. Always develop the "reasoning power" of your own this way, not swayed by many false propagandas in most books, medias out there. If you don't have your own reasoning power, you will be always vulnerable and get deceived.Interestingly always angry, poor people seem becoming the front line of deceived victims of these evil ideology. So instead, ask God to enlighten your heart to live with love and peace& goodness with others and ask your personal blessing instead of trying to destroy others who seems have.If you believe somebody or some classes hurt your people, look at this. Bible says: forgive your enemy, don't live with your past: Don't covet your neighbors: work diligently on your own hands so you don't steal, become a burden to others. And lastly, love your neighbors as yourself. Then you will live in the true blessing of God, the creator.Robbing others' or violance, riots r not the answers. God wants us to be : good, righteous, & truthful. Those citizens of china and all the other communist countries, including north koreaa, who are brutally oppressed in the middle Eastern Islam tyrannies still wants their human freedom with the destruction of the oppressing totalitarianistic regime still today. So why move to backward of mistakes people?
I first discovered this collection about two years ago, and what a find! The music is hauntingly beautiful, and a great diversion from the &quot;normal&quot; Christmas fare available today. From the first track by Nightnoise &quot;The Flight Into Egypt&quot; you are taken away to a new land, where the music is soothing and relaxing. What a cure for the stress of the holiday! If you are looking for brilliant music, with a wintery feel, pick up this album.
This product does the job with no problem. I had a dell laptop that I wanted to display on my tv screen. I had an s-video cable but needed the converter to connect it to the tv. Worked without a problem.
I've been a fan of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicle novels and the movie "Interview With The Vampire" for a long time, and just recently picked up the movie soundtrack in like new condition for $2 from an Amazon seller, and it was certainly a good purchase! Of course I've seen the movie before so I knew what the movie score sounded like, but listening to the music without the movie certainly is not a let down.This album is dark, brooding, with alot of feeling, and is great music for a vampire movie. Maybe not quite on the same level as the Lord of the Rings movie scores for example, but does it have to be?My only regret with this cd is that it does not contain any of the piano tunes that Lestat and Claudia play throughout the movie (which I LOVED), but the soundtrack is still very good regardless, and all of the other music from the movie that I can remember is on this cd. Some people have complained about the GNR Sympathy for the Devil song that is on the soundtrack. While it's true that it hardly goes with the rest of the movie score, it is still a part of the movie, so it's cool that it's represented here. Don't like Sympathy for the Devil? Don't listen to it - there are still 18 other very worthy tracks on this soundtrack. SFTD is the last track, so you can listen to the first 18 and then stop if you wish. I happen to like SFTD well enough anyway, so no problem for me at all.All in all - very well done release of a terrific movie score!
Oooh yehhhhhhh! I love these jokes even more than I like free shrimp and room service! EEEEEEhaaaaa! But, you know, I think i, I mean they, should be charging more. Not that I like money or anything. After all, I'm just a peace loving hippie from Bayville who enjoys eating clams from a garbage pail! HeeHeeHee! Come on! That's funny! Laugh!!
In addition to the original and well-conceived story of this series, what struck me the most was Pullman's really great pacing of the whole thing. Usually, stories have slower and faster moments to keep the reader moving along, but this series truly keeps your attention from the moment you begin until its conclusion. You'll find it hard to put down, so I recommend either getting this omnibus edition with all three books included or at least getting all three books at the same time. You'll be in agony waiting for the second or third book to arrive after reading the first!The His Dark Materials trilogy (The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass) is ambitious, original and intelligent. While geared for and marketed toward young adults, the complex themes and undercurrents in the story are relevant and fascinating for adult readers as well.Kudos to Pullman for creating such a high-quality literature offering!
This book is broken into two parts, the murder mystery and the Characteristics of Savannah, which include people as well as places. The author chooses to put himself in as a character as he relates the information about the murder he has investigated. He introduces the murderer in the first chapter, then doesn't revisit him until chapter 11. In the meantime he tells the reader about Savannah, the culture of the people, the kinds of attitudes of the people, he describes the homes and the characters. I found the book cumbersome and boring. It was supposed to make me want to go see this magical place. It didn't. I would see the movie only to see how it would relate to the book.
Firstly, before ordering online, please visit your local retailer and have a look/feel of the scope.I bought this to replace a 60mm telescope which is very inconvenient to use and has given me more frustration than pleasure. Please, don't even consider buying smaller telescopes.It took me about 2 hours to assemble the whole thing and I was being "helped" by children 3 year and 6 year old.The base is made of wood. Weight-wise, it easy to carry, but shape-wise, it is hard and awkward. I have been carrying it without dismantling the tube/barrel.In the beginning I was worried due to the lack of mechanism for fine adjustments. After I started using it, all my worries have disappeared - the movement is that smooth.The scope looks big. XT6 appears to be reasonable in size for home use. I haven't compared the two looking at the sky, but XT6 is only ~4 pounds lighter. XT8 permits 2" eyepieces, XT6 doesn't. XT8 doesn't come with any 2" eyepieces, though.Let me emphasize that it is very important for you to call Orion, find local retailers, call them to make sure that they have one on floor, visit them, and feel the scope.
This is a really, really good book. It sucked me in and I couldn't stop reading. I highly, highly recomend this book. The movie is also really good, too. A must read.~Atalanta
There are about 10 really good songs on this 22 track recording, and a few ok ones, especially if you like the beastie's instrumentals. in my opinion this makes it a very worthwhile buy, because those ten or so songs are REALLY good.
Snake in the Eagle's Shadow 1978 - 5/5Cast: Jackie Chan, Simon Yuen Sui Tin, Hwang Jang Lee, Roy HoranDirector: Yuen Woo PingProducer: Chen ChuanWriter: Ng See-Yuen (producer of Drunken Master)Everyone smokes Opium-(a brownish gummy extract from the unripe seed pods of the opium poppy that contains several highly addictive narcotic alkaloid substances, for example, morphine and codeine.) The Beggar so(Simon Yuen Sui Tin) Which is Yuen Woo Ping Father smokes it. Jackie Chans Master at his schools smokes it, as well as People on the street. Well the script written was based on the story created by Jackie Chan is good. It's so good in facts it's probable, in my opinion ,better than the other famous collaboration between Yuen Woo Ping and Jackie Chan(Drunken Master). The movie starts with Jackie Chan knowing nothing about kung Fu. He was the clean up boy in his master school of martial arts. One day he's walking and helps in old man escape from a fight. This old man is the legendary Simon Yuen Sui Tin who is the last surviving expert of the Snake Fist Style of Kung Fu. The master of the other style ,Eagles Claw, wants to kill all the remaining members of Snake Fist style. After stating that he has all ready killed 3,000 members he kills another, until there's only one left. Simon Yuen Sui Tin teaches the style to Jackie. This is a quote from Jackie Chan about his favorite lines in the movie "My favorite lines in the movie comes when I am using my newly learned snake fist against my opponent : my character shouts "I'm a poisonous snake" then gives him a quick punch to the groin and says :"That's called finding the snake."Well Jackie figures out how to combine a fighting style beggar so taught him and a style he witness his cat using. In which he sees his cat fighting a cobra. It was a real cat fighting a real cobra! He names it Snake fist in Cats paw. The old master doesn't like it so they change it to Snake in the Eagle's Shadow. Hence the Title.
I used to own the LP back in 1986 and lost it soon after in a fire. I never replaced it until yesterday.Turn back the clock time, I actually forgot how much I enjoyed this. The first 6 tracks are killer, I like all of them. In fact the only track on this disk that does not meet my approval is the ultra poppy cover of "I Aint Superstitous." While I am sure the original is very good, this one just doesn't fit on an otherwise dark disk.This CD contains my favorite Megadeth song of all time, Good Mourning/Black Friday. It starts out slow with the melancholy Good Mourning and builds up speed to the feverish intensity of Black Friday. IMO this has to go down as one of the best thrash songs of its genre. Its raw, it kicks, the only knock is that the lyrics are a little pedestrian, but I didn't buy this for the lyrics.For the milennium youth, if you like good hard thrash, this is a must add to your collection. I don't think they make metal like this anymore.
if you read Jane Green backwards, starting with this boring book and ending with say, Jemima J, you'll think Jane Green really improved with experience, and her novels got so much better over the years.In fact, they're just getting worse.The chick-lit author's pattern continues:Book 1 single and searchingBook 2 boyfriended and in a panicBook 3 married life- amusing "adjust-to-mishaps", but lovey-doveyBook 4 married life- bad, bad bad- divorce? (baby added at page 192 to cement outcome)Book 5 older, wiser, staying, but really boring now.
This was just what we were looking for. The only suggestion is that it be published in a waterproof/sweatproof edition (out on the jobsite in a pocket it gets pretty damp).
I was never a tea drinker, but after giving up coffee I was looking for another hot decaf drink for cold winter mornings. This tea fit the bill! It has a very nice licorice flavor and is sweet enough that it doesn't need any added sugar. There is no funny aftertaste that I seem to always get from other teas. If you like Licorice, I'm sure you will enjoy this tea.
This blower is fantastic - works great, and is so easy to carry and use. Excellent!
Simply a terrific CD. I have this in my car player, and friends often ask me who the singer is. Trainor has a wonderful voice and is backed up here by a great small combo that really swings.
This woman can sing!! But that's not what amazed me- what got me was she can effortlessly switch from one musical style to another and flawlessly don different personas. One moment she's country belle crooner, and the next song she's a broadway starlet, then she's a smooth rocker.Megan has a beautiful voice and her performances are so charismatic and delivered with so much personality that it's hard to not like this album!I shocked my husband with this, telling him I had a CD of &quot;Karen Walker&quot; singing. He said, &quot;oh, God,&quot; and laughed, because all the only thing most people know of her voice is the one she dons for her TV character. I hit play and he was blown away. He muttered &quot;wow!&quot; in reply.The first track, 'Bathroom Window,' she starts by belting &quot;She came in through the bathroom window...&quot; and there's no denying her talent, and the beauty and power of her voice from the get go. I was afraid that the song selection wouldn't be my cup of tea (I'm 23 and haven't heard of many of these songs), but I adore it.Go, go, Megan!!
I have, yet, to find the perfect mystery novel, but Coben's books are fairly close. They grab your interest from the start, throw enough red herrings at you to keep you guessing, and are an easy read.The plot in this book was well thought out. It makes sense, which is a compliment considering how many of today's mysteries leave such large holes in their plots that at the end you are more confused than satisfied.I bought the hardback version and it was worth the price.
This book is one of my favorite true crime books. I've read it a few times already. Christian Longo murdered his wife and children in 2001. The author of this book, Michael Finkel, lost his job as a writer for the New York Times in 2002. The two men cross paths along the way and it makes for one terrific read. Michael Finkel is an excellent writer.
I ordered this and was sent a totally different CD I could see if I had a huge order but it was 1 CD and they screwed that up. So I am sure my father would have enjoyed the CD if he could have received the right one.
The graphics are very nice, but the gameplay is not worthy of anything more than one star.This game is obviously just a beta test version. There is no useful tutorial to learn how to play this game, so don't bother purchasing this game. If you bother to spend more than a few minutes playing this game, you will quickly realize that the designers of this game did not bother to teach you how to play it. There is no tutorial at all. The windows that pop up have no explanation. This game is a perfect example of bad design. It may be fun for the people who designed it -- they know how to play it. But if you install this game and run it, you will get no instructions about how to play it.Bottom line: decent graphics but no instructions -- and not even a welcoming introduction to how the gameplay works. Stick with C&C; and don't waste your money on this game.
I wish I could agree with the Amazon reviewer; this one is not "pure, weightless elegance" unless you like being caught in a disco in the Castro, circa 1989. I'm actually a big fan of Sasha but find some of his stuff embarrassing to listen to. A lot of his drum and keyboard patches are very stale and he deploys a lot of them in the second half of this disc, along with some Amyl-snorting vocal parts that went out with Soft Cell.Involver starts out very promisingly, with the pleasing guitar parts (a new thing for Sasha) in "Dorset Perception" and the jagged synth rhythms in "These Days" and "What Are You to Me" but wraps up in kiddie-clubland. This disc is nothing like Airdrawndagger (which I loved) and is much closer to the Northern Exposure discs, most of which I also can't stand. For many listeners, this will tickle their nuts.
I love the adventurous spirit of Mr. Hackett, and he threw plenty of well-intentioned ingredients into the beaker here. Unfortunately this 1984 concoction blew up in Steve's face and never should have left the lab. From the faux-heavy-metal &quot;Myopia&quot; to the half-baked blues of &quot;Let Me Count The Ways&quot;, Hackett is all over the map here, groping in songcraft oblivion without ever finding the lightswitch.Deciding to record this album in Brazil, Steve splices in some fine Brazilian percussion on a few cuts. The trouble is, he forgot to write decent material around it. &quot;Matilda...&quot; uses a barely-altered version of the &quot;Camino Royale&quot; (from 1983's _Hightly Strung_) melody to tell a storyabout an old folks' home. Then he tacks a few minutes of Brazilian percussion are tacked onto the end. Does it all sound a bit too esoteric, unamusing, and lacking in direction? Well, that's the only conclusion I can draw.About the only bright spot here is the laid-back &quot;Taking The Easy Way Out&quot; where Steve finally (after nearly a decade of placing himself out of his depth) finds his vocal niche and turns in a respectable performance. However, not even his drummer - Ian Mosley, pre-Marillion - could dissuade Steve from marring the rest of the album by achingly straining his limited pipes. In addtion to the original mish-mash found on the LP, some nebulous mid-80s bonus tracks augment this re-ordered, remixed CD release. Incidentally, they are indulgent and plodding enough that they only add to the overall impression of the album as a creative fiasco.I began this review on a brief positive, so I'll do the same to end it. If you want a perfect example of a boldly eclectic album from Steve Hackett that succeeds everywhere that _Faces_ fails, pick up his well-conceived, lovingly crafted 1999 release _Darktown_.
Definitely not music, that's for sure. I can't believe Amazon ranked this the #3 album of the year!!! Where (...) is TransAtlantic's "Bridge Across Forever"? That deserves to be in the top 3 at least. This piece (...) they call "music" shouldn't even be in the top 100!! The "singing" is wretched!!! Stay away from this hipster (...). I would give it 0 stars if I could, but I can't. TERRIBLE NON-MUSIC.
It's a shame the story and script aren't up to the level of the animation.A movie with a Moral (i.e. Evil Is Bad), I'm not sure exactly at whom it's aimed. Too smarmy for kids, too dumb for adults, it ends up being for ... well, a few of the other good folks who reviewed and liked it, I guess. There's no accounting for taste, said the old lady as she kissed the cow.
I remember seeing this movie on TV as a movie of the week and never forgot it , I always thought this to be Ms Montgomerys finest films .I have only 1 wish that they would change this over to DVD but I will be just as happy as long as I have the VHS , this is a must see film !
First of all, I'd like to say that I'd give this CD a 4.5 instead of a 4, but that wasn't one of my options. ;-)I will admit that of all of the Rebecca St. James CDs I've listened to, this is the one that took the longest to grow on me. But a steady rotation of listening to it has made it slowly and surely grow on me. It's not as instantly addicted as Transform or God but don't discount the CD. It's got some great songs, sung by one of the great artist of our day and age--of any genre. Give this CD a try. You won't be disappointed.
I have to admit that I originally purchased this CD because I'm a huge Rainbow fanatic and wanted to hear what Joe Lynn Turner was doing after he left that group. Of course, I was well aware of Malmsteen's status as guitar virtuoso and studied Blackmore stylings... so that didn't hurt the cause of me throwing a few bucks into this CD either. I'm happy to say I was not disappointed. Yngwie is a flashier, more updated player than Blackmore (Ritchie still remains my favorite, though). The songs here are quite commercial sounding, which isn't surprising given Turner's presence. A couple of color-by-number ballads (Dreaming, Hold On) mixed with more typical fast fret burners (Riot In the Dungeons, the aptly titled Faster than the Speed of Light) make for an interesting listen. A couple of songs really stand out: Deja Vu, and my personal favorite Crystal Ball. Unfortuneately, Turner isn't a much better lyricist than David Coverdale, so you get an overdose of love-related themes. A small complaint though. This record is very late '80s sounding and will always remind me of summer days during my high school years.
Don't be afraid! They'll help you get stronger with your other excercises. I never did squats, mostly out of ignorance, until I read this book. This book is an excellent companion to Brawn. I feel the authors have similar, if not compatible, training philosophies. Use the guidelines from Brawn to help you determine the question of training frequency.
This original 1931 classic has seen several releases over the past twenty something years. First on VHS with restored footage that had been deleted by censors in 1931 including Dr Frankenstein's ecstatic delivery of the line: "In the name of God, now I know what it is to be God!" The Legacy Collection from 2004 gave us an improved picture, some related extras, and other original Universal titles that include the name Frankenstein like "Bride of.." "Son of.." "Ghost of..' and "House of...". And now we have the 75th Anniversary version with even better picture and sound as well as many of the extras included on previous versions with the addition of the wonderful feature documentary "Universal Horror." While I consider the multi-film Legacy set to be the best deal because of content, this 75th anniversary version is worth buying as well because of the the improved transfer and added documentary. I expected a 75th Anniversary release of 'Bride of Frankenstein" since there is a newly restored print avialable but since we are one week from Halloween with no word it doesn't seem likely.
Unable to resist the hype, I bought a PSP today. As others have said, it is extremely impressive. The TFT display is wide, bright, and beautiful. The case is glossy and shows fingerprints but is very attractive as well. The controls are above average for a handheld device, and onboard sound is great, especially with (included) headphones.Yes, it's an expensive toy, but in the same price ballpark with similar portable tech items such as digital cameras, iPods, and PDAs such as Pocket PCs and Palm devices. The PSP has aspects of all these devices.The Value Pack comes with everything you need to get started except for a game: an adequate recharcheable battery, a small but usable memory stick, power adapter, remote control headphones, slipcover. None of these accessories are of super-high-quality, but it's good that the basics are included. Spider-Man 2 the movie in Sony's proprietary UMD format is a nice bonus and shows off the video quality.In my opinion this isn't an essential purchase if you don't already have a home console system -- it makes sense to get a Playstation 2, a GameCube, or an XBOX before springing for one of these -- but if you're a gadget or game fan, it's certainly worth considering if you have the cash to spare.
As the author of this book, I wrote the following brief review as a "model review" to be sent out with review copies.This "sourcebook for skeptical seekers" aims to speak to the minority of Americans who don't find meaning in conventional religion, but who still want to develop greater moral depth. A demanding program of self-improvement emerges: connect to others, learn to meditate, find heroes, define your ethics, prepare a legacy, simplify life. The results of such a "secular life practice" might or might not be, as the author claims, the same as religion produces, but they could only be healthy. Were it lighter and folksier, this book might have been "Chicken Soup for the Scientist's Soul," but with its educated prose, end-notes, bibliography and two indexes, Secular Wholeness would have to be "Soup to nuts for the soul with port and cigars after."...
A glimpse of the cover and you're hooked. One listen and this platter extraordinaire will squat in the flats between your ears -- permanently. Even if you only got "Complete Control" accompanied by eleven polkas and a Britney Spears single, this album would still qualify as essential listening. Lucky you, there's "Janie Jones," "White Man in Hammersmith Palais," "Jail Guitar Doors," the brilliant reggae cover "Police and Thieves," the list goes on and on -- every song, with the possible exception of "Remote Control", stands out hard and adrenalized. The American release (take heed) is far superior to the earlier UK version, which sags with throwaway tunes like "48 Hours". British punk has two defining albums: the Pistols' "Bollocks" and this the Camden Town "garage" work of a foreign service brat gone guttersnipe, a rock poodle with tower block cred, and the angular spike top who sends off shards of cool. As for that song "Complete Control", it may well be punk's high water mark. At max volume the twin guitar homestretch, which follows a break punctured by Strummer's eloquent "Huh?", leads even the meek to the ramparts. Empires fall in its wake - at least they seem to.
i was lucky enough to see them live with James in Philadelphia before hearing this album. they were great live and i enjoy Sugar & Spite in my living room where i can appreciate the words even more. it's very mellow but not lazy, catchy but not trite.the band was nice enough to sign my copy at the show. check it out it's worth the money.
Not great coffee. Rocamojo and PuraVida, which amazon also sells is so much better--and those aren't great just good. This is cheap coffee and tastes like it. I can't complain much at about $3 a pound but it's just ok, drinkable, but wouldn't buy again.
I thought Avril's first album was a refreshing change of pace from the oversaturation of pop princesses we were suffering from at the time of its release. I liked 'Complicated,' and loved 'I'm With You.' With this new second release, Avril doesn't stray from the formula of the first CD. She goes at it again, but this time with a bit more finesse.Fans will be glad to know that she hasn't abandoned the style she worked in the first release. She's remained relatively unchanged, as a matter of fact, except that she's become a bit more sophisticated with her songwriting.Unlike Dido's sophomore release, which was a bit redundant, Avril manages to maintain the same feel and vibe without sacrificing ingenuity. It manages to stay fresh without too much change.This album could easily be titled, &quot;Let Go: The Sequel.&quot; The first single, 'Don't Tell Me' sounds like it could be the sequel to 'Complicated,' and 'My Happy Ending' sounds like the flip side to 'I'm With You.' I'm not asserting that Avril wrote and recorded the new songs to be follow-ups to any of her older stuff. The songs are undeniably written by the Avril we got to know from 'Let Go,' but this time with a few more life experiences under her belt, it seems.Avril's fans should be pleased that she's remained relatively unchanged. Older fans will be glad to know that despite this, she's still managed to grow.
Mirrors Rainbow Six 3 in many ways...good graphics. Love the way the enemy uses his rifle to hobble away when you shoot him in the leg. Many of the same tactics are still used today in Advanced Warfighter...
Have to admit this is my first exposure to Freddie (Freddy) King and was very impressed. His combination of the Chicago and Texas blues guitar style is very evident in the playing of several blues masters including Eric Clapton.Some excellent cuts from his 3 year stint with Shelter records with Leon Russell at the helm playing piano and some guitar on every cut with great session players like D. Dunn from Booker T. and Carl Radle and Jim Gordon from Derek and the Dominoes.His solos are very vibrant his voice is great and at times eerily (to me anyway) much like EC's and as Eric Clapton wrote &quot;(Freddie) taught me how to make love to the guitar&quot;.Very highly recommended.
This was a good project to do with my 9-year-old grandson, with him reading the instructions, getting the pieces, and telling me what to solder where. He learned about the resistor color code, and about capacitor units. Earlier he had already assembled the similar (but pre-wired) 21-890 line-tracking robot, and we therefore already had laid out a course for it to follow. The trace should be black tape of at least 3/4" width, without sharp corners, on a large white paper or posterboard background; right-angle crossings as in a figure-8 track work fine.I soldered it with an Elenco SL-5 40-W soldering station, which worked well, but would be far too difficult and dangerous for my grandson, because the long iron tip is not shielded, and the holder for the soldering iron on the soldering station is clamped rather than scewed in, and came loose far too easily. I do not recommend this unit for small hands, and in fact burned myself on it twice during the project.It took some looking around to find the proper instructions in the instruction manual for all the electrical pieces, because the necessary information (such as color code for resistors, and polarity for capacitors) was scattered over several places, but the completed unit worked flawlessly on its first try. The transparent top shaped like a mouse is neat. If you can do the soldering for your youngster, and (s)he can feel in charge by guiding you, this is a nice project to do together. If (s)he is old enough to solder, more information in the manual about the computer inputs and on how that computer makes its decisions would be useful; now that computer is a black box.
The 6th edition hardcover is a handsome book, filled with huge amounts of information. The method employed in this book is different than other instructional texts; it presents you with a vast number of grammatical rules early on, and then forces you to translate. It is a baptism by fire, and can be pretty challenging.However, the reading selections are delightful, many taken from Roman authors of the first century B.C. There is even some Horace to keep you on your toes.One thing you will need to do, is get the answer key from Harpers, since not every exercise in the book has one. This wasn't a problem for me -I simply emailed the publisher and they sent me the answer key. I had it within 4 days. If the key was included in the text, it would be 100 pages longer at least.If you are studying Latin, I also recommend the book "501 Latin Verbs" as another resource. If you are brand new to the language, you may want to start with the Cambridge Latin course, units 1 & 2, and then read the Wheelock's.
With so many other reviews I'll keep mine short. I am an adult man without kids who avoided this set for a while because I thought it was "for kids". I finally picked up Book 1 and was hooked. The author creates an entire universe with history, well developed characters, and layers of intrigue... all in an easy to read (very addictive) style.Don't avoid it because you think it's just for kids... it's great for anyone. The whole set is well worth reading over and over again.
This is the most uplifting and beautiful record I've heard in some time. It's not so soft and ambient where you lose interest either. Most of the songs have a nice rock edge and occasional Jon Anderson-like vocals. At least 5 of these songs couldn't possibly be better. In my opinion, these 8 songs make both of the m83 albums appear less accomplished. I seriously am thinking of buying about 5 copies of this and sending it to friends, despite the P2P age we live in.
It is hard to prove that this does any good. I was having trouble thinking thigs through and adding a column of numbers. I have been able to think more clearly since I started taking it, and have less muscel aches. SO! I think it works and have recomended it to other old folks.
Was tired of eating Teflon pieces. Went back to stainless. These are great. Highly recommend these.
I'm no expert on Herman's bands, but I have several other collections and this is far and away the whimpiest. Well over half the songs are sentimental ballads or comic novelty numbers. If you like those kinds of songs, this is your collection. But if you're looking for the up-tempo, full-tilt, straight ahead swing that (I thought) Herman was best known for, this is a big disappointment.
I bought this to replace an older copy, which I truly loved. However, this cheap copy does not play in a variety of CD players and the jacket has no information beyond the song list. I'll be staying away from "Legacy Recordings" from now on.
THE HOLCROFT COVENANT - 4 STARSI never liked much espionage, spy books at all. I used to think that all of them were boring and too complicated. This changed when I read that book. THE HOLCROFT COVENANT has a very interesting plot that the reader is able to understand without much problems. I'm not saying here that the plot is not intricated. It really is! But Robert Ludlum does it so wonderfully that the reader goes on reading without notice if it's morning or night. He's the best spy book I've ever read, I say this without hesitation. Frederick Forsyth is another good author, but Robert Ludlum is much, so much better. I became addicted to Robert's books when I read that one. Now I love this kind of book to death and would really love to have more and more books by Mr. Ludlum on the following years, God willing. If you don't like much this genre, try this book and start to enjoy it. If you're already a fan of spy books, THE HOLCROFT COVENANT is a must-read, I assure you. Long writing life to Mr. Robert Ludlum! He's just the best on his craft! Try him and you won't be dissapointed.
I own the DVD of this, but the Blu-Ray update is AMAZING!!It is totally worth buying the same exact DVD over again with all the same features but to see it picture itself clearer andsharper.WOW--it is AMAZING.
It's amazing to me which films endure and which don't. After 40 years, "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" looks like a relic from another era, and it's considered an all-time classic. Yet 30 years after it's release, Daniel Petrie's minor 1976 film "Lifeguard" looks as good now as it did upon its release, and remains as timely and vital as ever, even though noone would consider it a classic of its era.Actually, on the big screen, "Lifeguard" resembled a glorified TV movie. On TV, however, it looks great, especially in this wonderful widescreen transfer. And it serves as a reminder that sometimes small, heartfelt films with modest aspirations can endure and be effective long after the same era's pretentious and overblown message pictures. "Lifeguard" could be described as "Baywatch" with brains, but its much more than that. How wonderful it is to see a movie set in Southern California and on the beach where the beachgoers look like real people and not surgically-altered superbabes. And although all of the featured lifeguards are men, you get the idea if they hired a woman, she'd look like Alexandra Paul and not Pamela Anderson. Even the women star Sam Elliott gets involved with look like real, average women--future Oscar nominees Kathleen Quinlan and Anne Archer chief among them. Believe me, it's a real treat to watch normal people onscreen for a change.Elliott stars as Rick, a career lifeguard who is beginning another summer on the beach, with a new assistant/trainee (Parker Stevenson). He befriends a lonely teenager (Quinlan) who has just moved to L.A. from San Diego (and who has an obvious crush on him), has a few one-night stands and meets his parents for dinner, whereas his father lets him know he's tired of his son wasting his life at the beach. This sends him into an early mid-life crisis, especially when an old high school friend who owns a Porsche dealership offers him a "respectable" job selling cars. But it's not until he attends his 15-year high school reunion and reunites with his divorced high school flame Cathy (Archer) that he begins to seriously consider hanging up his trunks for good, especially when Cathy lets him know her interest depends on it. So, obviously, Rick has some serious thinking to do: give up the job he loves for the respectability of a job he doesn't. It's a simple story, but as most simple stories do, it resonates still."Lifeguard" is a sweet, even funny movie that will obviously appeal to women, but is also a painless date film. The entire cast is good, with Elliott the obvious standout. Filmed before he matured into the grizzled, tough cop/cowboy/military type he now excels at, it's refreshing to see him play such a regular, flawed guy. My only problem with his character is that he is so level-headed, a decision he makes involving his relationship with Quinlan's character seems completely out of character and even more stupid than it is. Maybe it's because today's morality is so much different than it was then. Either way, it's a jolt. Also, Quinlan is typically wonderful, and Stevenson offers able support as the rookie and Rick's sounding board. Archer, although second-billed, doesn't make her entrance until the second half of the film and then has barely ten minutes screen time. She's professional as always.The photography and look of the film still look great so many years later, with none of the swimwear or fashions seemingly out-of-date, compared to other eras. And, yes, the song "Time and Tide" by Paul Williams, which was cut out of the TV prints, makes a welcome return, as so many others have noted.In all, **** (out of *****) for "Lifeguard". Unfortunately, this is a typical no-frills, no-extras presentation from Paramount DVD. But at least they continue to present these old gems in widescreen, so thanks for that.
Why is it every time someone starts raving about how good an item is thats so cheap, amazon boosts the price up about 30 dollars? Seriously wtf.
These are discs made by CMC (CMC MAG M01) for TDK. They do not support 16X write speed. They are 12X write maximum. If you want 12X discs, you can get them cheaper than this.If you want 16X, then don't buy these. These are not labelled correctly and should not be sold as 16X discs.
The day I put together my new treadmill I ran my hand between the belt and and base because I'd heard that belt lubricant is important and was curious to see if it came that way (lubed) or if I needed to do it myself prior to running...and it was already done by the manufacturer. But this also proved to me its importance.I do want to keep it running as smoothly as it did the day I got it so I decided to keep up my own treadmill maintenance with the silicone lubricant. Even in the early stages of treadmill use, the difference is obvious when the belt is well lubricated and the most important aspect of this maintenance is that it keeps your belt moving easily so it stays on track rather than gripping the base. If it doesn't flow easily it can get off course and the edges of the belt can wear down. I'd rather pay a few bucks for upkeep then far more for a new belt and someone to put it on my treadmill.It's a small bottle, a little goes a long way, and it seems to be lasting and lasting so I doubt I'll have to spray any on again for quite some time...well worth the purchase price for me.
I've enjoyed some other Le Carre books (The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, Smiley series, etc.), so I thought I knew what I was getting into with this book. But I didn't. It was incredibly boring. To call it a spy novel is beyond a stretch, it's more of a character study as another reviewer posted. At least the other Le Carre books I've read have good climaxes with nice twists in the end. Not this one. His writing style really began to grate on me after a while. There's no doubt that he can turn a phrase, but the florid language became incredibly tedious. If the hallmarks of good writing are brevity and clarity then he failed on both accounts, but especially the former.
As in many mystery stories, the main character in this novel is supposed to have some expertise with guns. Unfortunately he must depend on Mankell, whose expertise is apparently nil. His detective has the (predictable) distaste for firearms and Mankell has him "set the safety" on a revolver. What's next? The "well-oiled" cliche? The "smell of cordite"? (Even the great James Ellroy once had somebody putting a silencer on a Colt Python.) So get off your butts, mystery writers, and do a little research. Would that kill you?Other than that, it was a good read.
I was watching t.v. late one night not long ago and the 1976 version of King Kong was on t.v. and I started watching it, and was soon hooked. Soon after, I bought the dvd for $10 at Best Buy, and don't regret it! A classic remake with that cheesy 70's feel to it, and at times feels a little corny, but at other times feels pretty effective.Let me get to the special effects. Let's remember that in 1976, the art of CGI hadn't been perfected quite yet, and your choices were either clay-animation, a guy in a gorilla suit against a blue screen, or a mechanical ape. I thought, for it's day, Kong was pulled off pretty darn well. A couple of scenes in New York I thought he looked obviously mechanical, but I can overlook it. The close ups of Kong's face looked pretty realistic to me, even by today's standards.Lange & Bridges were both excellent, as you would expect from two well known actors. I can't remember the character's name, but the guy who wanted to capture Kong and bring him back was such an idiot, that I laugh every time he says "That is an escape proof cage!" as Kong has pretty much already torn the cage apart, hehe...An interesting change made to this remake was rather than just making out Kong to be nothing more than a 50 foot tyrant wreaking havoc on New York City, to give the audience a feeling of pity for Kong and for me at least, I felt a bit sorry for him when the choppers were taking him down. I'm not sure how realistic it is that these people didn't want Kong destroyed, but it did add a touch of depth to the movie. You decide, but I thought this movie, at the very worst, was at least entertaining.
This is a good toy for just staring at it, dont for using or playing just for seeing (if you guys knows what I mean). Its very realistic and I put it on a corner of my room together with my other collectibles.
Ok, I am a little bit off the beat'n path with this review...it's definitely not my genra of expertise.But I really like how this one makes me feel! It's a "feel good" poppy hip-hoppy kind of thing. Nice meaty dance beats and some really good songwriting in my opinion. It may not be true to the "gun-slinging, ho-boppin'" writing styles of most hip-hop/rap I hear these days...which is probably one reason why I like it so much.
What are you talking about, seriously. Get a clue. They never played Bad, WOWY, Until The End Of The World, or Party Girl in the two shows they taped. Those shows were May 9 and 10. All but the last two songs are from May 10. The last two are from May 9 due to Vertigo being played twice on May 10. You would probly complain if they had Vertigo on there twice. Oh and Bonos voice is much better now than on PopMart, duh duh duh. His voice sounded strained and weak on PopMart. Bono even admits this in th Rolling Stone interview. I do agree about Elevation Boston though, way overproduced and forced. This will not be like that. May 10 was a great show. I was there, it rocked end of story. The crowd was very into it being Bonos birthday and all. SO Im going to get this DVD and enjoy it for a lifetime, but for you dont bother seriously.
This book deserves TEN stars, it is clearly THE state of the art, best written overall book on climate change that is available in published format! Its writing, page design, referencing, index, etc., are all the best there is..it's full of incredible graphs, facts, ideas, solutions, warnings, and insight!Beyond all the above, the reviewers quoted on the back cover, say it so well, including the comments, "Joe Romm knows what he is talking about"! "If you buy only one book about global warming, make it Hell and High Water". And lastly, "Finally, a book that puts it ALL together".
I think I speak for all public librarians when I say, &quot;I HATE THIS BOOK.&quot;I hate the fact that I have to keep it behind the desk so it won't get stolen. I hate that people constantly ask for it because they are either A. Naive enough to believe you can get something for nothing or B. Lazy enough to expect to get something for nothing or C. Pathetic because they are depressed and think that this Lesko con artist can save their lives.I hate that nothing in it is true, or is true but has been warped by his presentation to the point that the less sophisticated John Q. Publics think that they can get a million dollars just by filling out some obscure form (which we don't carry) and mailing it to some obscure address (which we do not have a listing for).I don't believe in banning books, or starting book bonfires, but I really, really, really wish this book would go out of print. Permanently.
The oboe quintet occupies one of the odd little nooks of chamber music, but when Arnold Bax created a jewel, he inspired two notable British successors to attempt the same. Oboist Pamela Pecha Woods and the Audubon Quartet translate these very different cousins into three splendid performances.Soloist Woods dazzles with a pure tone and quiet virtuosity. Her tone blends seemlessly with the strings, as do her perfect intonation and articulation. The strings navigate the different styles of these three works with intelligence and a lovely but ever-adapting sound: The three composers never give the strings a chance to coast into accompaniment mode, and every moment is a challenge met superbly by the five musicians.I own a different release of the same recording, with the soloist credited as Pamela Woods rather than Pamela Pecha. Under either name, or as Pamela Pecha Woods, she is hard to find. Once assistant principal in Cleveland and later with the San Antonio Symphony, she has apparently moved to the background, so that Google reveals her name on public radio playlists but hardly anywhere else. I hope she's still enjoying the music wherever she may be.
Basically, this is a game that wraps multiple types of game play into one package. That is where this game went wrong. Also, some of the "HIGH" ratings were kids or people that reviewed this game based on the DEMO!!! You cannot truly rate a game unless you have played through the whole thing. THAT IS HOW THE GAMING MAGAZINES DO IT!!!Any designer, manufacturer, builder knows that it is almost impossible to make an effective "ALL-IN-ONE" device because it usually does some things very well and some things fairly well or poorly.In this game, you play from the 3rd person perspective, more like you hover over your currently active squad. You command your teams of soldiers with mouse clicks and key commands while receiving orders from an off-site commander.Now this is unique! However, this is what stinks! You feel like your watching the action more than participating. You also have to wrestle with hard to observe terrain, angles, camera views and if you make a mistake, you cannot quickly respond. Ouch! Oh, did I mention that the game has designated save points? Yep! So if you blow it, you must go back to the last save point and start again. This is not horrible, but not pleasant either.The good parts are that this game really requires you to think, use strategy, be patient, it is unique, there are some excellent tutorials (about 30-40 minutes worth) to help you learn the skills you'll need to get started, and the game brings in outside support like helicopter recon, mortar/artillery support, Armored Bradley vehicles. This game also offers Co-Op play which is a nice addition. I do like the hardcore cursing in this game (M****rF****r is one shining example) because I am an adult and I want adult level, realistic games. Kids don't need to play every game ok? That is what the ESRB ratings system is for. So I say thank you to the developers for doing it! You will not find ammo, health paks, aliens, space stations, rocket cars, jet packs, or secret weapons laying around or on the dead bodies or behind hidden walls. If you run out of ammo, your stuck!The bad parts are complicated camera angles, buggy response to your commands at times, the game is a bit of a hog on resources, the action is not that exciting, the visuals are not bad but not great, there is a lot of unnecessary HARDCORE cursing(I LOVE it but any parent with a kid under 18 probably will not !!) This game is VERY short too! Just as your skills are starting to get good, the game is over!Who is this game good for? -If you like RTS(real time strategy) games but wish you could get more deeply immersed in them...this game will excite you. I doubt this will appeal to 1st person shooter fans that don't like RTS games.Overall, I appreciate it for it's uniqueness. Yet, I also found it very unsatisfying. Due to the lack of excitement, poor camera angles, slow, clumsy response of your soldiers, mediocre AI for the enemies and buggy action...I cannot recommend this game.I will make a prediction though - I bet that another company will make a similar game only better or there will be a FSW 2 and the developers will have tweaked it into a lean, mean, shoot'em up game by learning from their mistakes. For the present - I would not bother with this game.
Left this product running for 10 hrs and caught ZERO fleas. It did catch 4 other smaller insects. The moment I walked with my long white socks to retrieve this item, I had 5 fleas jump on me. I wonder if they started using some bad glue.
Anything I say about Sgt. Pepper's would be superfluous, so I'll just say that it is a classic slice of 60's psychedelic pop that is an essential part of any rock fan's collection. Beatles politics aside, the band are as cohesive as ever. The album runs more as an episodic song cycle than as a concept album. The only downfall is that Martin's production has aged a little, but as they say, "A great song is a great song". Well, a great album is a great album. I can't recommend it enough.
Digital photography is only as good as the printer one uses. I have a great Nikon D70 but was getting terrible prints. I researched printers and found the i9900. Fantastic! The prints are smooth as silk and wonderful. Be sure and use Canon Photo Pro paper for the best print quality. Be aware that the printer is large and takes up a bit of room (24 inches wide). Not really desk size. I also bought the Canoscan 9950F for scanning negatives into prints and it is also impressive. So far I am sold on Canon products.
Yundi Li won several international piano competitions, the Gina Bachauer Young Artists International Competition, and 2000 Chopin Competition in Warsaw, Poland. He has foresworn further competitions.Having first established his name in Southern China (where he and his family resides - Shenzhen) after his Warsaw win as a `pop' classical pianist, mainly owing to his physical resemblance with the girlish idol Takuya Kimura of Japan's hot favourite pop group `S.M.A.P.', he went to Hannover in Germany to further his musical studies.On keyboard, Li is perhaps more reminiscent of Murray Perahia. His light and transparent touching often assume a jeweled, perfumed flavor. This feat is probably the trademark of Li's piano playing: lush and beautiful, whether you want it so or not.While Li remarked that there two sides to his nature: poetic and passionate, the Liszt No. 1 is a thermometer piece to Li's passion.The first movement opens in grandeur. There are lots of fiery sparks and the powerful harmonics all anticipative of an even more impassioned final movement. Some how, however, the temperature failed to maintain, and the third and fourth movements melt into an anti-climax, with the last movement ending in a rather hurried and grittily under-powered finale. No perfumes or jewelry for Liszt.Keyboard pyrotechnics aside, Li still has way to go towards heavily demanding repertoire like Liszt and other Eastern European romantic composers. Perhaps, like F'ou T'song, he should build his repertoire along the French impressionistic school.The Chopin No. 1 was a piece that Yundi Li played at Warsaw. While I would not go into detailed comparisons of this with his earlier performance some 6 years ago, this is overall a much more refined performance, and cleverly placed at the end of the disc instead of the Liszt No. 1.For fans of Yundi Li, perhaps the Chopin concerto alone is enough to justify this disc. The case packaging by DG is also an upgradeing, as such are often used in SACDs, and comparing to cheap CD cases employed for the Beethoven Concertos by Lang Lang, such packaging is super-luxurious indeed, as is in tune with Yundi's love of luxurious stuff, so glaringly promulgated by the Grammophone (China) and the CAAC inflight magazine alike.
This product was awful and a waste of my time, effort, and excitment. It only worked for about 5 or 6 minutes the first couple times I used it, then stopped working all together. iRobot was very difficult to work with.
this is a wartime British comedy...the stars are the British answer to Abbott and Costello, but without any of the vaudeville style physical comedy. The British are too polite for physical slapstick and pratfalls at this point in cinema history. The story is a pleasant farce about foiling nazi spies....Alastair Sim runs away with the movie and steals most of his scenes...he's a natural and very dynamic actor, miles ahead of everybody else in the film. I like this dry polite style of British humor but many will find it to be slow and restrained. Its nice to see the stalwart British making comedies during The Blitz of WW2...Winston Churchill would have been proud. At $20 I think the DVD is way overpriced. $8 would be a fair price.
Very funny book. Being female and over 40, I was many of the girls (at one time or another in my lifetime so far) that T. Max describes in his book. Even so, it is sometimes hard to read thru the good ol' boy humor. I laughed in spite of it all and that makes me glad I bought this book. Certainly geared towards the male funny bone and women who like a good male bone too :)
A fantastic development for Fear Factory. A concept album which tells the story of a future world, aggressive opening tracks `Shock' and `Edgecrusher' telling the tale of the fight against oppression culminating in the sad finale `Timelessness'. The story behind the fantastic tracks is an important one, technology does not replace spirituality. And `Ressurection' is one helluva track.
The product picture of this item (Lighted Adjustable 10X Mirror compact) does not reflect its physical size. The actual unit is much smaller than what the picture may suggest. The small size makes it suitable as a compact travel mirror. On the other hand, you also have to cope with its limitations:1. The mirror is less than 4 inches in diameter. Combined with high magnification, it gives a very limited visible area. This means you can only examine a small region of your face at any one time. Plus you only have a working distance of 4-5 inches from the mirror.2. The two miniature incandescent light bulbs are far from "super bright" as advertised. A set of four AAA alkaline cells (*) can only provide useable illumination for around 2-3 hours. It would be better if LED light sources were used.In my particular case, I kept this compact mirror in my office in case of emergency Do-It-Yourself eye surgery (I have problems with inward growing eyelash). It has just the right size and magnification for this intended purpose. But if you need something for daily usage at home, better look for a magnified mirror with a diameter of at least 8 inches, such as theDaylight Fluorescent Lighted 10X Mirror.(*) Footnote: The battery compartment accepts four AAA cells. But the cells are actually connected two-in-parallel, in order to double the operating time. A better solution is to power the lights with just two AAA rechargeable cells (as shown in my Customer Image).
This book, which demonstrates the morality and compassion of a writer who has been offhandedly dismissed as a "cynic" by many critics, made me realize why I have always been so attracted to Bierce.Bierce's personal stoicism, coupled with his literary romanticism, resulted in some of the most memorable stories in the history of American literature.This is the best piece of Bierce criticism since Cathy Davidson's book about Bierce's influence on the postmoderns.Highly recommended.
My expectations weren't terrifically high. If, as reported this was written (in part) by a thirteen year old, then she did a fine job. However, as pure cinema...This flick is highly overrated.So, she slept with guys, did drugs, shop-lifted, and wore slutty clothes...Again, it's all Lifetime quality fare. I found nothing compelling about the characters and I wasn't the least bit invested in their outcome...In fact, while watching, I found my attention wavering, quite a bit.After Kids, films like this just don't have the same shock-value.
Some recordings are unconventional. Others may even be called strange, and a few are just downright bizarre. These recordings by Russell Sherman undoubtedly fit in that final category. What is he doing? I've no idea, really. You get the idea that he is seeing all these sonatas for the first time ever and tries to sight-read his way through the scores. Such an odd thing like a measure beats does not exist for him, and he apparently didn't have any time left to take notice of the dynamic marks while playing. I guess that if Sherman sat behind a piano at this very moment, he'd do something completely different with the music again, and tomorrow everything would be changed once more. There's nothing such as a real 'interpretation' in Sherman's recordings: these are completely randomised, improvisatory recordings that do not make any particular overall impressions, other than that they left me totally confused. (And it surely does seem a bit odd to me to call him a master of timing and integration).It is that he has an absolutely lovely tone, and that some of his odd improvisations are even interesting to hear once, so that at least part of the recordings are bearable. There certainly is a certain smoothness to his sound, that can make part of his playing exquisite, especially in the slow movements. And sometimes he does ingenuous things - in the second opening chord of the Hammerklavier, he adds (deliberately?) an extra note that sounds wonderful, incorrect as it may be. And sure, it is all *very* refreshing...But to what cost would you want music to be refreshed? There is absolutely no sense of structure or character in Sherman's playing - he randomizes everything, as said, without regard for what is coming next. After the opening chords of the Hammerklavier, to give just one example, you'd expect the pianist to `build' into something, from a simple melody to those massive chord jumps. Sherman though, does absolutely nothing with this. In fact, his playing almost becomes SOFTER the closer he gets to the climax. As the chords arrive, he just thumps them out indifferently and clumsily and hardly with power (you'd suspect his technique isn't that accurate), and the following descending octaves are bizarrely articulated. I need not go one about the rest of the movement - it's similarly weird and without any momentum. So what, uh, 'effect' does this way of playing actually have? It doesn't follow logic laws anywhere nor can it make particular 'coherent' sense.And if anyone thinks that this extreme liberty-taking adds anything in interesting 'expressiveness': no way. If Sherman says that he merely wants to 'address' Beethoven's music, I wonder what he means with that word - he does not quite address nor express a lot. Take the op.106 Fugue. Sherman tries to play very exquisitely and softly most of the time (at least he is coherent in that sense!) but at the same time wants to portray the uneasiness of the movement - i.e. he tries to express something different than he is playing. It makes a rather, excuse the word, constipated impression. Needless to say that there is little contrapuntal structure to be found, too.It is safe to say that Sherman makes a better impression in the slow movements. There are fewer notes to toy with here, less dynamics too, so the music flows more naturally anyway. It is ironic, as some critics have remarked too, that he is at his best when he does *not* mess around with the music, but that is simply the case. The pianist's tone is really beautiful and rhapsodic at times, and he definitely sounds more at ease. I have to say that I'm still not too enthusiastic - Sherman's tempo mannerisms are still everywhere. You'd wish he would just keep it straight for a *few* seconds at least; things might become so much more impressive then.I've talked mostly about the Hammerklavier so far, but it is largely representative for the rest of these extraordinarily pricey cd's. The op.2/3 is quite impossible, especially in the two outer movements. In the final, things seem to be alright for a few measures, until Sherman starts articulating the left hand in a bizarre way - what else is new. The Pathetique is better, although still random and lacking momentum - the other reviewer is right here. The two small sonatas are alright but not very special either. The best of the set may be the G major sonata, which gets a rather straight, clear and charming performance - again, why doesn't he just do this all the time? As for the op.78, it's pretty much a mess again - for a really interesting wayward performance of this piece I'd rather hear Gould.There are many 'alternative' performance of Beethoven available, and I certainly wouldn't say I want everything straight and authentic (Glenn Gould's way with Beethoven, to name something, is really hilarious and very enjoyable). The question with Sherman is, does his out-of-mainstream approach pay very much dividend? I'd say not. There is an occasional moment he is refreshing - but there are all too many more moments he leaves one in total confusion. Giving a score is difficult - I've opted for two stars because of an occasional moment of pleasure, but most of this is really worth 1 star or less. At any rate, if I want to hear delightful Beethoven in a way that indeed, 'addresses' the music primarily I'd much rather listen to Kempff who has twice as much improvisatory talent as Sherman and unendingly more understanding of musical structure. And otherwise there's always Arrau for a straight dose of pure greatness.
We couldn't WAIT to take this toy out of the package! We already own the Fast Tracks toy from Mega Blocks which also has ramps and such - so naturally since we had so much fun with the first one we had to tear into the second! There are so many fun interative elements to this toy - the elevator makes noise as you lift it up, the elevator car-floor spins, and then lifts so you can dump your trucks down the ramp. It also makes fun noises while you lift and lower the elevator. The garage door opens and makes noise as well - it's fun to "park" your truck in the garage. The car wash section makes fun bubbly noises and then a noise that sounds like the dryer that you drive through at the real car wash. When you drive your truck into the elevator, it even makes the classic "ding ding.... ding ding" when you drive up the ramp. The only down side to this toy as with the Fast Tracks toy - is that there just aren't enough ramps. You can only build one full size ramp that goes from the top of the toy to the floor --- major bummer in my book. My son is learning how to lift gently to make the elevator go up, how to spin the elevator car-floor, how to build the cars, how to build the ramps - and he's doing it all by himself - but mommy just HAS to get in there too because it's really a fun toy. Even after he's gone to bed and I'm cleaning up toys, I find myself running the cars down the ramps as I clean! FUN FUN FUN!!!!
Outstanding, legendary Hollywood musical entailing a young girl's odyssey from her hometown of Kansas, Ill., to the mythical land of Oz, (and, it's been suggested, into womanhood). Originally conceived as a vehicle for the Marx Brothers, the project was re-cast when it was learned that only Harpo could hit the high notes in "Over the Rainbow." Almost based on a true story.
Not all books in this "Introducing" series are equally good but this one is a success. Most of the principles of evolutionary psychology are correctly represented within the limits of the available space, and the mildly entertaining illustrations make for easy reference. Every page introduces a new concept and can be read on its own. Whether this book is to be recommended as a first read in evolutionary psychology, is an open question. I dip into it from time to time to remind myself how fascinating and compelling a subject evolutionary psychology is. "Browsing evolutionary psychology" would be an apt title for this book.
This may be the best examination of Pentecostal and charismatic Christianity available in one volume. All aspects of the history and theology of the movement are examined respectfully and in great detail and its more bizarre manifestations are not covered up or ignored.This book's major drawback is its age. It desperately needs updating; a great deal has happened in Pentecostal and charismatic Christianity since 1988. The Trinity Broadcasting Network barely registers here, and such current Pentecostal and charismatic luminaries as T. D. Jakes, Clarence McClendon, Benny Hinn, Rod Parsley, and others do not show up at all.This book is as good a reference source for Pentecostalism as exists. If it were updated, it would be even better.
"Regular Expression - Pocket Reference" is just as high in quality as it's big brother ("Mastering Regular Expressions.")The book begins with a very brief review of regular expression concepts and patterns. For each language/tool, the book includes tables to reference the metacharacters, a reference for the API/syntax/library and four examples. A few of the languages have additional examples tailored specifically to that language.The languages/tools included are: Perl, Java, .NET, PHP, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, PCRE, Apache Web Server, vi and awk/sed/egrep. If you use a number of these, the book is a concise reference. If you only use one, you would be better served by printing out the relevant reference charts from the website of your language of choice.If you are learning about regular expressions or only going to buy one regular expressions book, I recommend the "Mastering Regular Expressions." If you are knowledgeable about regular expressions and just need a review or reference, this book does the job nicely.
I am currently using this wonderful book by Gail Stein, who is &quot;well-known language instructor who has taught in New York City public schools for over 20 years.&quot;The book contains 26 chapters, and is very well organized. It contains tons of useful vocabulary and lots of useful information on grammar, idioms, etc. There is an ample number of exercises with the answers, so that the learning process is an interactive one.I also like the book because of it's light-hearted approach. The lessons are fun, and her helpful and amusing comments make the book easy to read.Another great thing about this book is that it teaches you right from the beginning how to pronounce French words correctly, something that many French language books don't do. In addition, most of the french words are followed by their pronounciation in paranthesis, for example: l'ami (lah mee). Because of this, you will be able to learn how to speak and understand verbal French, not only read and write it.There is enough information in this book so that, with dedication and time, you can achieve an intermediate level of French using this book alone, which is what the book's goal is to do.The book is very inexpensive, and a great value. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn French at the beginner's level.
At the time I purchased this CD, I did not know much about Brahms or Schumann. After listening to this CD of the Brahms and Schumann Violin concerto and comparing it with other big name violinists, you can see that the quality of this violinist is nowhere near the greats, such as Perlman or Gil Shaham.The Japanese violinist in this album is unique in that he is blind. I found that to be really unique and inspiring for a classical musician. However, there are parts in this album where he is a little out of tune and the runs are not completely clean. Having said that, I would avoid purchasing this album.
Excellent cd for anyone that likes real country music. Gene Watson has been around a long time, but his voice never gets old
Of course, if you've seen the movie, you know it's good. But, contrary to what the advertisements about the DVD state, there is NO COMMENTARY of any kind. I don't know what happened, but I was disappointed with that. Other than that, the transfer is clean.
This game looks as gorgeous in hand as it does in the pictures. We read the outstanding reviews and my husband decided it was the perfect gift for me since I LOVE sudoku. And he is correct in a sense, though it is on the big and heavy side (the board is a large, square, thick piece of wood) - when not playing we would need to leave it out somewhere because it is too large to fit into our cupboards (though a game closet would be fine). Also if you lose a wooden bead the game will lose some of its aesthetic appeal (though it can still be played using a glass marble). But we're returning it for an entirely different reason --- my son is "color-blind" and can't play it. It was something we didn't really think about ahead of time and some games are less problematic than others (he struggles w/shades of red-green), so I just wanted to make a note in the reviews in case this is an issue for anyone else. There seem to be plenty of other "sudoku type" board games that aren't dependent upon discerning colors.
I bout this because I like fishing it was very boring to was couple of men an the boat and you can't fast-forward or rewind the DVD don't waste your money look elsewhere
I know the author and read the manuscript before it was published. I told Margaret that she could not wander so far off the actual records to write a novel about an well documented person like Eleanor of Aquitaine. Whereupon Margaret showed me her source material and told me that she had documented most events better than most professional historians could do.An excellent novel with elements of Magical Realism.
i got this box set about a week ago, and i am extremely satisfied with the set. the layout of everything is really professional. i was torn between getting the box set or ordering each cd induvidually, but i knewe this is going to be hard to come by, so i had to go for it. also own satanica and demigod, but the music behemoth put out back then was a little more black metal. for one reason or another, i like their older stuff better. very epic. Sventevith is the best in the box set. my personal favorite, at least. the exclusive live cd was supprisingly good. not great, but just good.i was expecting it to be something to sell you on, but i was pleasantly suprisedso in conclusion, if your buying this box set soully for the live cd, don't waste your money. definately worth the money otherwise. the production isn't that great, but that's what you have to expect. the production kind of makes the cd's what they are.
Not just a book for young people. this is a great, inspirational read. i have all of miss guy's books that pertain to the friends. read this book, and read 'edith jackson' and 'ruby' too! you will love them!
You are now entering the Twilight Zone.That's how Amelia Sachs must've felt at the crime scene. A murderer disappears from a room with no exit; a janitor, questioned by two cops, doesn't exist; a security guard watches as a man signs his name, but a short time later the name's not there. And that's just the beginning! By the end, you won't know if you're coming or going.Even Lincoln Rhyme, forensic scientist extraordinaire, is scratching his head over this one. "Too many sources to trace" is the evidence list's recurring theme. Rhyme's laser-sharp logic and intense focus on microscopic tangibles won't give him answers. He needs Sachs' intuitive abilities -- her 'wire' -- with people and surroundings. As they meld their respective strengths, Sachs comes to the fore as Rhyme's equal. Go Amelia!The murderer, a master illusionist (dubbed The Conjurer), helps keep the twists and turns coming nonstop by using magicians' methods (which turn out to be not so different from those of a detective). But Rhyme is a fast learner. With the help of apprentice illusionist, Kara, he uses The Conjurer's own methods against him.Then, just when everything seems about to be wrapped up, it all falls apart as The Conjurer executes his greatest performance. From there, it only gets better!The story drew me in most powerfully when Sachs must interview the world's most reluctant witness: Rhyme. He struggles (though sometimes not) to recall a traumatic event that we read about not 20 pages before. Now, as Sachs patiently wheedles the details from Rhyme's memory, we experience the event as Rhyme did. Heavy-duty tension in that scene.The concept of doubles struck me: The Conjurer as Rhyme's dark side personified; Kara as a young Amelia; The Conjurer and Kara's mentor, Thom and Jaynene, even Rhyme and Kara's 'mum' whose disabilities are reversed. Just a thought.There was only one short section when I felt things went a bit overboard. Other than that, as crazily convoluted as the plot is, it always seemed plausible.A mind-bending thriller that never lets up, peppered with intriguing facts about magic and magicians and a half teaspoonful of metaphysics, THE VANISHED MAN should appeal to a broad audience.Do not. Miss. This. Book.
Coming from a person who has had this cd since the day it came out(and bumped it constantly). I can tell you this is well worth it. From the dark lyrics that X raided masterminds, to the mad beats(that you can only fully experience with some nice subwoofers.
This movie was a lot of fun to watch for the first time in theaters and has been fun every time I have watched it since. The introduction of the wizarding world in conjunction with the "normal" world was well done. The characters, their interaction and development, and the great world of majic we've all dreamed of as kids has been brilliantly brought to life in this movie.
I really enjoyed this book. It brought out ideads and information that I never really thought about previously. Yes, Mr. Harpur uses author's named Kuhn and Massey for much of his information. But that just made me want to READ books by those authors and increased my desire to search out more information. A search online will reveal MANY sources that provide even more analysis concerning the way organized religion has twisted the truth about Christ. I find it interesting/amusing that those that attack Tom Harpur's ideas are the same ones that espouse the dogma of church teaching. Yet they offer no historical evidence or proof of Christ's existence. They simply perform a personal attack on the author because he's not "expert" enough to have his own opinion. Gee...are us common folk too stupid to be able to form our own thoughts, opinions, and theories too? Are we limited to accepting what "experts" tell us as well as the church? Oh yeah....I forgot...we aren't supposed to question the church because what they teach is "divinely inspired". Riiiiiight.
I absolutely adore this little &quot;book&quot; and look forward to it every new year. It is chock full of little tidbits and lore that is an absolute delight to peruse with its graphics that are detailed and lovely.This almanac is more diverse with its cultures and spiritual affiliations than any other; in other words, it concentrates on more religions than just the goddess ones. You can find a different holiday for every day, some in Sweden, some from England -- it's educational and facinating to learn new tidbits.Also along with the daily holidays, it gives the usual information on moon phase, astrological positions and tips on how to utilize this information to the fullest. Ever wonder if your little love spell is good on Friday? This tells you if it is and when it will be at its strongest.Along with the daily information, the book is chock-full of history lessons, spells, herbal infusions (topical or consumable) and magical information in general. I found great cookie recipies for my Summer Solstice party that was not only tasty but reflected the occasion along with some iced Strawberry Mint tea that was just a hit.I highly recommend this almanac if you've been looking everywhere for tips and information on magic and the craft in general. They not only offer your basic information, but contribute great ideas from other cultures and religions as well as history lessons from ancient Pagan pasts. A must for the serious practitioner.
I love historical fiction and have read many that were very good. In the best there is a blending of the authentic history with the modern so that modern audiences will enjoy the result. The idea is to show the hatreds and ignorance of the past, but not give them a fresh life in the modern world. Someone seems to have neglected to tell Sara Douglass this fact.I actually imported the book from the UK to read because it was not published here. After reading it I assumed that it was good judgment that prevented US publishers from putting this dreck out on the market. Obviously I was too generous in my assessment of US publishers. TOR should be ashamed of itself, pedaling this filth for cash. It is also interesting that it is ok to hate and slander women in the name of historical accuracy - but would they have published the book if it accurately portrayed medieval attitudes towards Jewish people -- I don't think so. Why is it ok to hate women for fun and profit ?The main character was filled with hate, for humans, for himself and for women in particular. There were pages and pages of misogyny. Even if this is a true reflection of attitudes at the time, it is not acceptable in a modern work. Especially when there are so many on the net who discuss this book (males) and don't even notice this element - as though it were acceptable, or just part of the warp and weft of entertainment. The real low point of the book is when one of God's angels comes to visit the main character and tells him not to waste time worrying over the pregnant woman he caused to have burned to death, because women should be used for procreation and pleasure and then flushed away like the excrement they are. Now obviously this gives you some pause about what kind of angel he is, but none the less to involve heaven directly in the hatred is repulsive and should never see the light of day. I have not read the other books and have no intention of doing so.
I liked this little book, and thought it would be very helpful to the woman to whom it seems to be addressed: a single woman who wants to travel but is afraid to go it alone. My only criticism is that some of the author's travel choices may be a bit too gritty for many of her readers. For example, I've traveled a lot, but I wouldn't consider staying in a bunk room in a youth hostel -- something highly recommended here. The author's premise is valid: go for it! And the early portion of the book aimed at getting women to overcome their fears is probably helpful. I just think few of the older women to whom this book is addressed are likely to sleep in their cars for weeks, or to take up some of the other unusual suggestions made by the author. Nevertheless, for women who want to travel alone and haven't done so yet, I strongly recommend this book.Gigi -- a 55-year-old travler
Let's cut to the chase: This novel is at least as good as Pressfield's "Gates of Fire" (an excellent book), but in two areas I feel it surpasses it. The first is that it is a faster moving story. The second is that although Manfredi, like Pressfield, clearly admires the spartans, he doesn't sanitize them quite as much. Both novels are written from the perspective of a slave, but Manfredi's Talos has feelings much more in line with what a slave would feel, I think. Both involve Thermopylae, but where that is the central theme of "Gates of Fire", here it is one occurance among many halfway through the story. Elsewhere in the reviews for this book, I found one reader who felt a little lost with a few of the characters. Manfredi does an excellent job of bringing to life historical figures such as exiled King Demaratus, but I admit that it may help to have a general understanding of the Persian war. Interestingly, the prose flows particularly well for a translation. If you like reading about ancient heroics, I highly recommend this novel.
I started with high hopes for this movie, but quickly found the characters to be nothing like any Marine I have known. The movie seems to purposeful portray marines as stupid, unorganized, unable to work together, without any purpose, regularly making mistakes that kill others, and then being losers when they finally get out of the military. At the end, there are simply no redeeming aspects of this movie. Don't waste your time on this one.
I have revised my review of this product because the xBox360 version of this title includes more tables including the classic "Medieval Madness" machine, which is one of the most expensive pinball machines ever made. It's really a shame that the producers have chosen to release multiple configurations of a game under the same title, yet have different features and functionality, and for this reason, I would advise against buying this product. Want the new tables including MM? Well you're out of luck on all other platforms except xBox. Booooooo!This review is for the PSP version.Being a huge pinball fan and having played all the tables featured in this game in real life, I can attest to how close they've managed to capture the gameplay and the feel. The only thing missing is a change machine that won't take my 1$ bill.There are a few minor issues I have though... The documentation is kind of minimal. There are many dynamics of the games you simply have to figure out - not all the game logic is outlined and what is, is very shallow. The PSP display is very small and you cannot always make out the minute details of the game board. For example, if extra ball is lit, it may be very difficult to tell where the extra ball target is - you surely can't read a little "extra ball when lit" tag in the playfield. Also some of the physics are predictable. For example, when a ball is kicked out of a hole, there isn't any randomizing of its nature. If you know a ball will kick out of a hole and you can trap it on an up-turned flipper, you will always be able to do that. The velocity or angle of the ball coming out of the drop will always be the same. This would normally be a very bad thing, but since the playfield is so small on the PSP, it probably evens things out and gives you time to make more accurate shots so I don't mind it that much. There's also a bug with the plunger... sometimes if you pull the plunger so that it's not all the way back, it will still rocket forward as if it is pulled all the way back. Another annoyance is if you meet the table goal in the middle of a game, a big message is plastered across the playfield, obscuring your view, which usually results in the ball draining just as you've been told you're doing well. But the worst thing about the game is if you accidentally hit the start button during gameplay, the "do you want to quit this game" menu pops up, but the game is not suspended so if you happen to accidentally hit that button, you've probably lost your ball. It should suspend the game at least.All in all though, this is a very good game and recommended for pinball fans. The main reason why I'm being critical is because this game does come very close to being the perfect pinball game for the PSP.
I bought this to use with a pocket PC when wi-fi isn't available. It's actually a pretty cool little gizmo. The modem is about 3x3x1 inches, and it operates using a battery so it does not need its own electrical outlet. Plug it into any nearby phone line; turn it on; turn on your pocket PC (if you have bluetooth); and dial up.It was a bit difficult to set up in the beginning. The included documentation is completely inadequate, and it took a technical support request to their website (which is often down) to get the full installation instructions from Socket. Once I had those, it only took about 5 minutes to adjust all of the settings and get it working.A good choice for someone who wants a small, portable exterior modem for a bluetooth-capable laptop or pocket pc.
I don't know, maybe it's me but I just can't seem to get overly excited about these MTV books. They all seem basically they same to me, all pandering to the MTV generation of Britney Spears non-readers. They must be doing a good job though because we keep buying their books.Fake Liar Cheat was okay. Nothing more than that. It reminded me of other MTV books that I've read in the past in that a lot of its plot lines and characters were unrealistic and underdeveloped. This book does its job of helping to pass the time, but anything beyond that is a stretch. If you're looking for good indie reading that is as believable as it is powerful, then I always recommend reading Dylan Raskin. These MTV books are just for passing time while waiting for the doctor.
This amulet is pretty powerful. It is so powerful, you will feel the "vibe" instantly. It is also very pretty and strong feeling. Definately made for the "long run"
I truly enjoyed this film. It was about a love that was so real and very special. It was very well done to.
I just received these earrings and they are very pretty. The 1/2 carat for each ear is a really nice size, and the color of the stones is wonderful, sort of an ocean/island blue, deeper than swiss and lighter than london blue topaz. The color in the photo is almost right if you can imagine adding a hint of yellow or green to the blue, causing it to look a little more medium aquamarine or, again, like ocean/island water. The faceting is nice and the earrings show good sparkle and allow light to come through, without diminishing the color. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
I've read a lot of series fiction and I have never seen one just continue to go from strength to strength like the In Death series. J. D. Robb/Nora Roberts is truly something else as a creative mind and a writer who can turn them out yet keep them fresh as spring daisies.The dialog in her books is first rate. I actually find myself smiling, laughing out loud and yes, wiping away a tear when reading this author. This isn't just mindless page turning, she pulls you into this world and makes you love these characters as much as she obviously does. Roarke and Dallas have one of the strongest love stories, truly the REAL THING, yet it doesn't get cloying or yucky, just moving and real right down to the bare bones. I think Roberts is a genius, a rare one indeed.And if you want a real treat, try one of the audiobooks. Susan Ericksen brings these characters alive, giving each an authentic voice with a genius of her own. Sure she has great material to work with, but she is remarkable in her talent for voices and character.
I loved this CD - I didnt listen to them when they came out- REALLY GOOD
The story, the scope and the characters of this sweeping story are tailor-made for a BBC adaptation. Where are the drama producers when you really need them?
What's not to like? This is well made, attractive, and keeps a can cold for hours. The rubber ring on top for a grip is a nice addition. Well worth the money, tho a bit expensive for an item that cost about a dollar to make in China.
This movie will not only intrigue, fascinate, educate and bewilder, it will also change your life (or at least how you look at it). It explores how all things synthetic from plastic surgery and indoor beaches to cryogenics are slowly becoming more natural to us. Yes, we are living in a superhyped techno-world, but the technological advances coming out everyday are changing more than just the speed of our internet connection. Whether these changes are good or bad, the film does not judge. This movie left me feeling confused, excited, scared, shocked and yet hopeful about what lies ahead for us. SYNTHETIC PLEASURES is a brilliant film but it doesn't give any answers. Instead, it forces us to think on our own. A great companion to this movie is Mark C Taylor's book, HIDING.
I gave this a perfect score because it's an excellent collection of hits.
I can only agree with the previous positive comments about this CD. Jeff Buckley had a wonderful voice which, teamed with his excellent song writing, made this a great album. But he is so little known, especially in the UK. Being 14 my generation aren't interested in decent music anyway, so I wouldn't expect them to care but I think Jeff is a massive (uncredited) influence on alternative music of the 90s and onwards. He should be remembered so.Don't quibble over this album. I bought it without hearing even just one track (Why? I'm not really sure) but I certainly didn't regret it. This is very powerful, very emotional haunting music. Just give it a little time.
Some people apparently find Doctorow hard to read, especially his riskier works, like City of God. All I can say is, that the leaps Doctorow takes in literary style don't simply raise the bar in terms of what constitutes literary genuis, but in payoff to the reader a hundredfold. I find some of his other books, like The March, pedantic, as if he is lowering his standards in order to keep the Ragtime readership happy. City of God, like Book of Daniel, will make you weep over its sheer literary genuis, and cause you to pine for true artists who dare to be better, despite what the marketplace may accept or hail as "great." I believe that Doctorow is one of the finest--if not the finest--writers of the last few decades. Remember that genuis rarely goes noticed in one's own lifetime. If you find City of God difficult to read, I ask you to do this: stop trying to understand it. Read it and enjoy its brilliance, then wait for it all the meaning you glossed over to hit you like a ton of bricks sometime near the end. Then as you devour the book a second and third time, soaring with its meaning and resonant delight, you will realize that we don't always have to "get" things at their inception, and that illumination which comes in its own time generally brings with it far greater and profound understanding.
I showed this movie to my confirmation class and thought it was very well done, thought provoking and insightful.
I pity the bandwagon bunch that bought toxicity first. I was going to come up with something profound, a review that avid readers could really sink their teeth into...but its all been said, much better then i could ever articulate. So I'm just going to say that I love this cd so much I'd pleasure myself with it if I could...whoops...
I appreciate a simple message, simple & succinctly stated. But this "book" is a waste of even the short time it takes to read it, especially if you have already read Wild at Heart. Eldredge continues, but does not advance one iota, a central theme he stated in WAH: there is a great battle between good & evil, between God & Satan, a battle which started with Eden's fall, and we all play our part in it. I probably should have issued a spoiler alert, b/c I have now just told you everything that Eldredge has to say in Epic. Oh, you can enjoy his constant movie references, if you like, but even they are re-hashed: we get it, John, you like Braveheart and Gladiator and similar movies. But there is virtually no substance here, at least no substance that is not covered in WAH. I wish I could recommend this book more highly.
I found The Village to be a really good scary movie, although it doesn't take much to scare me, with a really beautiful, funny love story in it. Even though it was easy to guess the suprise, the movie had more going for it. It told the tale of people who wanted to preserve their way of life in the best way they knew how. If you don't compare this movie to all of M. Night's other works you will find yourself pleasantly suprised by this film.
I have been a data application developer for over ten years. I've read, on average, two technical books per year on theory or practical application. This book has been my favorite for a number of reasons:1) It covers the topics that are necessary to develop data applications in a .NET environment.2) It gets to the point and doesn't waste your time needlessly.3) It has concrete examples that are applicable to many situations with detailed descriptions.4) It fully addresses the .NET focus on disconnected data centering around the Dataset. Making the paradigm switch from ADO to ADO.NET can be a daunting task. The sequence and examples of the book put all of the pieces of the puzzle together and allow you to start thinking in terms of disconnected data and not just DataReaders.Data is the foundation of most every business application and it's essential to have a full understanding of the database/application interaction. Taking ADO.NET for granted is a common mistake, but spending time understanding to movement and manipulation of your data will result in a more stable and successful overall data application.Mr. Wildermuth has done a great job. Highly recommended.
I never bothered to see this in the theater because I couldn't really accept a PG-13 rated Terminator. I understand that that is the money rating, but come on. I'm actually glad I bought this the R-rated version because I really enjoyed it. The action was good and really well shot. Overall it was really a good flick. It wasn't the epic that I was hoping for, but it is definately a solid 4 star action flick.***MILD SPOILER***I hadn't heard anything specific about this movie so when the T-800 came out looking exactly like an early-mid 80's Arnold I was pleasantly shocked because during the marketing of this they made such a point to say that he wasn't going to be in it when I saw him I got goose bumps. I realize it was a CG head (or at least face) but that was pretty sweet.*****NO MORE SPOILERS*****All in all I recommend it for any fans of the first two Terminators. It's at least worth a rental. I do hope the extended version that everyone seems to be talking about gets released. I'd like to see that.
I've owned this brush since 2003. It's now December of 2012. I washed and cared for this brush carefully over the years. Until yesterday, a simple wash in soapy water would make the brush come back to its original condition. Now, I see that the bristles are taking on some wear and tear. Not only that, and this is all about me, sometimes, I have not cooled down enough from my workout and shower and when I apply the foundation, it seriously clumps to the bristles. Sigh. I had to get out a stronger grease cutting detergent for that. So, now I am back in the market for this brush-ok, it should have been replace a year ago. I do have one brush on hand from another kit that I purchased, I just hate to break up the kit! Overall, the brushes that I have from Bare Escentuals have had a long and productive life with me. The other brush that I've had since 2003, the double end eye-shadow / eyeliner brush is getting to the replacement point as well. Overall, it's best not to over load the brush OR your face with too much powder--if you want to look flawless.I know that there are complaints here and the the BE site on how this brush sheds. Honestly, they must have done something as a cheaper solution in the past few years, or reviewers are really using this brush harshly. I'd bet on the former though, and having said that, if one is not happy with their brush, they should not only post, but call BE and talk with customer service.
The first 20 or so pages are actually the hardest hitting.DeSoto's team has compiled, by going thru them, a list of the administrative steps that someone wanting to legally register a small business would have to go through in a half dozen developing countries. Haiti, as an example, has about 150 steps, jumping from ministry to ministry, and visiting many several times, before you can be legally registered. Unbelievable stuff!His point? Nobody bothers, and nobody bothers to register land or building ownership either. This results in ample scope for graft by corrupt officials. But, mostly, this makes business relationships outside your immediate circle very difficult: how can you sell or insure something which you can't prove you own? How can you buy land without formal land ownership information? How can you get a bank loan without collateral? So the vast majority of citizens are forced to eke out a living, with none of the opportunities for entrepreneurship which we take for granted in our societies. According to DeSoto, those people are just as capable, and certainly have more reasons to be motivated, as many of us. They just have no opportunity, due to systemic legal failures.Only the rich can afford the time to play by all these well-meaning rules, or the money to bribe themselves out of them. The poor just end up in extra-legal shantytowns. See Zimbabwe's recent little ghetto cleanups for one possible result.There is also a comparison of these issues with the slow establishment of formal property rights in America, in the 17th thru 19th century. The point being that these problems are not new and are not impossible to solve either. In fact, the book is almost worth reading just for its look at that particular facet of European and American history.
Many reviews state that Shark Tale is a rip off of "Finding Nemo", in reality I liked the movies about equal and they are very different. Shark Tale offers something that Finding Nemo doesn't, an underwater world where "Jessica Shrimpson", "Cod Stewart" live and places such as "The Gup" and "Old Wavy" can be found. I think the underwater puns throughout the movie are very entertaining. Finding Nemo was a bit plain underwater because they depicted it as real underwater life while Shark Tale gives the sea it's own world, totally different.Oscar is a small fish in a big pond that wants to live the high life and mistakenly becomes known as the "shark slayer" which puts him at the top of his league. His adventure through the movie is very entertaining for adults and children. I believe children are more entertained by Shark Tale because of the underwater life being so much like real life where Nemo had a cold feeling being in a huge ocean with an occasional piece of coral.Shark Tale is definitely a DVD buy to watch over and over!
As a lover of history and social science, I very much looked forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, I found it to be replete with nauseating stereotypes, platitudes, over-generalizations and poorly-drawn conclusions about the various generations.The entire premise of this book is wholly fabricated by a brash author looking to make money, not a genuine contribution to the field.
I could tell this was a great pan even though mine arrived broken - and it was the last one so it couldn't be replaced. I have other pieces of this collection and they are nice to cook in and hold up well to washing. Nice color too.
Has anyone ever portrayed the Nice Man Gone Crazy as well as Vincent Price? Of course not, and in House of Wax, Price is in top form as a loving sculptor who emerges from a fire with a different, errr, method for creating his wax sculptures. I don't know about you, but just the thought of being alone in a wax museum after dark gives me the creeps. Add a dose of homicidal mania, and there's your recipe for terror.Most people will find this movie creepy even today; those who love camp will enjoy the prolonged ping-pong paddle scene catered to the orginal 3-D audience.All in all, one of Vincent Price's best films, proving once again that nobody goes horribly insane quite like Vincent Price.
I do think this is a very poor book.The author's style is really poor.Secondly, he expresses his strong national socialist and racists views throughout the whole book. The scenes descriptions are therefore very annoying and the book becomes boring. Without any meaningful reflection or analyses.The only interest in this book is the opportunity to read one fanatical SS's mind and way of thinking. It really fits their reputation. Even after the war, the author still believes the waste superiority of the enemy numbers defeated Germany. How can this be?I would rather recommend readers to choose instead "the forgotten soldier "from Guy Sajer or "Seven days in January".This book is not worth buying, I'll send you mind for free if you want.Best regards.
I wanted a portable DVD player that I could prop up on the treadmill at the gym and watch movies while I burned away the calories. The Sony does the job admirably.I must admit, I didn't do a lot of research on this purchase. I started by buying a $79 special, which worked okay, but felt kind of flimsy. So I returned it and got the Sony.One thing that seemed surprisingly similar between the cheap unit and the Sony was picture quality. Resolution just doesn't seem to be great on these units. But since you're only looking at an 8" screen, the picture does appear crisp, with decent contrast. The screen is glossy, and prone to glare, but it hasn't been a problem, even in the brightly lit gym.The screen will swivel and fold into a tablet, with all controls within easy reach. The player comes with a remote (a big one for such a small player), but I haven't even unwrapped mine. I suppose it might come in handy if you used the player's outputs to a large screen and home theater system.[UPDATE] I wanted to finish watching the disc in the player, and rather than taking it out and changing players, I just plugged it into the inputs on the front of my TV, found the remote, and I had a full functioning DVD player. It even picked up where I left off in the movie I was watching.Battery life is close to 5 hours, about twice that of most similar players. An AC adapter/charger, and auto adapter are included. Headphones are not, but ports are provided for two sets.I've heard that an extended warranty is recommended, but the player comes with a 12 months parts and labor (as opposed to the typical 12/3 terms). I figure if it breaks after a year, there'll be something slicker and nicer available to spend my toy budget on.So far I am quite happy with this player. It fits perfectly on the treadmill, and helped pass the hour long wait at the doctor's office. A nice diversion for automotive or motorcycle passengers, too.Great battery life, swiveling screen, and pleasing design make the Sony Portable DVD Player worth considering. Oddly enough, Sony released a 7" Walkman DVD player about the same time. I can't figure why they would compete with themselves. I like the one I got because it seems more versatile, and the screen is better protected when closed. It sounds, from the description, that the `Walkman' might have better audio features.
I am a clutch fan from the beginning and I must say when I first heard this album I was thuroughly disappointed. I had come to expect so much from them because of their first 2 records, in my eyes this one just didn't measure up. I liked the first 4 songs and that was about it. I didn't listen to this album for about 3 years and then I decided to givfe it another chance. The more I listened to it, the more I liked it. It is still not one of my favorite Clutch records, but it definetly is a very good album. Also it has one of the best Clutch songs ever written on it "The Soapmakers". Other standouts are; the title track and "Eight Times Over Miss October"
I first read this book when I was 10 and in the 5th grade.Ok so I lied, I didn't read it, my teacher read it to me.But I still liked it. Its an interesting (though somewhat predictable) book. I was at the library today and found a copy and checked it out and read it again. I always loved this book, and has been one of my favorite all time books. Very good, easy to read, kind of scary, but not too scary. I wish they had made this into a movie though. One thing caught my eye, I never pictured Heather (the girl who befriends Helen) as having a mullet like she does on this cover. Oh well.
The script is a soap opera. And the slicing of the chronology was an attempt to hide that fact. I also hated all the gratuitous and melodramatic guy fights, all the guns, all the blood. Fine actors (as these actors all are) are too often put in the position (or put themselves in the position!!!) of having to work with really awful scripts. Melissa Leo's performance really shines, and seems to have been almost totally ignored in both the handing out of awards and in so many of the reviews of this theatrical and horribly manipulative movie.
Boy are these bad!Bit into the first one.Pasty stuff inside with a slightly crunchy cover.Spit it out immediately.They taste like some unidentifiable chemical and smell bad.My dog ate a few small bites I cut off then refused any more.I feel bad donating these to the food bank but off they go.
These days, opera is not something a lot of people watch, but all those awful "Mostly Mozart" things suggest that people can stand Mozart. I won't argue: Mozart is fabulous. But The Magic Flute is a work that absolutely anyone without a heart of stone can adore. The libretto is a bit silly (depending on your interpretation, of course), but the music is truly lovely and the story is hard to dislike.I won't review it in a more technical musical direction, because lots of people have already done this -- and note that all but the idiots give it 5 stars. I'll just talk about why you parents should buy this particular film version right now. And you non-parents should buy it too (and you'll soon BE parents, I should warn you, because, you know, it's all about love, and not in a Platonic sense...).I suppose this stuff about it being for everyone could be said about a lot of operas -- "La Boheme" leaps to mind, perhaps. But I got my toddler son to watch this, and he passes up the usual SpongeBob and the like to "watch Papageno 'gain, Daddy!" You parents, you understand how striking this is.Is it just the opera? Sure, that's a large part of it. But Bergman's version is deliberately aimed at a very wide audience, and Bergman was a film genius. It seems clear he wanted to make Die Zauberfloete [re-spelled because no umlauts] accessible, exciting, open to lots of people. He put it in Swedish for his TV audience, but the subtitles are easy and your little kids will have no trouble following without them -- trust me on this one, my Sam knows no Swedish (nor do I).The core, in some respects, is Papageno, the natural man who really keeps this all grounded and coherent (rather than abstractly allegorical Enlightenment stuff that nobody really buys much any more). And this is quite possibly the finest recording of Papageno ever made, with or without video: Hakan Hagegard, who soon became one of the superstars of opera, is jaw-droppingly wonderful. He's fun, he's funny, he never panders or gets overly broad. He seems like someone you'd like to know, not for his great conversation or intellect but because he's a truly good person and because he's utterly charming. Sam (my 2-year-old) is convinced that this film is called "Papageno," and frankly he doesn't give a damn about any of the other characters.Now ask yourself: what sort of film, in Swedish (or any non-English language), has a character who is so mesmerizing that American toddlers will adore him, yet is completely wholesome and without a single fault you could point to? Okay, I admit it, Papageno taught my son to spit which has been a small disagreement, but other than that.... Right. I didn't think you could come up with one. So check this film out.Besides, they say that Mozart is good for brain development, so even if you're an uncultured Philistine and must flee the room, put this on while your little kids are there and maybe they will grow up to be brilliant unlike you. More likely, of course, you will be as caught as they, and you will sit and watch and LISTEN -- because the music is simply as good as it gets: Mozart's finest hour.
Milwaukee, again, has produced a superior product. The tool is very handy and really does work in tight quarters, although I use it for a lot of different applications. The trigger is one of the best I have used for controlling the speed of the drill. It gives you a feel for the speed and is very precise. It fits in your and perfectly and has never bogged down. Ever. It is a litle pricey but it's a drill that is used a lot. In no way is it limited to tight quarters.
I spent most of this book wondering why Gruen chose to intersperse her primary story of a young man who found himself thrust into the circus life in 1931 with the musings of that same man at the age of 93. The story of how Jacob came to be in the circus and what happened to him there seemed like enough to me, and Jacob's aged voice seemed unnecessary. At the end of the book, though, I realized why she gave us both perspectives, and could hardly argue with her narrative device, as the closure it provides works so well.
It was 1981, I was a UCLA grad student sharing a house with friends in West LA. I'll never forget waking up one morning, with that soul-warming SoCal sunshine coming into the screened patio, and an FM radio station playing this album. I stopped everything and just sat on the sofa, listening to this music, entranced. Afterward I had to go out and buy it, and it has always been one of my favorite albums, something magical, something uniquely special. The music is indescribable, and the guitar playing simply phenomenal. I have 100s of albums, but nothing even similar to Dawn Dance; it's a little like Oregon, but more melodic. A couple of years ago I asked the same question as another reviewer here--what happened to Steve Eliovson? How could anyone so incredible, artistically, just disappear? It's great to see that his only album has at least come out on CD, but the distributor needs to find a way of letting the world 'rediscover' it again.
This is a decent Blues disc from Willie Trice, with the following songs standing out: "I've Had Trouble", "New Careless Love Blues" and, especially, "Troublesome Mind", which has different guitar work than I've heard on any other Blues song. The problem with this album is that the rest of the songs just don't have the same quality as the three I just mentioned. If you are a serious collector who wants a cheap Blues cd, buy this one.
I must admit that I write this review mainly in response to the one other review that this book has recieved. I must first state that I find his comment on the author's &quot;energetic enthusiasm to present uncloaked her feminist vision of procreative liberty...&quot; to reveal HIS perverse evaluation of women that leaves ME shocked and disturbed. Is it not more perverse for women to cloak and hide abortions, to have them done in unsafe and unsanitary conditions, putting their life on the line to avoid the shame and stigma men like the other reviewer bring? Not only does he misunderstand the basic concept behind abortions, but he gravely misunderstands abortions in general. All his talk of mutilated fetuses is ridiculous. 88% of abortions are performed before the second trimester, when the fetus is no bigger than about two inches long. That is hardly the image he conjures up, is it? It is shocking in this day and age that women are still not afforded the responsibility of determining what happens to their own bodies. It is our most basic, simple, and profound human right, and men like the other reviewer would deny us that right. The other important thing is to remember that every child born should be a wanted child; until that is possible in the case of every pregnancy (which will never happen)we must keep abortion safe and legal. So in conclusion, do not allow your opinion of this book to be tainted by misinformed opinions.
This book is apparently (whether actually or not) a reproduction of a little notebook, handwritten with handpainted illustrations, containing the Victorian "code" of flowers such as used in creating tussy-mussies. The notebook includes a dedication indicating it is a birthday gift from a husband to his wife. It is a nice little reference, especially if you enjoy Victoriana and/or flowers. It would make a nice addition to a gardener's gift basket or a selection of quaint Victorian or neo-Victorian gifts.
I tried to save a few dollars and purchased this one instead of the one made by Pampered Chef. The lid is not a perfect fit. The meat dries out too fast.
This is the first time I saw the complete series and really enjoyed it. I had other shows on the same time like He-Man and Ghostbusters I'm glad to see the series actually ended.
I was looking for more black lights for my son's room and found these on sale. I purchased 4 and mounted them as one chain. They provide great coverage along a 121" wall with only one cord plugged into a wall power outlet. The included swivel brackets work great and I mounted them 1" down from the ceiling on a 45 degree tilt. I wish I would have purchased more at the time given the sale price was under $10 each delivered due to super saver shipping. I should have purchased 20 of these things! I want to mount some under cabinets and other areas of the house. A few reviewers rated the product one star due to shipping issues. Not fair, the lamps themselves are great. Thankfully mine arrived safe and sound. I will say that out of the 4 one bulb is a bit gimpy, not as strong.
I really can't express how much I disliked this movie. It came to me highly recommended, so perhaps I went into it with high expectations, but I was definitely underwhelmed.The story is about two young Irish men who move to London looking for fame and fortune and instead find themselves hustling older gay men to survive. During the course of their work, they inadvertently stumble over a murdered "Queen"--the first dead gay guy. They then find themselves caught up in a caper to discover the rumored "bed of bread", a bed supposedly stuffed with cash. In the process, they leave a trail of dead gay men in their wake.The already anemic plot is stretched so thin that at times it practically disappears. The film is populated by a series of grossly stereotyped characters, but at least it's an equal opportunity offender--everyone from Jews, to Arabs, to little people, to blacks, to lesbians, to gay men can be disgusted by their portrayals in this schlock fest.The movie sells itself as a hilarious British comedy, but I didn't find myself laughing once as I suffered through the full eighty-four minutes. Comparisons to John Waters are only valid if they refer to his more recent (and foul) offerings such as "A Dirty Shame".If you enjoy tasteless jokes and stereotyping, then you may enjoy this movie. If you prefer subtlety, smart humor, good acting, competent direction, or intelligent writing, look elsewhere.
Specialized trivial games, in their defense, are difficult to construct. For a niche audience like Star Wars fans, levels of fandom vary so widely that it's hard to establish a baseline of what can be considered "general knowledge" that any reasonable player might know -- partly because it's unlikely the game's authors are big fans themselves, and partly because people who consider themselves "fans" will have widely ranging levels of obsession about the films.This difficulty becomes readily apparent once you start playing the game; someone who has seen the movies once will find the difficulty of many questions just about right, but anyone who owns the videos and can quote favorite lines more obscure than "I've got a bad feeling about this" or "May the Force be with you" will quickly split the questions into two categories: "All to easy" and "That's impossible, even for a computer!"That said, the designers have done about as well as could be expected with this game. The playing pieces are absolutely gorgeous, and whoever did the layout for the board has a terrific sense both of color balance and of significant scenes from the Star Wars films. The use of an electronic R2-D2 instead of dice is clever, though dice would probably be faster to roll. The box is durable (mine has survived two moves without a scratch) and the game should last a long time, provided the questions don't bore you to tears (I've answered as many as 30 without faltering) or slam you completely against a wall.
This was a great transition cup because of the big nipple-like spout, easy flow, and handles. This cup is not leak free, will dribble out a little, even when new.The most negative thing about this product is all the parts. It has seven (7) pieces (the cup, the collar, the nipple, the silicone insert, the plastic insert, the handles, and the cap). It's a bit much if you ask me. We started my son on this when he was 9 months, but at 13 months he can use other sippies now that aren't such a production to clean and put together. That being said, the Born Free cup did serve its purpose by training him off the bottle.
Hey!Check out Cloe.She is so cool.Like I have stated in all my other reviews(all the princess ones)Cloe is appropriate for little girls in this collection.Just so you know,the clothes really aren't that skimpy causeI make skirts out of barbie clothes and cut mine so short theybarely cover the behind of the doll.Just so you know, this doll is totally cute.And, I also recommend it.Love always,Ruby TuesdayPs-support me by putting at the bottom of your review"I support Ruby"
Three words, WTF? . After watching this movie, I thought about joining the armed forces so I could go exact some type of mindless violence on some unsuspecting individual I did not know in some foreign country with an unpronounceable name. Not only am I a fan, I now feel as if my sole mission in life is to educate those individuals who think they are fans, along with those whose first encounter with the Transformers will be this film, as to what they should expect, and more importantly what they should accept. I have traveled around the globe, bid vigorously on eBay, and sacrificed much in an attempt to acquire the toys I need to create the ultimate collection. Not a complete collection, but a collection that will one day, hopefully, be part of a Transformer display of museum quality. I have learned some Japanese, and manipulated 2 of my siblings into learning the language and the culture of the creators so that I might create a seamless conjunction of timelines to aid in my mission; (you may have even read one of their reviews.)This travesty of a movie was so terrible, I believe many viewers were left in such denial as to be unable to provide rational reviews. Many fans wanted this movie to be so great so badly they must have become delusional, their minds creating the story they wanted to see. I challenge everyone who saw this movie to ask themselves, their friends, what happened during the movie. You will find yourselves drawing a blank. Those who have seen this flick more than once have done so only because subconsciously your trying to fill in the blank. Think about it.I have, and while I can quote lines from the 1st movie verbatim, I have a hard time remembering anything about this movie other than the scenty, dangly thing hanging on Bumblebee's mirror...you know what I am talking about. Bah weep grahn ah weep ninee bahm. Another issue I have, not just with the movie, is the latest obsession with every Autobot Leader being Optimus Prime, and every Decepticon Leader being Megatron. If you are going to use these names you had d@#m well better put them in the movie. Optimus was a basic rig and Megatron was a gun. And, do not make excuses about mass to size ratios and gun laws. Anyone who has ever seen the Transformers knows that part of their arsenal of advanced technology includes mass shifting and subspace shunts. Their aliens for crying out loud, but they are not bugs. Furthermore, the question everyone should have been asking was "Where did Optimus Prime's trailer go?" Not, "Why does he have a mouth?"Anybody involved in filmmaking or entertainment knows that a good story always has underlying themes. With the Transformers there were several. The proverbial battle between good and evil, the integration of biblical undertones, the political influence of the time; The Cold War, (why do you think the good guys had blue eyes and the bad guys had red eyes?) Even the names meant something. The name Optimus Prime, for example, is derived from the Latin words for best, and another meaning 1st in occurrence, and Megatron, mega meaning large/great/powerful and tron meaning machine. This movie does not possess any of these aspects. In layman's terms...it suc?ed big time.Yes, I am a '80s child as well. I watched the cartoons and had the toys. Heck, I still have many of them still in the box; OCD. The whole machine to robot thing has always been awesome. Even now, I have some hope that the sequel will adhere to the spirit of the legend Transformers has become.The special effects were great, the actors too. Unfortunately, there were too humans and not enough Transformers. The storyline behind this movie blew, and the movie ended with a whimper, not a bang. Too much of this movie was spent on the wrong thing, much like Deep Impact. This movie is supposed to be about TRANSFORMERS. The plot had massive holes through it, especially in the final scene.I would strongly recommend that original fans of the 80's cartoon stay away from this movie. In addition, I also recommend that you write to Hasbro and tell them to get it together. If you see it you will be disappointed. The 80s cartoon movie was so much better than this in terms of storyline. Michael Bay is now on my list of most hated directors. Brian Goldner allowed Transformers to be distasteful and obnoxious, though I am not surprised considering his track record and lack of interest in the Transformers until he realized just how much money they can generate.Why throw away your money so recklessly? That is the question you should ask yourself. Do yourself a favor...rent it. 'Till all are one.
It is a pity it is a live there because the distribution(casting) is excellent - three main protagonists are everything made exceptional - A very beautiful reference with that of Argo Quadri with Leyla Gencer, Gianni Raimondi and Cornell Mac Neil - Christian ( Frane)
The Motorola Phone Tools 4.0 software worked perfectly with my RAZR V3 phone. It quickly installed and updated and walked through driver installation on XP. Once the phone was connected it performed all functions without any problems. The software also remembers several profiles which is handy since we have multiple phones for the family. Finally, the software uses standard cables to interface to the phone unlike some products that require a special cable keyed to the software.
REally well done prosections in colored pencil of animals in movement. My 6 year old is riveted. 50 large pages of everything from flies to whales. Unlike any other book I've found on animal anatomy, and I've looked and looked.
Huge grossing movies are usually far from the best nowadays but I kept hearing no this really is great. This movie is the pinnacle of average Saturday morning cartoon/Full House humor aka non-entertaining humor. The plot doesn't matter cause you know what's gonna happen. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Disney/Pixar hater; I just caught a little Toy Story on Disney and I could still enjoy it even though I had watched it many many times. The only jokes that made me giggle were the times the blue fish called Nemo Fabio and 1 more that most people won't get.
I was very anxious to read this book, but the hype outdid the reality. I have loved all of Cornwell's fiction and believed this would be in the same style, even though it is non-fiction. Wrong! I have 2 major complaints about this book.First, as other reviewers have said, she seems to have made her decision as to who the Ripper was and then pulls together evidence that supports her claim. She talks repeatedly about how little evidence there was and how hard it was to find much of it. Since it was so hard to find what she does have, how much evidence did she not find - evidence that could clear Stickart's name? When writing fiction, the author needs to first determine the solution and work backwards, building evidence for that ending. Real life doesn't work that way.Second, the writing does not flow well. She bounces from subject to subject with little or no break. Many times I found myself flipping back through the pages, trying to find when she changed thoughts and to what.All in all, this is an interesting study into the Jack the Ripper case. However, I feel Cornwell has gone too far in saying she has, hands down, solved the mystery
I took a class on Dealing with Difficult People and the instructor showed us the video. I had so many insights that I knew my notes wouldn't do me justice for future reference. I'm glad that this book was available. It goes over the video in detail. I still would like to find and purchase the video, but in the meantime this book is an excellent resource.
John Heihardt's classic is a problematic read to be sure. On the one hand, Neihardt was a sympathetic interlocutor who elicited a fascinating account from an extraordinary man who lived through several major episodes in late-19th-century history. On the other hand, his poetic pretensions led him to rearrange and dress up that testimony, adorning it with his own mediocre neo-Romantic insight, and altogether distorting the historical and cultural record.Readers of Black Elk Speaks may be surprised to look up key episodes in the volume in the raw transcripts of their conversations, only to find that they were entirely invented by Neihardt.Now, on the one hand, I have a certain amount of sympathy for Neihardt, who worked very hard in order to preserve and present a document of great power and importance. He was writing at a time when it was still widely believed that the Lakota were a "primitive people," "savage," and "uncivilized," and he labored to find an audience for their experience, with considerable success in the long run.That may explain his transformation of the plain-spoken style of the transcript into a somewhat maudlin kind of free verse, seeming to my eyes to be modeled after Goethe's "Sorrows of Young Werther" or the American transcendentalists.But it does not excuse some of Neihardt's wholesale inventions - especially his deep distortions of Black Elk's "Great Vision," which altogether inverted the sense and meaning of the experience, coercing it into a frame that Neihardt apparently found more congenial to his sentiments.The testimony itself is wondrous and invaluable, and I refer the interested reader to DeMallie's "The Sixth Grandfather" instead of "Black Elk Speaks." "The Sixth Grandfather" consists of the annotated publication of the transcripts of Black Elk's conversations with Neihardt, and presents his perspective in a much more accurate way.
Dead Like Me is one of the best shows ever and its second season is even better than the first one. For those who still don't know the show, it is about Georgia Lass, an eighteen year old girl who suddenly dies when a toilet seat coming from the Mir space station crashes on her. Then she is recruited as a Grim Reaper.The first season was about the death of a beloved and how people try to deal with it, while the second season is different: Georgia has been dead for a year, and her family has slowly learnt to deal with her disappearance. The storyline seems to be about characters finding who they really are rather than how they cope with death. Most of the characters see their lives change:Daisy's soul searching, Reggie grows up, Joy moves on while George tries to keep an eye on her family, but quite remotely...This season is amazing: the show is shrewdly written and some of the story lines are really moving - for example, the episode "Send in the Clown", in which Mason has to reap a little girl's father on her birthday, or all the episodes showing Joy trying to move on with her life while facing her divorce. The actors are all brilliant, because they try to be as subtle as possible, to convey emotions without overdoing it (but this is no sitcom after all).In this show, death is not really treated as a big deal, there is always a detail that will make you laugh (as George's nickname: "Toilet seat-girl"). To me, this show is as good as TV can get, and even if it was cut down in its prime - as Georgia's character was, it will soon become a classic.As a French girl, I think that the DVD could at least have been subtitled in English, because even if I understand English quite well, I missed some of the lines and it did bother me (a lot)!! MGM is lucky the show is excellent, because as far as the DVD goes, it is not good, and its promotional extra features are dull.
Why is it that every time a new game system comes out (in this case, the mighty PS2), companies flood the market with poor games, sometimes with graphics which would be a letdown on an OLDER machine, sometimes with gameplay that will put a razor to your wrist, and sometimes games that just out and out suck on all fronts?While Ephemeral Fantasia may not be the worst game ever made, it is certainly a disappointment, especially when one considers the fact that it was released by Konami. I tried, I mean, I REALLY tried to get into this game, but it is just horrible. Yeah, the minigames are fun (hey, I gave it 2 stars), but please, PLEASE steer clear of this travesty of an RPG. I want my money back...
I installed this in a 2001 Ford Focus and it didn't fit that well. I had to grind and cut it to eventually make it work. I've used Scosche products before with no problems so it may fit your vehicle but not a 2001 Focus.
I have used this program for years and love its WYSWYG approach. Now I use WP 11. Word is also a very good program but fails to add the essectial Reveal Codes, which I cannot do without. Why Word will not or cannot add RC is beyond me. Obviousley it is not that easy or they would have done so by now.
If you own a Bonsai, or are thinking about getting one you shoudl have MORE than one Bonsai book. No Bonsai book is perfect, but this one has great information and pictures that help illustrate what the Bonsai is supposed to look like and what you shoudl be doing. Save your Bonsai and get this book! :)
If I could give negative stars to this set put out by Gaiam, I would. In the description on its web site, it says it includes "a pair of artfully crafted, stowable nonslip birch disks." The disks being used by David Dorian Ross and Daisy Lee Garripoli in the accompanying DVD do appear to be birch. However, the disks actually sold in this set are 100% man-made plastic. They are cheaply made and a total waste of money and earth's resources. I'm fairly certain they would not support a great deal of weight (I am not a big person and they flattened out under my weight). The included DVD contains a 30+/- minute tutorial led by David Dorian Ross (Daisy Lee-Garripoli is there mainly to demonstrate use of the disks and talks very little), followed by a routine with David that is about 15 minutes long (and, even though he has put out several videos, he still hasn't learned to mirror cue, so when he says "raise your left knee," you are moving opposite to what he is doing). The DVD is chaptered, but the chapters aren't listed on a menu, so the only way to get to the routine is to skip forward through the chapters. While real birch disks could probably enhance your practice, these crappy plastic ones won't, so don't waste your time or your money with this piece of garbage product. Gaiam should be embarassed for polluting the earth with it- anyone who buys it will have no choice but to promptly deliver it to the nearest landfill.
It was supposed to bright more than the regular ones. Well, the regulars give more light than this one. I just threw away my money. I recommend not to buy this product. It's the worst I've been with
"A Short History of Germany" has good information but is not well-written. There are many points where I had to the internet and search for the particular topic being presented in the book, just to understand it better. It tends to go all over the place and does not comprehensively or completely explain much of the history. I frequently had to stop and search back to find out who the author was talking about and how he fits in with the history. If this occurred once or twice, I'd chalk it up to it being an oddity. But in fact, it happened too many times for me to count. I liked the information and it did prompt me to read in more depth on certain times and topics, but I could not recommend this as a good book to read.
I don't understand what the problem with this show is! Having listened to the original cast album, I found the transfer from the page to the stage absolutely delightful.As a resident of Minneapolis, where our Children's Theatre Company has staged two Dr. Seuss works, I find the concept terrific. I've seen the CTC production of THE 500 HATS OF BARTHOLOMEW CUBBINS four times, and have enjoyed it every time. (Their adaptation of THE GRINCH, however left a lot to be desired.)As a teacher with a fascination for Children's literature, and a teacher, who's had the pleasure of teaching struggling readers through the work of Dr. Seuss, especially HOP ON POP, GREEN EGGS AND HAM and THE CAT IN THE HAT, I've seen the happiness, the joy and the sense of accomplishment children feel after mastering these classics.And anyone who's seen the TNT biography/fantasy, IN SEARCH OF DR SEUSS knows that the man has deep meanings hidden inside his art and writing. Therefore, the concept for a stage musical that brings everything together is a great one.From the moment I heard The Cat in the Hat introduce the show, I was fascinated, and I thoroughly enjoyed the characterizations as Horton, Gertrude McFuzz, the Whos and so many other characters come to life before our ears. I loved the mix of musical styles and the clear storytelling that was going on within the lyrics.SEUSSICAL may not be a show for critics or for those whose taste in musical theatre has been ruined by the overproduced messes of Andrew Lloyd Webber, but this is marvelous fun, and I plan to use it in class. Even if it doesn't take any Tony Awards and people like Rosie O'Donnell can't keep it alive on Broadway, out here in the midwest, it will be a hit, and theatres, especially those like the Children's Theatre Company in Minneapolis can look forward to enchanting audiences with this material for years to come.SEUSSICAL is terrific! Take it from an elementary teacher who knows and loves the work of Dr. Seuss.
Anyone interested in conservative politics has probably heard of David Horowitz, inexhaustible political author, columnist extraordinaire, ... among other things. A couple of his more notorious books are "Hating Whitey" and "Radical Son".Horowitz writes in a consistently aggressive style and he always stays true to his Conservative Libertarian ideals. One particularly interesting book of his is "The Art of Political War And Other Radical Pursuits". This title was released in the year 2000, prior to the infamous Presidential election fiasco.This book is split into two main sections, as its title is divided. And also, as the title suggests, the first part of the book seems to be patterned after the classic, "Sun Tzu, The Art of War".In the first section of the book, Horowitz clearly defines the players, the rules, and the tactics of this "political war". The liberals are predictably playing outside of the traditional rules, while the conservatives stand aside and complain about the fouls. There are no shortages of specific examples to illustrate these truths, and Horowitz is not afraid to draw conclusions.He calls for fighting fire with fire. I'm just not so sure that the politics of personal destruction works all that well. I'd rather see the conservatives stick to their principles and avoid playing the game altogether. Either way, the first section of the book stands tall as a beacon of conservative understanding in modern politics.The second half of the book is even more interesting as Horowitz covers a variety of controversial topics. One of his most popular topics is "Hating Whitey", his book and the title of a thought-provoking chapter in this book. He clearly holds true to his overall outspoken position against racism of any form. Considering that he is a former Black Panther, I find him to be credible when he speaks about white racism. Yet, even considering his hardcore civil rights career, which continues to this day, he is labeled a "racist" by demagogues from the left at every prospect. And he continues on, fighting the oppression from these very leftists with which he used to associate.His strongest point in this chapter lies in the negative results of the 'help' of the mainstream Black civil rights leaders. Horowitz concludes, "The continued suffering of disadvantaged black communities and the continued under-par performance of black school children is a price the well-heeled civil rights establishment is apparently willing to pay for guilt tributes from all-too-accommodating white 'oppressors'." Jesse Jackson is truly an extortionist, and Horowitz lets him have it.One particularly poignant chapter is entitled, "Guns Don't Kill Blacks, Other Black People Do". Horowitz fills the chapter with scary statistics that point toward a dire situation in the US where people need to promote and accept personal responsibility for social ills, rather than laying the blame on other people and inanimate objects. He makes sense.Another standout chapter, "The Intellectual Class War", covers the peculiar fact that many of the most outspoken anti-capitalists are the most successful capitalists in the country. The very people who benefit the most from our liberties are those who tirelessly try to destroy it. Again, Horowitz bombards his reader with hard evidence that is undeniable.Perhaps the most satisfying part of the book is his detailed analysis of three prominent Leftist elitists who concocted their own biographical information to suit their agenda. Let me just say that the conclusion is priceless.David Horowitz speaks to the average citizen when he writes. He is a former hardcore Leftist, and shouts with authority and believability on these matters. He also takes the opportunity to attempt to set his record straight, being that his is a regular target in the politics of personal destruction.This is a book that should be on every conservative's shelf. It is straightforward and honest, as well as enlightening. Sometimes a shock to the system is needed to make forward progress. This could be it. I highly recommend this book.
I love all 3 films and Baz Lurhman for making them.The 1st film Strictly Ballroom is about a wallflower in love with an energetic young male dancer from a ballroom dancing obsessed family. Scott Hastings is set to become ballroom dancing's next star, but his partner Liz, leaves him for a hilariously drunk idiot puppet dancer. Enter Fran, the wallflower student in his mother's studio and the daughter of immigrants. The immigrants are fabulous Latin dancers seeing as Fran's father is a legendary flamenco dancer, her Grandmother is too and the Paso Doble is never the same when you see it in this movie. The lesson of the movie is never let fear keep you from your dreams even against tremendous odds. The subject of the movie is also dance and you see it at its visual best with cinematic glitzThe 2nd film is a modern homage to Shakespeare with the tale of Romeo and Juliet portrayed in a modern setting, but with the immortal words of Shakespeare. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Daines are the perfect actors to play the doomed lovers; I also loved John Leguizamo as the smart Mercutio. The visual power of the film combined with the words is indeed appealing to the current generation's preference for visual media.The 3rd film combines dance, words, and music to culminate in a cinematic masterpiece to the senses that seduces the viewer into the story. The doomed romance of Christian and Satine is made more poignant by the sharp use of color and the witty use of modern musical pop tunes. I will never forget the rendition of Like A Virgin.I recommend everyone to have these 3 films in their movie collection.
I SAW THIS MOVIE WHEN I WAS 17.... OVER 20 YEARS AGO "I LOVED IT!", Would like to buy it on DVD...or i'll settle for VHS? the acting was great Hurt and Raul were terrific
Gaelen Foley has a gift for turning out tortured and vulnerable heroes. She does it again here, as the story revolves around a man who is destined for royalty but has to first battle the inner demons that make him feel unworthy of his destiny.Lazar di Fiori is the prince of the island kingdom of Ascension, but as a child he watched his family be murdered by those who intended to take over the throne. While he escaped death, he had to suffer years as a slave before becoming a pirate. His experiences have left him feeling suicidal, as he feels his experiences have turned him into a coward who was victimized by his master. The one thing keeping him alive is vengence against the people who murdered his family.Allegra Monteverdi is the daughter of the mayor of Ascension...the same guy who ordered Lazar's family to be murdered. Allegra isn't emotionally close to her father. She is loyal to the people of Ascension who are suffering at the hands of her father's reign. Her family used to be close to the royal family and therefore, she knew Lazar as a child and even now fantasizes about Lazar returning to take over his kingdom and restore the faith and fortune of his people.Lazar's plan for revenge includes kidnapping Allegra, staging an uprising where he'll capture her family, including her father, then execute all of them at dawn. However, the night before the deed is to be done, Lazar ends up having to rescue Allegra from her fiance' who is attempting to rape her. The attraction is instant and electric and Lazar finds he cannot kill Allegra. He instead decides to kidnap her back to his ship. Allegra doesn't know Lazar is the prince she's been waiting for until much later, so there is some sexual tension while she pines for the prince (in other words, Lazar is in competition with himself!)The story from there centers on Lazar's inner turmoil. The events of his childhood have left him feeling as though his soul is too evil to save and that his life is going to end without salvation. Upon seeing Allegra again, he realizes he might have found his salvation, if only he could get past the feelings of guilt and shame he's feeling. What makes him such a wonderful hero is the fact that while his experiences have made him a hardened pirate, they have not made him invincible. he still suffers from images of what he had to go through during his enslavement and it's truly heartwrenching to read.Allegra is a wonderful heroine in that she's compassionate, strong, courageous, and feminine. Her love for the people of Ascension makes her determined to help Lazar accept his place as their king. She doesn't back down when they find themselves in danger and in willing to jump into danger to save Lazar if she has to.In this story, the reader sees how love can redeem even the most blackened of souls. The relationship between Allegra and Lazar is powerful as Allegra's love gives Lazar the strength to take back his kingdom. There was action, but not a whole lot, with the focus being on the developing relationship bewteen Allegra and Lazar.The love scenes were luscious and varied. Foley is generally very descriptive with her scenes, but not so much that you think it's porn. She does a great job of making the connection between the emotional and physical aspects of being sexually intimate.The only thing that prevents this story from receiving five stars is the fact Lazar goes on a bit long with the self-loathing thing. I wish he had realized his worth a little sooner so Allegra wouldn't have had to suffer as much as she did while he tried to figure out what he wanted to do. there's a bit about a curse that was just plain ridiculous to me, seeming as little more than an unnecessary plot device.Other than that, you'll love this book if you like reading about the redemptive power of love and how it can give a man strength enough to overcome his fears and feelings of unworthiness.
We got this to replace a broken HD antenna. And WOW, what a difference! We hadn't even realized that HD reception could be this good. Our previous antenna was ALWAYS losing the picture and sound, no matter how many fine adjustments we made to it. This one, however, we just plugged in and stuck behind the TV, and that was the end of it. I always try out new antennas behind the TV, out of sight, first -- because that is where I want them to be -- out of sight and doing their job silently. This one, does just that. It picks up ALL of the major network stations in perfect HD picture and sound. It doesn't drop the picture or sound if you get near it. It doesn't drop the picture or sound if it is cloudy/raining outside. It just stays on, and doesn't require any fiddling on my part. Which is exactly what I wanted. Maybe we are very close to broadcast towers, I don't know, but I do know that our previous antenna didn't work 1/3 as well as this one does. It is rock solid.On a side (and rather irrelevant) note, the thing IS large. It stands about 2.5 feet tall, and the antenna wire/blade piece is HUGE. It is easily double the size of our last antenna -- and that obviously makes a difference in the reception quality. So, that is an easy compromise for me to make. But, if size and appearance matter to you, you may want to keep that in mind. Look at the images of the antenna and the customer pictures that have already been posted. They are accurate.Overall, the size and appearance of the antenna don't matter to me nearly as much as the quality of the picture and sound quality and I repeat, they are rock solid. I wholeheartedly recommend this antenna.
Compared to other reviews, I thought this book was wonderful. I thoroughly enjoyed it for my first Elizabeth Boyle novel. The story is about plain and ordinary Miss Charlotte Wilmont who makes a wish with a magic ring. She wishes to be the woman Sebastian Marlowe, Viscount Trent, loves. When she wakes up the next morning in his bed, her wish comes true but not quite the way she hoped. Charlotte is his mistress! The story has a magical/fairytale theme to it. It's alittle Cinderella + The Lord of the Rings since the story started with a magic ring that everybody wants. Also, Charlotte has an evil mother that tries to ruin her plans to be with Sebastian. I also liked the frequent steamy love scenes. For my first Elizabeth Boyle book, His Mistress by Morning was delightful. Definetly work a well deserved 4 stars in my opinion.
Unfortunately the Tanzquartett Wien chose to pursue the "interpretive" route in performance. The result is a sloppy, easy-listening style which exemplifies the Italian peculiarity of Tempo rubato (stolen time).For elevator or cafe music, I suppose one could do worse. For actual ballroom music in true Vienna period style, to which one could actually dance waltzes, forget it.Try instead the excellent performances by the late Willi Boskovsky and his ensemble. Sadly, many of these are not in current issue. The used/collector's aftermarket within this retailer are a good source from which I have obtained CDs of many of Boskovsky's works.
I actually did look forward to the release of this film due to the premise of the plot and being a sucker for a good romantic comedy. An added bonus was that Scott Winant of "thirtysomething" fame (my all-time favorite television show) was the director/producer. Simple plot- two people meet briefly throughout their lives on parallel courses until their lives become involved with the future of an old apartment building slated for demolition. The Fates enlighten them with the realization that they are soulmates destined to meet and fall in love. Well, I was a sucker- for going to see this movie! I can't think of another movie that got yanked out of my local cinema faster than this one was (less than a week). I can't think of another movie in recent memory that I checked my watch as many times as I did during this flick. It was more exciting to look at my watch dial than the movie screen.While the story did have brief flashes of brillance in some of the dialog pertaining to life philosophies, they were few and far between. Dylan McDermott, always a good actor, absolutely flubs here. Sarah Jessica Parker, never one of my favorite actresses, looks so bad in this film to me that I was afraid my eyes were going to bleed... I guess I couldn't look away every time she was on the screen for that reason. Jean Tripplehorn's attempts at physical comedy left me gasping. Everytime she was hit with something or knocked down or fell, I wanted to jump into the movie and yell at the director (or call PETA) for torturing this poor woman that way. At least Jennifer Aniston and Ken Olin had the good sense to save their careers by appearing only briefly in minor supporting roles.The self-angsting dialogue on "thirtysomething" worked incredibly well and bonded you to the characters. In this movie, listening to the characters bemoan their life circumstances you finally say, "Enough is enough!" and hope they all get hit by a bus so they stop talking. The plot flows along very disjointedly and at a very slow pace. I felt no chemistry between the two main characters, who are destined to meet and fall in love. The finale takes a sudden awkward jump a few years later when the couple are married and putting their child to bed. How the plot/premise went from "A" to "B" (how this couple fell in love and decided to make a life commitment) was left unanswered by the film and made the ending very unsatisifying, disappointing, and unbelievable.Whoever the hair stylist was for this film should never work again. &lt;heh heh> Mr. McDermott has a great head of hair. His greased look in this film- not a "successful architect style", that's for sure- terrible and very distracting! Ms. Parker's hair style?? My nightmares as a 5 year old were not as scary as this disaster on her head!In all fairness, I will say some one good thing about this film. The cinematography is wonderful, especially around the apartment complex. You always see this dust, fuzz, or pussy willow type stuff floating in the air in the building's courtyard. I'm still trying to figure out the symbolism intended by the director of this effect. There are quite a few recognizable name actors in this film, but remember "Mars Attacks"? The film is such a flub, it is one of those movies you will want to watch more than once because the acting and dialogue are so bad.... like a horrible car wreck with blood, gore, and screams of agony- you can't take your eyes away! (heh heh) I always put this movie on when I'm in a masochistic mood and feel the need to be punished by Hollywood.
Bought these as a gift, everyone said they liked them and the quality was great for the price. What more could you want?
Amazon has had the most experience with e-book readers and it shows with this product.Due to how many file types can be read by the kindle II I find it most useful to simply download or convert those files to either pdf or txt. I like the fact that you can pick up where you left off even when switching between books and documents. The online book selection still leaves a bit to be desired, but that is slowly improving even on a daily basis. Most of this is the publishing companies and some is the authors but with papers, magazines and book sales dipping that will change.
It is interesting to read what other people have said about this DVD. I agree with some of the comments from reviewers who have given it fewer stars but I gave it five stars because I use it a lot and because I think it deserves a five star rating for being a highest quality presentation and very useful. I do not recommend it for rank beginners. Anyone interested in yoga should try to take a class or workshop from a certified instructor and not just rely on videos. If you do teach yourself from videos though, get several. Living Arts (now known as Gaiam) has some good ones. This DVD is a good supplement to a do-at-home yoga regime.You can use this video for short or long programs. It's easy to select a program. Some of them target specific areas of the body (for example neck, arms and abs, spine, feet, hands, legs and hips). There are a lot of different postures covered in the video, some I've never seen anywhere such as hand or eye or feet exercises and, one of my favorites, the seven easy pieces. This DVD has headstands on it which none of my other ones do. There are lots of seated, stretching postures and standing postures. Sun salute, moon salute, and heroes sequence are covered, but only gone through once on each side. You can repeat them if you're quick with the remote, though, and don't mind hearing all of the same instructions over again.There are a couple of meditation segments that she talks you through. These are kind of nice if you don't mind being talked to during meditation. Also there are special exercise sequences for "that time of the month" which is a pleasant feature.There aren't many instructions about breathing. If you are a beginner you probably won't miss them. I may get shouted out of the yoga community for seeming to suggest that correct breathing isn't an essential part of yoga; shout away. People will breathe anyway. Anyone familiar with yoga will know how to breathe. So, this video doesn't cover breathing well.Be warned. Some of the reviewers have said that you could hurt your back. They are telling the truth, but you can hurt your back from every single yoga video out there if you try to copy the demonstrator. The instructor on this video tells you with her voice how far to go. Maybe she could scream and shout to make it a little clearer, but we do have brains of own . . .You don't have to watch the disclaimer that shows up after you've selected your workout. Just press the "next" button on your remote. Practice using your remote with this DVD because you will find that you can skip a posture and repeat a posture, but once it has passed to the next one you can't go back to it.Main weaknesses as far as I'm concerned: relaxation poses at the end are too short and she talks through them. I don't like that, but when she's done there's a music loop that's fairly long (for a loop) you can use to relax in peace a little longer. I wish there was a printed copy of what's in each program because it isn't always easy to remember where some of my favorites are. You'll have the DVD a long time, though, so you will eventually become familiar with the names of your favorite programs.
I really enjoyed this book but have to say I disliked the rushed ending. You never find out how the heroine makes her way back to England or know what the hero goes through to try and find her. It just happens. Despite that I have to say that I am willing to read it again. Not her best but DEFINITELY not her worst.
I just got done reading the King of the world by David Remnick and he did a wonderful job portraying that first part of Muhammads life. But This book, Through the eyes of the world, did so much more for me to understand the life of Muhammad Ali. It is absolutly astonding how people pictured him and how they admire him now. There is no specific writer, it's all comwntaries from different people, actors, writers, poets, photographers, trainers, etc. This book shows whaty kind of a man he truly was, not the man that the public wants you to think he was. He was a man that stood up for himself better than anyone. He got Boxing out of control of the mob and defied how the white man wanted black boxers to act. Some comentaries in this book are short and some are long, but all give very good and detailed explainations and descriptions of how they viewd Muhammad Ali. I give this book a definate 5 stars. I would give it 6 stars if I could. What the heck, I'd give it 100 stars. In fact I do, I give this book 100 stars.
I had a Littman which I loved and lost, and needed a replacement - pronto - as I am in nursing school. I ordered the Prestige for price, length, and weight. There are many inexpensive scopes with a double tube towards the diaphragm and this adds to the weight. I have also tried some with poorly fitting ear pieces, which more or less renders them useless. This has a very sensitive diaphragm, well-fitting ear pieces (and two sets of replacements)... it is a nice color, excellent length, good weight, reasonable price, and arrived quickly.
Better yet, how about releasing a Loretta Young box set with this movie, Ramona (Fox's first Technicolor movie), Kentucky, Suez, The Story of Alexander Graham Bell (should have been out on DVD years ago) and Mother is a Freshman to name just a few????? GIVE US A BREAK, FOX!
this book is exceptional.very complete in the theory and functioning of automatic transmissionsvery well written, well structured and organized. covers the hydraulics of the torque converter and every element of a transmission and transaxle.
There is only one negative thing you can say about this book - as long as it is it still has to end sometime! Rowling does not dissapoint - it was worth the wait. I'm already looking forward to reading it again - the plot is so compelling that I couldn't read it quickly enough the first pass, so now I intend to read it again and savor all of the little details. Be prepared to spend some time with your heart in your throat - Rowling's hint that someone important dies is no lie - but so many of your favorite characters are in mortal peril at one time or another that you'll be worried about one or more of them at many points during the story.
If you listen to Pink Floyd for Roger Waters' cynical lyrical commentary, then this album is for you. It features some of his highest poetry showcasing the futility of war and frustrations of society's more disgruntled members. However if you are more interested in playing air guitar to Have a Cigar, than you likely find this album to be a complete drag. Musically, it's rather bland and pasted together with none of the intricate radiance heard best on Wish You Were Here, probably due to the details of Waters' expulsion Wright and intolerance of influence from Gilmour or Mason on this work. I also agree that this was the first Waters solo album in everything but name. This album is not, in my opinion, Pink Floyd but a side factor of the band's existance and thus not as good.
I just love, love love this pink!!! It's the perfect pink shade, a nice warm, medium pink. The finish is very unique. It think they call it a "jelly" finish. The color sort of builds up the more layers you add and yet it has a sort of translucency while still being opaque. It paints on beautifully smooth - no streaks! - and dries swiftly. I love the style of bottle that Orly uses as well. The straight sides make it very easy to get the polish out of the bottle, even when the level of polish is low in the bottle. Also their polishes last a while without getting thickened or sticky. Their brushes are the best of any brand of nail polish too, just the right length and width to get a perfect manicure. Orly is my favorite brand of polish :D
I thought this was an entertaining book until I heard the author on the Al Franken Show today and he couldn't answer for any of the mistakes/lies that he has in the book. So now I am having a tough time believing most of the garbage in this book. Before anyone else buys this book, they should read the transcript from the Al Franken Show. You can view it here.http://www.geocities.com/david2503/FrankenShow.htm
Not being a football fan I watched the movie Invincible only at the persistant urging of a friend. I came away with a real appreciation of both the movie and the true story upon which it is based. As I was watching I couldn't help but notice that the music chosen to set the mood of the time was absolutely perfect. The producers chose these songs carefully, avoiding the trap of simply looking at a Top 40 list for the exact period the movie represents. Instead the songs represent good songs from the era that we may not have heard lately. The effect is dramatic; listening to this soundtrack I'm transported back to 1976 (and feel as if I'm listening to the radio in my old Chevy Malibu).If you haven't seen the movie let me please recommendInvincible, the true-life story of a 30 year old man that became a NFL player. If you want an inexpensive form of time travel to take you back to the mid '70s you could do no better than this CD.
One of the new Hollywood trends has been adapting videogames into movies. This is not necessarily anything new, but has gotten more popular with the success of the Tomb Raider and Resident Evil films. I play video games and love the thin backstories for the interactive videogame experience. However, most of these movies should never have seen the light of day.I knew it would be trouble when the movie opens with the longest narrated text thread I have ever witnessed. Whatever happened to the protagonist explaining the setup as part of the movie? The story opens with a decent action sequence, but the movie makes little sense.The strange secret government task force looks ridiculous and are as ever ineffectual. They need to rely on the rogue former agent (Christian Slater) to save the day. Slater really sleepwalks through this film but who could blame him. None of the other acting is better. Tara Reid stumbles with her dialogue and Stephen Dorff could not have been more ridiculous as the leader of Section 713.The movie ends mysteriously and open ended. Hopefully no sequel is in the making. One thing that occurred to me in reflecting on "Alone in the Dark" was how much it seemed like the movie was made as cutscenes for the videogame. The command center particularly evoked this suspicion.I titled this review "worst Videogame movie ever" and I believe it. I've seen some bad ones too. The "street Fighter" film comes to mind as well as the misguided "super Mario Brothers". This one takes the prize.
I have almost no experience with writing makefiles. All I've done is edit existing makefiles until they work without really knowing what I am doing. I bought this book to fill in my knowledge. There seems to be a lot of information in this book. Unfortunately, there is a lot of information not in the book that makes it difficult to follow his examples. For example, on p. 5 there is text in there that makes up the file 'lexer.l', but the author doesn't say this. He simply puts that text on the page, calls it a 'scanner', then I see something called 'lexer.l' in the makefile he is using. It took me a while to figure out that the 10 or so lines of text he called a 'scanner' was in fact 'lexer.l'.The author continually does this for at least the first 20 pages, where it took me hours to figure out what files he used and what were supposed to be in the files. This should have only taken me as long as it takes to type the files into the computer. There are supposed to be five files: counter.h lexer.h count_words.c counter.c and lexer.l. I don't understand why the auther cannot simply say "the text below define *.*", then write it out, instead of making the reader guess at what he is talking about. On page 20 he talks about refactoring the 'main' program, but what he really means is creating a new file called 'counter.c' not rewriting the 'main' program in 'count_words.c'.It's too bad the author has decided to write in such an ambiguous style because his explainations of make features are very good, unfortunately, I can't verify this using his examples because he thinks his readers can read his mind.The frustration caused by this lack of explicitness for his examples is the reason I give this book one star. Instead of simply using his examples, I have to figure out what the heck he is talking about, then try to use them the way he is. I'm spending orders of magnitudes more on this guessing than I am on learning make, which is why this book sucks. I'm only on page 20 and all ready I don't really want to use this book. I guess if you all ready know how to use make and just want a reference, this book is probably fine as you have plenty of your own examples to follow. But I do not.
The rumor about this album is that the Stooges blew their advance money for this album on drugs, and in an impaired state, accidently mixed everything except the vocals down to one track during the mixing process, then called Bowie in to try and salvage it. I tend to believe that story because that's what RP sounds like. I did an A/B comparison with this VS the original. and like this one better.
Sophia Coppola's film Somewhere grabbed my attention from the start. But it took several more viewings before I felt that I really understood the director's intentions. It all became clear to me near the end when "Johnny Marco" and his daughter "Cleo" are alone in the lobby of the Chateau Marmont. Johnny sits down at the piano and bravely struggles throug the aria of J.S. Bach's Golderg Variations. Music lovers know that the aria is a very simple piece, followed by 29 variations much more diffeicult to execute, including some that challenge the abilities of the greatest keyboard artists who ever lived. As such, the Bach piece serves as a beautiful methaphor for parenthood. It's easy in the beginning. Almost anyone can become a parent. The tricky stuff comes later. Good for Johnny that he made it through the aria, but what's going to happen when he encounters the first four part fugue? I truely loved this movie. Give it a chance.You will be rewarded. Elle Fanning was terrific in portraying a girl balanced precariously on a a line between childhood and adolescence. She is a very, very talented actress.
Very fresh, very good, and quite energetic. What kind of vitamins does Mick take anyway?Seriously, you'll be happy with this album. I strongly recommend it.
There are 2 problems with this disc. First, the commentary by Jennifer Saunders that was promised is missing, and second, "Gay" is presented in cropped format instead of the original widescreen as broadcast in the UK. This is stupid, as Season 4 was correctly released in widescreen, so why isn't this follow-up? If you want to see the entire picture, import the Uk disc which also includes the commentary. "The Last Shout" is fine as it was filmed before widescreen TV took over in the UK. Avoid the US DVD and get the UK one if you have a region free player.
I suppose that it is useless for me to criticize this book. Thinking people will shy away from it without my having warned them, while credulous people, especially those with relatively little training in actual Christian doctrine other than having heard a lot of Bible-thumping sermons, will be impressed.Several reviews state that this is an extremely amusing book. I confess, I didn't so much as crack a smile. I found the writing free of grammatical errors, but otherwise no better than what I'd expect of your average college freshman. I thought the allusions in the early chapters to the Maltese Falcon were cheap and pointless.The characterizations were shallow. The main character, Max Busby, serves through most of the story as a surrogate for Satan, gradually goading Darwin into accepting a world view that denies God. And why does Max do this? He does it because he's really really really bad, because his father beat him, and he transferred his hatred of his father into hatred of God. The author makes the explicit claim that this is true of all atheists.Many reviewers have written that this book made them re-think evolutionary theory. I am mystified. Other than implying that evolutionary theory is inspired by the devil, I didn't notice that the book made any cogent argument at all: it mischaracterized Darwinism at every turn and then attacked only the parody rather than the reality of evolutionary theory.Please avoid this book. It is a complete waste of time.
Our family has allergies to wheat, soy, and cassein. Makes snacks on the go a challenge. This is a great non-carbohydrate snack and tastes good, too. No added soy protein or wheat gluten or dairy like some have - just meat and what it takes to flavor and preserve it.
I had to read this book in school. I was taking human biology on my way to being a lactation consultant.At the time I read only what I needed to read in order to compile the info I needed for my papers, tests and exams. I have just read it again cover to cover, and my thoughts of it have not changed it.I didn't learn anything I didn't already know about my body.For the young lady or woman who wants to learn about her own body, and find an effective form of birth control, then this is the book for you!However, it has not helped us to become pregnant. Though it's through no fault of the author. It's just my body that doesn't work the 'right' way.
C.J. Carmichael's Intrigue debut, &quot;Same Place, Same Time,&quot; is an expert blend of romance and mystery, new and old, danger and passion. Therapist Trista Emerson doesn't know which is worse. One of her patients has turned up dead, and her ex-husband, Detective Morgan Forester, is back in her life. Pain and misunderstandings broke them apart. Now Trista needs him. Morgan insists she is in danger, and it isn't long before Trista knows he is right. She can trust him to keep her safe. Can she trust herself enough to let him back into her heart?Carmichael's tale is one readers will not want to miss. The murderer's identity is sure to keep readers guessing, and Carmichael ultimately offers a fresh take on a classic premise. The mystery has a similar feel to the older, much missed stories Intrigue used to tell. At the same time, Trista and Morgan's relationship is complex and moving in the way some of the more recent titles have become. Many authors spell out everything about their characters right away. Carmichael has a way of slowly revealing information about the characters' back story that feels strange early on. In the end, it pays off big time. We are slowly discovering who these people are as they rediscover each other, so we are experiencing what they are in a way few books achieve. Throw in an original title, an excellent use of setting in the city of Toronto, and a nail-biter finale, and &quot;Same Place, Same Time&quot; is a New Year's treat.
The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that I found it a bit long in parts. Wannabe President Kerry Kilcannon is a great character study of someone who is unsure just how much to lose or compromise to ascend to the highest office. What's nice is that he is an honest to goodness good person. I wish he were running for office in real life. I recommend this book. This was the first Patterson book I have read, but it won't be the last.
I read this book years ago and still pick up my tatterd old copy and re-read this great book. Mr. Goldberg gives a realistic appraisal of the dynanamics of male/female relationships. This book really explains in depth the underlying causes of breakups and the suffering that follows. Also there is an excellent chapter on what type of relationships to avoid and learning the history of potential partners to predict the future of the relationship. This is not a woman bashing book in any sense and women would be well served to read this great book..It really gives the nuts and bolts of what happens in relationships and how/why they go wrong. Considering the almost 60% divorice rate...its well worth the time to read.
Lisa Loeb's debut is one of my favorite records of all time. Behind this pair of glasses hides a true songwriting and singing talent. On her later cd's, Loeb is better vocally, but on Tails, there is a more pleasant atmosphere. There is no single filler track on this album, as each is instantly catchy.(1) IT'S OVER - "Sorry sir I stole your money" - It was a bit of a grower, but it has become my favorite. A timid tension takes it to a higher level. 10/10(2) SNOW DAY - Another favorite. Hopeful lyrics, and very catchy. 10/10(3) TAFFY - Lisa rocks out, on, again, a favorite. I really like the bridge in this song. 10/10(4) WHEN ALL THE STARTS WERE FALLING - Again a very strong song, with the fantastic "And I fell down, down" part. Lyrics such as "I've learned how to dance from a Vincent van Gogh" make listening this one very enjoyable. 8/10(5) DO YOU SLEEP? - The music gets gloomier. Again a very catchy song, in spite of its darkness. 9/10(6) HURRICANE - Probably the darkest song on the album, with -maybe- the best lyrics. The instrumental ending leaves you longing for more. 9/10(7) ROSE-COLORED TIMES - Another favorite, apparently happy, but crafted with melancholy. 10/10(8) SANDALWOOD - A very sweet song with a very sweet name. From the beginning to the brilliant ending "I wanted to show you." 8/10(9) ALONE - An upbeat song with a quirky melody. I think this is the least good song on Tails, but others idolize it, so decide for your own. 7/10(10) WAITING FOR WEDNESDAY - A very happy song, with a not so happy subject (a pregnant woman). Another favorite, although the song gets a little dull towards the end. 10/10(11) LISA LISTEN - This slow song with an antimetrical chorus brings in variation. 8/10(12) GARDEN OF DELIGHTS - This short song is very cool. Try to hear Lisa counting down. 9/10(13) STAY - This is Lisa's most famous song and is indeed very beautiful. 10/10I think you should buy Tails even if you have just a little interest in this wonderful artist.
After the perfectly plotted, seamlessly edited Fellowship, the scattered, unfaithful, and frequently confusing Two Towers is not merely an artistic disappointment, but also cause for a falling out with Peter Jackson's vision. We see much, but in several small parts--the DVD lists more than 50 scenes--not all of which cohere or have sufficient time to explore the developments of the characters or the depths of Tolkien's theme; the writers and director seem to have tried to compensate by inserting several brief melodramatic bits of dialogue that are so anomalous that they come out almost farcically. Perhaps the film is best symbolized by Sean Astin; not only have his acting and pseudo-British accent degraded since the first film, but he is given several calculatingly sappy lines that, at the conclusion of a long and difficult-to-appreciate story, are downright outrageous. While Elijah Wood shines for his increasingly confident and even mature acting, he cannot make up for poor writing, directing, and editing. This is literary adaptation at its very worst. But what is perhaps even more disturbing than the adaptation are the reviews here at amazon.com; why is ignorance about books and authors--and anti-Tolkienism in particular--being touted by customers at a website that earned its fame by selling books? Have we become so foolish? I recommend www.tolkiensociety.org for reviews that tend to be written by people who remember that the author of The Two Towers was Tolkien, not Jackson. I look forward to the "Return" hesitantly, with little faith; I hope that the final film reawakens the enjoyment that I experienced when viewing "Fellowship."
I have a similar model, pretty much exactly the same but without the tray. If I had known this existed, I would have bought that one instead. The model I own is the only one the local corporate supplier had. What a great bag! I'm an Apprentice Electrician, and this fits everything I need except a pole. Nice smaller pockets for my Flash Drive to hold digital versions of books, study guides, and my Apprentice Hour logs, without fear of being damaged. You can easily reach anything in this bag, except for large items like a composition book (for notes) in the center, because the handle is in the way. I wish you could remove the handle, as I always use the bag with a rolling cart or the shoulder strap instead.
This book lays down the inspired frame work for the long term running of The First Church of Christ, Scientist. This book is incredibly important to read, if you are a Christian Scientist, you already own a copy and fully understand what I am saying. If you are not a Christian Scientist, then you should pick up this book to learn more about the actual running of our Church. Of course this book is no replacement for Science and Health With Key to the Scriptures by Mary Baker Eddy.
I have read reviews saying that people are disappointed because there was no gore, or disappointed because the transfer wasn't to their standards.... GET OVER IT. Twilight Zone the movie is very underrated in my opinion. This movie pays great homage to the TV show produced by Rod Sterling. This film is a fantasy, sci-fi, horror, and I tend to believe that it is done in such a format that most ages can watch it. For a movie to be good it doesn't have to have gore. If a film can make you think differently about a situation then the writer director has accomplished a great job. The first story about the racist having to suffer the lives of those who he discriminated make you think outside the box about racism. The second is a light hearted tale where the elderly have a second chance at being young again, this segment is suitable for all ages. The third installment is just weird but exciting as cartoon elements are weaved into reality by a adolescent. The final tale, although it doesn't show a drop of blood is scary as hell. I recall watching this when I was a kid and I blame that darned gremlin ripping the plane apart to be my reason for hating to travel by aviation. Even to this day the gremlin and plane creep me out. I suggest, buy this, but do note there is not one drop of blood in this film, and although I am a gore hound, this collection is still worth the buy.
Not what I'd consider a magazine. It's just a bunch of advertisements, and listings of over priced trendy "in" items, with maybe two articles. I usually don't read the article of the cover celebrity in any magazine, so all in all this magazine is an absolute bore. I flipped right through it and found no interest, and it went right in the recycling bin. I was gifted a subscription so I guess I'll either be donating or recycling them all. If you're not a hard core shopper who needs to be told what to wear and where to buy it, don't bother.
I just got Syd Barrett's solo album "The Madcap Laughs," after ordering it quite a while ago-- before his death. I've found myself almost unable to listen to anything else. For a few days all I've been listening to is The Madcap Laughs. This album is priceless. The thing about it that makes it different is Syd's worldview, something sort of hesitating between childhood and adulthood in a beautiful way.Now a song-by-song analysis:-"Terrapin" is a wonderful opening, just a really sweet song. When you hear it you think it's the best song ever... yet the album even manages to eclipse that.-"No Good Trying" took me a few listens, but after that it quickly became one of my top songs. The strange rhythms, the incredible juxtapositions of the lyrics, the subject matter-- it's like nothing ever heard before.-"Love You" is cute, a little bit strange but poppy and rather enjoyable.-"No Man's Land" I really like. It's the most normal song of the bunch, and the one that most resembles Syd's -looks-, I think. Very rock-y but quite easy to get into.-"Dark Globe" is a plea for help, and although the song itself isn't delivered in an incredible way, just the words are heartbreaking.-"Here I Go" is blues that actually sounds different from most blues! It's a good song, fun to sing along with.-"Octopus" used to be my favorite song, but it's eclipsed now by a couple others on this album. Still, it's an amazing song, with patterns and a tune that you can really sink your teeth into.-"Golden Hair" I actually like the least; it's a little creepy. If you like "Chapter 24" from Piper, it's pretty similar. Lyrics by James Joyce.-"Long Gone" is unremarkable but rather nice. Two words, by the way, that Syd uses a lot in this album are "hand" and "understand."-"She Took a Long Cold Look" is, I think, actually really beautiful. The lyrics and tune are quite lovely, and I sort of like how you can hear Syd turn the page. Then there's a bit of talking, which is a little sad and also interesting. The talking is more of a window into his mind, the way he communicated, which is cool.-"Feel" is a decent song with a nice hook.-"If It's in You" isn't great, and you can tell that Syd is just sort of plugging through it, trying to get it over with. Nevertheless, it's not a bad song. I doubt the guy could write a bad song if he tried.-"Late Night," finally, is a perfect ending. This song is so beautiful. It rivals "Here Comes the Sun" in tenderness and touchingness and, well, just beauty. This song alone is worth the album price.At first I had this rated four stars, but I just changed it to five. Because it is quite a good album. Can you tell Syd is losing it? Yes, you can, but not by the material. The songs are great, and he clearly was an artistic genius. Again, I've never heard anything that sounds like this. The closest I can get is Pink Floyd (some songs in The Wall sound a bit like a few of these), and maybe Lou Reed a little bit, with the solos. But neither of those are really like Syd's childlike, unique songs at all. I would play many of these for my kids, if I had them. Yet they hold my own attention completely.Syd was a true artist, and his descent into madness and seclusion (and recently, his death) is a real tragedy. Rest in peace, Syd.
To begin with, I think this film is a true cineastic masterpiece. From its hauntingly beautiful score through the breathtaking landscape shots to the meticulous detail observed with any buildings, item of clothing and other equipment down to the last little piece of Native jewellery used, this film let's you immerse yourself into a powerful image of 17th century eastern Canada "as it really was". The film is at its best when it illustrates mutual misunderstandings in the encounter of two completely different cultures.The clash of cultures is often illustrated by sharp cuts between Native and European worlds. These are always interesting, sometimes quite amusing. Often they amount to sheer propaganda of "savagery" vs. "civilisation". Indians huddle together, fart and copulate in dark, dirty and stinking wigwams while Europeans walk across beautiful Old World city squares conspiciously devoid of beggars, cripples and the omipresent garbage and sewage of the time. Indians practice primitive shamanism in forests while Europeans stride through light-flooded cathedrals and vow to relinquish the amenities of western Civilisation to salvage the infidels (even if "they" already cut off one of your ears in the process). Europeans do well-mannered house music in aristocratic mansions. Indians do it like dogs in the dirt. Always, anywhere and with anyone, as the film will teach us through relentless repetition.The clash of belief systems is personalised in an encounter of the dignified Jesuit priest with an Indian shaman - impersonalised by a ridiculously behaving and profoundly vicious yellow painted dwarf. What could have been an interesting example of Indian attitudes towards disabled and retarded people - worshipping people who are different as a manifestation of the divine instead of confining them to the margins of society - is turned into just another example of the film's leitmotif - the savagery of the barbaric Indian.When the film was released a New York Times critic lauded the fact that this historical film got by with portraying American colonial history"without villains". Without white villains that is, of course. Set in a time when every City Hall inquisition room in the Christian west was equipped with arsenals of torture tools beyond the imagination of any Indian, when the Thirty Years War was raging through central Europe where entire populations of large cities were butchered to the last woman and infant while seeking refuge in churches and when one third of Germany's population was slaughtered by armies of fellow Christians, the film centers entirely on what it presents as a realistic portray of "Indian savagery". When the Algonquin party with its European guests is captured by Iroquoians (the Algonquians speak neither Algonquian nor do the Iroquois speak Iroquoian but all happen to speak Cree here in fact but who would notice anyway) the male captives are forced to run the gauntlet in their captor's village. Once, badly battered, of course, they had survived this indeed pretty brutal initiation procedure, I , having at least a superficial knowledge of Iroquois culture, prepared myself for wittnessing the usual next step, the adoption of all captives into the tribe. I soon learned that the makers of the film seemed to have an agenda which would not permit such a less than traumatic ending.It is towards the end that an ambitious yet heavily slanted portrayal of culture clash tilts into point-blank atrocity propaganda. Portraying matriarchic Iroqois societiy with its democratic decision making processes as a male-commandeered dictatorship is in itself a surprising failure given Beresford's claim to show everything "the way it really was". One wonders if this distortive rendering of Iroquois social life occurred unintentionally. How could they get such basic things so wrong? However, this appears like a lesser evil compared to the what we are supposed to learn of the treatment of captives by Iroqois. Captured women and children were regularly adopted into the tribe. In fact the Iroqois waged numerous wars on neighbours and absorbed their vanquished foes through something that amounted to genocide by hostile takeover, if you like. There was a time when 25,000 out of 35,000 Iroquois were adopted former enemies. The biggest indian killers of the time were disease, not war. Tribes replenished their thinned-out ranks with captured enemies and could hardly afford to kill them "unnecessarily". Male captives were in for a tougher ride and were only adopted after having endured the gauntlet.The film shows none of this. Instead, the captured boy has his throat cut before his father's eyes for no apparent reason - exept "Indian savagery" which is, by definition, beyond any rationality. The captured woman is announced to be tortured to death the next day. The same fate awaits the male captives - although they just passed the initiation rite. One previous commentator hoped that the research done for the scenes in the Iroquois village was profound. Well, it was not. In fact, the makers of the film got everything beyond mere outfits wrong here. This is certainly not "a sensitive and earnest portrayal of Indians" as one previous reviewer reasoned.At the end the film raises "the profound question" if it was right to bring the light of Christianity to the Hurons since they were later on "annihilated" by their heathen Iroquois enemies (in reality parts of the survivors were adopted into the tribe, others formed the influental Wiandot nation). What the film fails to mention is that it was hardly a Christian "turn the other cheek" attitude that brought about the demise of the Hurons but the fact that only partial conversion of the Hurons occurred which split the disease-stricken nation at a time of war when unity was most needed and that the French had chosen the Hurons as their allies and prime proxy fighters in the "Beaver Wars" against their Iroquois enemies - and finally let them down militarily when the Hurons needed their support (For some reading check out [...]).How to rate such a film? Five stars for its technical merits. One star for its often distortive, elaborate defamation of Native cultures. I think that the latter weighs more heavily than the former. Two stars. See it. Carefully. I rented it. I wouldn't buy it.
I purchased these speakers for my teen-aged son for use with his PS3/TV. They are pretty darn loud, with a clear, crisp like sound. He loves the booming surround sound they put out while playing Rainbow 6/Call of Duty and the many other games he plays, simply put...they rock the house.
It is very difficult to form any objective impression of this film's quality by reading reviews because opinion is so divided. Some reviewers call it a highly skilled work while others deride it. In particular, it is the stunning plot twist with about 15 minutes left that split opinion.Before I watched it, the divisiveness and controversy intrigued me, together with the whole premise of inviting an evil female child into your home.My review seeks to bring some "objectivity" into the discussion.Nine-year old Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) is adopted by Kate (Vera Farmiga) and John (Peter Sarsgaard), a couple who are struggling to come to terms with the loss of their third child, who was stillborn. Their first two children are still very young, and they look to adopt another child in search of healing, not only for the loss of their child, but for a rift in their marriage.Esther charms them at the orphanage, and they fall in love with her. After they take her home, there are increasing signs that "there's something wrong with Esther". She moves about strangely at night and displays a shocking vindictiveness towards other children. Layer after layer of her mysterious past is expertly unravelled by the film's makers as violent act by violent act plays itself out, culminating in the most stunning revelation near the end.In order to enjoy this film, you must be open-minded and imaginative. You must be willing to suspend your disbelief more than usual in a work of fiction. Some things in this film will stretch your belief to the limit, but if you're open-minded and remind yourself that this world can be bizarre and confounding, you will better enjoy the intense, wicked ride this movie takes you on.What did I love about the film? Firstly, the character of Esther is distinctly different from the evil figure in other horror films; she is a more human character than, say, the Antichrist in 'Omen'. This film is a psychological, not supernatural, horror and Esther actually draws some sympathy for being victimised at school for being "different". Many of us are familiar with this feeling. The film portrays Esther as a deeply disturbed, yet gifted, person wrestling fiercely with her demons, and makes it deeply challenging for the viewer to judge her as merely "evil". Many in the audience even relate to her, which makes 'Orphan' that much more intriguing and a moral challenge.The film is more likely to interest you if you have an interest in psychology, including mental illness and marital relationship issues.Secondly, it is visually stunning, incredibly artistic and compelling - a true work of art. Many of the most disturbing images are also the most creative and evocative, often even beautiful in a twisted kind of way. The director is brilliant with camera angles and movements to create a persistent, clinging sense of unease in the story.That leads me to my third praise: it builds tension right from the start, and absolutely refuses to let up. Through camera movements that constantly create a sinister feeling, through music that ever so subtly creeps under your skin, through a succession of troubling omens leading up to Esther's adoption, the film's creators keep you on the edge from start to finish, which is what a horror film should do but very few actually manage to.Isabelle Fuhrman puts in a riveting performance as Esther. Farmiga and Sarsgaard are also very impressive, and the issues in their marriage add to the rich psychological depth of this film. Innocent little Maxine, played by the adorable Aryana Engineer, is a brilliant foil to the malevolent Esther.
This movie was interesting for the first 15-30 minutes. After that, I began to wonder why I should care about these characters. It was so-oo-oo slow!!I will say that it did provide some insight into what life in East Germany was like. But it was one view, only. There was no attempt to provide any variation or a larger view outside of the main character's life.The most interesting part of the movie for me was the disintegration of the main character's marriage. To me, that made the most sense since I found the ranting angst of the architects to be rather thin and repetitive.
Listening to blues right now, good sound, very clean, bass is tight and not exaggerated, vocals are good. Might be missing a bit at the high end.They sound pretty good coming out of my guitar amp.Noise isolation is very good, and they are light and comfortable.Really a very good set of phones for under $20.
The camera boasts lots of features and a decent price, however Canon has omitted one very important feature that is very crucial to some users such as myself- It has no ability (per the Canon Service Reps) to have the video pass- thru without having the on-screen data shown on the recieving end (such as on a video switcher). The only way to get that data off is to RECORD your video. We needed to use the camera for sending a live video feed, but alas, we were not able to get the on screen info to not show on the final feed destination. The Canon rep said that this is the only video camera that he has seen without the proper menu options to correct this.Other than that, the video quality appeard to be very nice.
Everything And Nothing is a well-balanced overview of the vocal side of David Sylvian's post-Japan career. While there's bound to be some arguing over what was and was not included, all of Sylvian's major album projects - the four solo albums, Rain Tree Crow, and Sylvian/Fripp - are represented, as are collaborations with Ryuichi Sakamoto, Mick Karn, and Alesini &amp; Andreoni. Then, of course, there some unreleased tracks, as well a couple of Japan tracks (one of which was previously unreleased).The only real missteps are the new version of &quot;Ghosts&quot;, ruined by a re-recorded vocal track that lacks much of the emotional tension of the original, and stripped by the removal of its intro, which in the original version sets the mood for what follows; and the remixed version of &quot;Bamboo Houses&quot;, which includes a couple of superfluous elements either not found or not emphasized in the original mix.Otherwise, despite being a compilation, Everything And Nothing is a welcome return to form. The outtakes from the Dead Bees On A Cake sessions are often more interesting than what made it onto the album, particularly &quot;The Scent Of Magnolia&quot; (which should have been a single) and &quot;Cover Me With Flowers&quot;. The remixed versions of &quot;Heartbeat (Tainai Kaiki II)&quot; and &quot;The Golden Way&quot; are both sparser than the original mixes, with &quot;The Golden Way&quot; in particular given an edge that the original lacked.The songs that are not otherwise remixed or given new vocal tracks benefit from remastering, particularly the Rain Tree Crow tracks (&quot;Blackwater&quot;, &quot;Every Colour You Are&quot; and &quot;Cries And Whispers&quot;). &quot;Laugher And Forgetting&quot;, which segued into &quot;Before The Bullfight&quot; on Gone To Earth, here segues into the remixed version of &quot;Buoy&quot;, the 1987 collaboration with Mick Karn that subsequently appeared as the b-side of &quot;Let The Happiness In&quot;.Listeners who found themselves disappointed by last year's Dead Bees On A Cake should find Everything And Nothing to be well worth the wait.
My beautiful Scottie (almost 12 years old) killed this within an hour of letting her have it. To be fair, I have found very few that can withstand her powerful bite, thought for the money - this shold have lasted longer!
Jonathan Drake has it right in his review.Aside from the poor picture quality, the originalsoundtrack has been so filtered that the backgroundmusic drops out when dialogue stops.I have seen this serial in 35mm and it was superbon all counts. Too bad it has been ruined.
I think Doctor Who fans underrate "The Sunmakers" - possibly because it's a crude-looking serial, with (intentionally?) bland sets and extensive location shooting on an ugly factory rooftop. Plus, the dialog and performances are over-the-top; so, if you don't like in-your-face satire delivered by means of ham acting, you might not like this.Fortunately, I'm a huge fan of ham (not to mention cheese), obvious satire (so long as I agree with it), and Baroque dialog - so I've loved "The Sunmakers" ever since I was a kid. I don't even mind the visual blandness of the production, because it fits with the story's general atmosphere of oppression and drudgery.The plot concerns an evil corporation (simply called "The Company") that has "bought out" the entire human race for use as a slave labor force on Pluto. The Company suppresses any rebellious spirit among the human population by pumping an anxiety-inducing gas into the air, and by generally exhausting people with back-breaking labor and excessive taxes. When the Doctor and his companion Leela arrive, they quickly size up the situation and decide to help the humans overthrow their cruel corporate masters.Of course, such a story can't help being very political. Some people think "The Sunmakers" has right-wing politics, because it satirizes the tax policies of Britain's (then) Labour government. However, the serial is also an obvious attack on corporations, and at one point the Doctor paraphrases The Communist Manifesto, so there are definitely elements of left-wing political commentary here as well. (In general, it's tough to pin down the politics of the writer, Robert Holmes; another serial that he wrote, "The Two Doctors," also seems to blend liberal and conservative philosophy.) Anyway, all of these political angles are covered in a pretty intelligent manner in the DVD's "making-of" special.Politics aside, "The Sunmakers" is a standout serial because of Tom Baker's hilarious antics; the presence of Louise Jameson as Leela, arguably the toughest and best-acted companion ever; and the almost unbelievably weird and slimy performance of Henry Woolf as the evil Collector. They all act in a very theatrical way - as I said above, many would consider them over-the-top - but I find all of their performances delightful, and a nice contrast to the oh-so-serious and boring acting favored in more recent sci-fi shows like X-Files and Star Trek: The Next Generation. In short, these actors - and indeed this whole production - are campy in the best way.Oh, and the DVD is pretty good, too. The documentary features and the commentary are livened up by Louise Jameson's obvious enthusiasm for this story. Tom Baker, meanwhile, makes his usual eccentric contribution to the commentary - bursting into laughter at random moments, pointing out the attractive women on screen, etc. It's too bad that Robert Holmes isn't still around to contribute his two cents on the story, but you can't have everything...
A favorite of mine. Viewed so much lost count and will again. Knew nothing of Amish until this and the whole thing works brilliantly. Set the standard for others to follow and does not date. Harrison Ford could not have been better.
While most would seek out DMSO for very painful muscles, rheumatoid arthritis, and other issues (okay, horses...yeah...that's what it was made for...horses with muscle pain but it's typically used on humans so you can substitute "I" in this review with "my horse" if you like.The side-effect always encountered with DMSO is that, because it penetrates the skin, you wind up tasting it's odd oniony garlic odor in your mouth. And smelling it. In fact, when DMSO was being tested to treat pain, they had extreme difficulty doing a double-blind study because it was obvious who used the placebo and who got the real stuff...by their breath. So they knew if they had the placebo very quickly. As everyone who uses it gets a whiff. However, for someone in pain, they don't much care about garlic.While this has the odd odor, it appears to be more scented than the natural DMSO that carries the odor through your body. It never penetrated. It never wound up in my breath. Smelly stuff sitting on my skin doesn't do much for me other than make me stink.Now you may feel I've been had in quality (there is, afterall, lots of fake DMSO out there) but that goes without question once you get the DMSO. It says it's pure 99.85% gel. Notice that wording. Yes the GEL is 99.85%. The DMSO is not.Guess what it says on the label "Sold for use as a mild solvent only"Note: the packaging label on the picture they posted is not the jar you will get. I will post a picture of the actual jar they ship which calls it a mild solvent and says gel 90% and upload it to the picture page.Yep! You are buying GEL. DMSO is no mild solvent. it appears as though they took some 99.85% DMSO and combined it with 90% gel by the label....creating a very mild solvent of 10% DMSO.I'd doubt this except for the fact that it didn't work and never penetrated the skin, much like those in the double blind study on the placebo.DMSO actually cures my poison ivy which is why I have it...I have a wildlife habitat and if there is poison ivy out there I find it when I'm working to help the animals. This did nothing.Watch out for clever wording. Here you are buying gel. For too much money for just inactive filler material.Better to find 99% DMSO rather than 99.85% DMSO dissolved in 90% of the container being gel in order to create a "mild solvent" as the label tells you once you read it.Note: The picture the seller shows on this page is not the DMSO they will ship you. I will take an actual photo and upload it today of the one saying it's just a mild solvent and 90% gel. This is a completely different item than they shipped to me.
Note to Hollywood:Just because you CAN do it with computer graphics, it doesn't mean you SHOULD.This movie was great right up to the point the narrator dies, and then it IMMEDIATELY devolved into complete unwatchable garbage -- and with some of the most inane visuals you've ever seen.I bet the author was crushed to see what they did with her book, and the young actress was fantastic, but that's not going to transfer to the phone ringing for more work after this bomb.
These are really nice hair sticks and quite the cool item being steel.They are not as large as many hair sticks but they do hold well. Also being steel they are very intriguing as visions as MI-6 tricks by using them as some sort of secret weapon.Also they wont break or smudge if they get wet! I polished them with stainless steel polish and they were quite shiny!
What is "Gordano Bruno and the Hermetic tradition"?Let me put it very simply: it is a succession of clumsily written reviews of the main Hermetic treatises, starting with the original manuscripts brought over from Byzantium after its fall and ending with the works of Bruno, Campanella and other more recent thinkers and magicians. Each chapter deals with a book or a series of books by one or several Hermeticists. Yates dutifully summarizes the book, adds a few more or less enlightened comments and biographical notes and then moves on to examine the writings of the following Renaissance crank. She makes a copious use of quotations, most of them in Latin and most of them not translated...I want to make something very clear: this is by no way a biography of Bruno. It is not even an intellectual biography of the "Nolan philosopher": nowhere are we told by Yates why, when and how he became a Hermeticist.In fact, she starts her exposition on him when he is already a full-fledged magus in Paris, where he is trying to engratiate himself with King Henri III by publishing a treatise on mnemonics. The whole first chapter dealing with Bruno is an outline of that book. The following chapter describes another book and so on. Briefly, we never leave the libraries...If you are looking for a insights into how Hermeticism influenced Renaissance painting, music, architecture and other aspects of civilization, you won't find them here. I repeat, this is a description of the Hermetic literature of the XVIth century in Italy and elsewhere, with a focus on the books written by Bruno.You may now ask: OK, I understand that this is not a biography about Bruno. Does Yates do a good job in explaining the Hermetic treatises?Would you believe a "History of Western Scientific Thought" written by a Tunguse shaman from Krasnoiarsk ? My guess is that you would at the very least take his exposition with quite a handful of salt.The reason is obvious: a Siberian sorcerer belongs to a world that is too different from ours to be able to really understand Newtonian science. And even if he could understand it, his own religious and cultural background is so hostile to mechanistic science that he is bound to be biased in his treatment of the subject.Now why should one trust an account of Hermetic philosophy and its influence on XVIth century Catholic thinkers written by a modern historian coming from a Protestant and rationalistic tradition?I for one do not believe that such a historian is capable of dealing properly with such a subject and Mrs Yates being precisely the modern, rationalistic, Protestant historian I am talking about(otherwise she would not be an award-winning sacred cow, see what happens to truly great but marginal historians like Hillaire Belloc who are writing from a Catholic perspective) fails in giving a truly enlightening, living picture of Hermeticism and Giordano Bruno.To put it very simply, she does not understand what she is talking about! That is the reason why we get all those insipid summaries worthy of a first year college student.Furthermore, although she shows on the whole more respect toward her characters than your average historian, Yates does regard the Hermetic thinkers of the Renaissance, including Bruno, as a bunch of crackpots and megalomaniacs. Deeply interesting they are but still they are crackpots as all pre-Reformation, pre-Enlightenment thinkers are bound to be in the mind of a mainstream Western historian.Just see how she starts her book in a typical fashion: by condescendingly exposing the superstitious attitude of the ancients. Ficino, Pico, Bruno, they all believed that the Hermetic literature had been written at the time of the pyramids, before Moses! But, aha, WE know that they are in fact nothing more than pious forgeries dating from the 2nd century AD! Casaubon, an obscure Protestant Greek scholar of Swiss origin living in England has proved it. Never mind this bigot had a huge axe to grind, never mind Pico and Ficino, who believed in the remote antiquity of the Hermetic manuscripts, mastered the Greek language just as well as Casaubon, we should believe the Calvinist philologist because...because he comforts our prejudices, of course!To say that there is absolutely nothing to be learnt from "Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition" would of course be a gross exaggeration, for there are interesting pieces of information scattered throughout the book, specially when the author manages to raise her nose from her nine-point summaries and laborious sketches to give us a larger view of the fascinating world of the Renaissance but this is really such a minor aspect of "Giordano Bruno?that I wouldn't recommend it for that reason.Much better to read Adrian Gilbert's The New Jerusalem", believe me.
This could've been a simple "Woe is Me" type film, but Shirley Booth brings it to another level.Shirley Booth stars as Alma Duval, a woman who is cheat on, not only by her husband, but life in general.What makes this a classic is Booth's performance. At the film's start Booth makes you truly feel for Alma. You can really sympathize with her plight but by the time the movie ends, Alma's self pitying and self-loathing almost makes you feel she got what she deserved.Only Booth could pull that off. Makig you feels such sorry for the character then turning it all around by the end of the film. I wish this would come out on DVD
Received jacket in 2 DAYS! Used it the following weekend for a Mountain ride...Jacket was awesome...kept me warm and was great looking too...definitely recommend!
Of the 114 recipes in the meat of the book (excluding the last sections on bread and desserts,), 47 of them(or over 40%) have incomplete ingredient lists. These 47 recipes call for using Emeril's Essence or a similar mystery spice mix. Thus, you face cooking these 47 recipes without knowing how to recreate them.It's as if he told you to "put in a couple of tablespoons of some seasonings", because what's in the various Emeril Essence products isn't revealed. Not too professional.Should be titled "How to Cook with Emeril's Seasoning Mix You Have to Buy, Instead of Your Own Seasonings".
Uh, this is actually a very easy to use book - though i suppose having a brain might help a little - what's wrong with using the index? Every film reviewed is listed by title in alphabetical order along with its respective page number . . . flip to the page in question, and VIOLA!! Simple, efficient, and about as remedial as it gets . . .AND the contents of the book are fantastic - an extremely broad and eclectic array of films are covered, all reviewed with pith and wit, blessedly without the stale academic dictionary approach of so many other movie guides. The arrangement is unique, simple, and clever: how many times have you been in the video store not looking for anything in particular, but with a general idea what TYPE of movie you want? Well, next time, before you even leave the house, you can just open to section corresponding with your desired film-type and scan through it, picking out a few possible promising-looking titles to search for once you get to the rental spot.Be warned however, this is NOT a comprehensive movie guide, nor is it meant to be - there are some really blatant ommissions. But at the same time there is such an awesome wealth of classical knowledge combined with esoterica in here that one is virtually guaranteed a plethora of great and enlightening cinematic discoveries for years and years to come. This is GENUINE film scholarship compiled by true film buffs who clearly love and enjoy turning others onto good movies. I couldn't recomend it more!!
Considering every reviewer seems to give this five stars and call this the best biography ever, here is my two cents. Firstly Manchester is a great writer and I have a lot of time for him (for example his biography of MacArthur is breathtaking) and so this, of course, is very well written and researched. It also covers a very important period in history, the 1930s of appeasement, and an indispensable man, Churchill. In fact the first half, detailing the appeasers victories over Churchill and his increasing marginalisation in British affairs, is perfect and fascinating. My problem is that after about 1936 Churchill disappears altogether, to be replaced by a fairly perfunctory recounting of the historical events - Anchloss, Munich, the Nazi-Soviet Anti-aggression pact - that are more dramatically covered in William Shirer's "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich" (Shirer's description of Munich is breathtaking). Why? Because from about 1936-39 Hitler was the main, the only, player on the stage and so accounts of his actions are more interesting than those of Churchill (writing, touring the Maginot Line, complaining to British lawmakers about their lack of backbone).
Creature was partially filmed at Edward Ball Wakulla Springs State Park in Northwest Florida just south of Tallahassee. If you should ever be in the area, you must visit the park. It is a totally protected site and a park ranger will take you down the river on a small pontoon boat. They will show you the site where portions of the movie was filmed and if you're lucky will add all kinds of tidbits about the filming. Such as when the Creature is swimming in the water, it is actually an employee of the park rather than an actor. If you are a Tarzan fan, several of the Johnny Weissmuller films were also made there.pk
It still entertains. The Crab is a much better book then I originally thought it would be. This novel shows the side of the Crab Clan and their actions during the Clan Wars. The Crabs were the main antagonistic group during the Clan War, but as you read this novel you will find the actions, thoughts, feelings, sacrifices, and reasons why they left the wall of Roukugan and joined with the Shadowland creatures.There are some events in this novel that might be of interest to fans.1.) The novel touches and tells the story of the rivalry between Yakamo and Hitomi. Their two battles, and even the initial fight between Yakamo and Hitomi's brother which started their feud.2.) The day Kisada lost his Tetsubo to the great oni, and entered the Shadowlands with his army to retrieve it back.3.) The battle of Beiden Pass.--Along with the Great Bear (Kisada) his sons Yakamo and Sukune are main characters in the novel as well as Kuni Yori. Hido O-ushi makes a few appearances in this book, but is mostly a minor character.--For those who are fans of the world of legend of the five rings, the Crab is a novel which you will enjoy.
I first read Amy Tan's book 'The Kitchen God's Wife' so many years ago I can't remember the year. I have a copy on my bookshelf, together with 'The Joy Luck Club'.Not having great knowledge about the Chinese people except through TV, the book presented a view of Chinese life in an accessible way. Because it's been so long since I've read the book, the storyline is hazy, except I know I really loved the way the book ended on a really positive note.I have been looking for a Kindle edition of this book for a long time, and was so excited to find it that I down-loaded it straight away. Now all I need is the time to read the story again, but read it again I will - you can depend on it.
It's fits perfectly. It's easy to wire, it's quiet, it blows. It was the best price I could find and it works. 'Nough said.
This deserves 5 stars but I had some disc sticking/freezing issues also-this seems to be a regular problem with double sided discs, no matter where I play it. This is one of the best crime series I have watched and truly stands the test of time. I love the storylines, Quincy's ability to always stir up trouble in search of the truth and his well connected, politically correct boss's annoyed acceptance of the fact that Quincy will always do the right thing no matter how much trouble it causes, and ultimately is always supported in the end. Sadly, the rogue but honest, hard working, stellar employee is not as acceptable in this "go along to get along" everyone should be and look and act exactly as the boss says with no semblance of a personality or conscience in this lovely day and age. It's a shame that honest whistle blowers (not the make it up to get back at my employer types)or the honest person who says "I can't ignore that" or "I can't do that" is usually seen as the "uncooperative", "insubordinate", "bad" employee these days by the company, the media, the government, everyone, rather than the one person with values, morals, and the guts to say "that's just wrong" or against the law. Growing up, in a less PC world, people were people, had personality, dressed differently (but within a professional, unwritten code)and could have courage like Quincy and still have a job...these days, when you stand up for truth or justice, it's less acceptable, more scary, more likely you won't have a job tomorrow just for giving an alternate opinion.okay, the I love Quincy and the ways of yesteryear rant is over......but I love Quincy.Can I just say, as a child of the 70's.....The song is the greatest!!! Gives me that cozy childhood feeling!
I have been a fan of Graham Masterton's fiction for a number of years now, since I first came across his work when just a schoolboy. This is certainly a very entertaining horror read, and engages the reader on many levels.Masterton is a master of mood and setting, and here he perfectly captures the air of an English summer on the Isle of Wight, in the midst of which stands Fortyfoot House with all it's menace...The evil presence of a being known popularly to locals as Brown Jenkin, part giant rat, part human, scurries through the walls of the house, twittering and calling in the darkness. Strange lights and sounds come from the attic at night. Why did so many children die in the space of a few days at Fortyfoot House in November 1886? Why is the roof constructed in such a bizarre fashion, so that it's angles appear...impossible?Masterton has drawn heavily from the Cthulhu Mythos originated by classic writer H. P. Lovecraft for this story. At first I was dismayed that he did this, as I am thoroughly versed in the original canon. My fear was that he would take such liberties as to ruin my enjoyment of this book, despite being such a Masterton fan. However, with reflection I do not see it as a problem at all. Sure, he has taken huge liberties with Cthulhu Mythos lore, but why not? Too many people are too precious about it. Besides, the constant addition and taking of liberties only serve to enhance and contribute further to the cycle. While this novel is certainly fringe-Mythos, it is still a fantastic read. And you cannot ask for more than that.With plenty of gory detail to satisfy without overpowering you, Masterton has written another great horror tale. A classic horror page turner.
I've been really getting into travelogues lately, mostly because I cannot afford to travel nearly as much as I'd like.The American southwest embodies a mythical place in my head. I suppose it's because whenever I fly to Nevada or California (via a short layover in Phoenix, which I never get to explore), I'm awed at how much of this country is truly and utterly empty. Which of course makes me want to 1) learn all about it; and 2) move there pronto. Barring the latter, as Ohio is not yet done sucking the life out of me, I've had to settle for the former.This is some serious southwest - not the midwestern housewife's dream once she's realized she'd rather be doing something else, something involving crystals and flowy clothes (a la Taos, NM). This is the southwest where the border with Mexico is just a vague idea, and people eek out a meager living in the middle of the freakin' desert.Miller writes with Edward Abbey's fondness for this last American frontier, and even includes his own meetings with Abbey in the narrative. Where Miller differs though is that he writes about the people of the southwest, and their intimate relationship with the land, and each other (the section on Bisbee is particularly engaging).I couldn't put this book down, and after completing it, the American southwest is still a mystery in some ways - something that can only be experienced first hand. Though I did learn the likely origin of the dreaded black velvet painting.
This is most definitely the best CD I own. Ever since I heard her Deux album from a good friend in New York, I've been following her stuff. Her Oui album was not that hot; but, this one is just amazingly fantastic. It's perfect for unwinding, and entertaining! Superb, indeed! YOu will most definitely not regret this buy, especially if you're a francophile.
Back in 2006, Warner Bros. released a Sam Peckinpah 4-DVD Westerns box set, featuring acclaimed classics "The Wild Bunch", "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid", "Ride the High Country", and "The Ballad of Cable Hogue". Of these films, "The Ballad of Cable Hogue" is less known, having been placed on the backburner by the studio and released with relatively no publicity following the release of "The Wild Bunch", despite Cable Hogue being filmed before it. "The Ballad of Cable Hogue" begins much like other Peckinpah films: an older man of the Western frontier, wronged and tossed around by younger gunslingers, only to be left alone and left to die while vowing revenge if he lives. Seemingly, Hogue will veer down the road familiar to Peckinpah, a revenge fantasy in a changing Western frontier, where the old ways are being pushed aside in favor of modernity. Then the film does a 180, turning into a farcical sex romp comedy (brought about by a priest!). A welcome change of pace given Peckinpah's oeuvre. Which isn't to say his other films are devoid of humor; he often injects it among his most violent fare as a mean of lightening the dark mood. But to structure a whole film as a comedy would appear to be beyond Peckinpah's grasp yet it feels remarkably like a Peckinpah film.The final act sees his favorite themes reemerge: revenge and modernity. Where in his other films the main character would get his revenge culminating in a bloody shootout, here Peckinpah turns this expectation on its head, forgiving a man that wronged him and in fact rewarding him after feeling sorry for him. The theme of modernity is also addressed by Peckinpah. Represented by a car, Peckinpah has Hogue face the changing landscape of the West with comical results. "The Ballad of Cable Hogue" is a welcome departure from Peckinpah's moody and sometimes overused violence, a Western comedy that refuses to take itself seriously. Highly recommended
I have been a big fan of Card's since reading Ender's Game. After that book, Card wrote three others in which he finished the story of Ender - Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide and Children of the MInd). The first two sequels are far inferior to Ender's Game. They are not all that bad of themselves, but fall short of all other books in the series. I have not read Children of the Mind, but since it is a continuation of books 2 and 3 I doubt that I will.Now, with Ender's Shadow, (the 5th in the series) Card reverts back to the same styly and inagination that made Ender's Game such a classic. This book is fully as enjoyable as Ender'g Game. I have read Ender's Shadow twice - knowing what is coming does nothing to detract from the beauty of Card's story telling. In it, Card tells the same story told in Ender's Game, but this time it is told fom the point of view of Bean, his second in command. it is fascinating to follow Bean's journy throughbook the story. You need not have read Ender's Game to enjoy Ender's Shadow, but it is recommended.I can not recommend this Ender's Shadow highly enough. For those interested, I have listed below all 8 books in the series below.1. Ender's Game2. Speaker for the Dead3. Xenocide4. Children fo the Mind (end of the Ender subseries)5. Ender's Shadow6. Shadow of the Hegemon7. Shadow Puppets8. Shadow of the Giant (apparently the end of the Shadow {Bean} subseries.
Will not buy this movie till it comes out in it's original aspect ratio, 2.35. MGM, how comes this one is coming out in pan and scan when most of your others are wide screen?
Your Imagination will run wild.&quot;Maybe our generation has found its Don DeLillo.&quot;-Bret Easton Ellis&quot;Among sick puppies, Palahniuk is the top dog....A unique talent.&quot;-People&quot;Palahniuk is one of the freshest, most intriguing voices to appear in a long time.&quot;-Newsday&quot;Dark riffing on modernity is the reason people read Palahniuk. His books are not so much novels as jagged fables, cautionary tales about the creeping peril represented by almost everything.&quot;-Time
This tree/bush pruner is really great. I have a half acre with a wide variety of trees. Apple and Pear trees are a snap with this baby. Over grown rose of sharon is no problem. Oak does take a little longer to get through but hey, I'm not standing on a ladder sawing the old fasioned way and breaking a blade. I fully recommend this item. I have the blower/vac, hedge trimmer and snow thrower attachments for my Ryobi and this pruner really takes the place of a small chain saw. It comes with 2 blades and the strap. Get it if you have bushes and trees and ryobi/john deere/craftsman.
I am sick of these Hollywood remakes of Japanese horror films. When the Ring came out I think that most people were genuinely intrigued and held in suspense as the concept was original to most American viewers. Five or six years later Hollywood has milked this genre dry.They all have the same central theme. One or several people are brutally killed and a spirit is left behind in our world to continue to rack up the body count. From there an attractive female star enlists the help of an attractive male assistant to track down the source of the spirit and save both of their lives (and sometimes even the whole world!).It is all the same thing over and over again. If I wanted to watch a sub-genre of horror films that recycles the same plot dozens of times I would watch another zombie movie. Do not get me wrong and think that I am condemning zombie movies because I'm actually a huge fan of them. What I am not a fan of are these glorified ghosts. Rather than spending several million dollars on multiple ghost movies that are nothing but corny remakes of mediocre Japanese movies they should spend that money on zombie movies.
With stunning emotion and a roaring message against apathy, What I Have to Give, Let it Be Enough is easily one of the top debut albums of 2006. Stylistically After the Sirens sounds like what might happen if Dead Poetic, late-career Further Seems Forever, and Fall Out Boy had a car crash and forgot which band they were in.Opening up is the short introduction-like "White Noise with Grace Notes," the album really gets started with the hammering drums of "We Buy Jewelry When the Love Runs Out" and the upbeat "Song That Holds Us Still." All this is well and good, but things really pick up with the rowdy opening of "Oh, For Eyes of Glass," a rollercoaster of a song that finds hardcore-ish double-bass kicking by drummer Jason Lefever. While vocalist Ryan Heidorn attacks the Church's apathy and inaction:Well, I'll give my moneyIf they ask of me,But I won't give my clean body.The least of these is not the least of my worriesPicking up from there is the equally apathy attacking "Prayers as Donations," except this time its aimed at ignorance of international poverty:I'm tired of seeing you boxed upIn cardboard and army fatigueAnd I'll be walking around you so lightly,Hoping that you won't disturb me from making my retreat.The theme continues on the awe-inspiring "Curare on Your Lips," a song that starts with an almost rave-like electro beat that moves into a metallic drumming head banging session as Heidorn's vocals are expertly sampled throughout the track. The latter of half of the album dabbles in acoustic guitars with "Instead of Beauty, Branding," and the intense "Lights At Nero's Party," finally closing with the piano ballad, "A Waning."After the Sirens brand of rock brims with variety (which is never a bad problem to have in today's convoluted music world), and each track brings something different to the table. The lyrics are beautifully written, the drumming (did I mention the drumming?!) powerful, and the guitars piercing. A band to watch, I'll be looking for the next album from these Massachusetts-bred rockers.
This is a very good intro to ethics and meta-ethics. Singer is a good writer and his piece at the beginning is almost worth the price of the book alone. It's more of an overview of the classic texts than a state of the art primer on modern research (e.g. the newest primate studies, psychological / neuroscience based studies, etc.).... then again it was written in 1994. Anyway, a good book if you want to read up on classic texts, but might want to go elsewhere for newer stuff.
No hay raz&oacute;n, como est&aacute;n las cosas en el mundo financiero y editorial actualmente, para que la publicaci&oacute;n en Argentina de la maravillosa obra de una excelsa venezolana como Conny Mendez, CUESTE UN 40% M&Aacute;S que la publicada en Venezuela. Por el contrario, deber&iacute;a costar MENOS... much&iacute;simo menos!

Much like the Old Hat compilation of records from Joe Bussard's collection ("Down In The Basement"), this 2-CD set is a hodge-podge of old-time string bands, blues, a little jazz, and other so-called "roots" music from the 1920s and early 1930s. This is rare stuff indeed--most of it unavailable on CD elsewhere, and you can forget finding copies of the original 78s! Fortunately, the transfers by Rich Nevins are marvelous; computerized "reprocessing" has been kept to a minimum and these records sound like they should: bright, clear, and natural. Yes, there's a little surface noise, but the serious record collector shouldn't mind that a bit. So many producers of reissues of vintage recoridngs seem to try to remove as much surface noise as possible, leaving recordings that are clean, yes, but dull and lifeless as well. Even with the light crackle, these transfers project a beautiful "presence." The selections are interesting too--I was especially drawn to the Luke Jordan selection ("If I Call You Mama"), Osey Helton's fiddle solo "Green River," and "Bells of Love" by the African-American shape note a-capella group, Middle Georgia Singing Convention No. 1 (and if you like this last group, check out the Document CD "Atlanta, GA Gospel" which includes their complete recorded output). The liner notes that accompany the set are lengthy, but unfortunately they reveal relatively little about the music on these records. The notes are mostly stories of how the records came to be acquired and ramblings about the hobby of collecting in general (not just records!) from producer Rich Nevins. This isn't necessarily bad--it makes for fun reading!--but I'd like to know a bit more about the music. Admittedly, there is probably very little known about the musicians on the recordings, but I'd have liked *something.* Also, as others have pointed out, there's no discography: no recording dates or locations, no matrix numbers, no issue numbers, no personnel listings, nada. In a set so clearly targeted to record collectors, this seems inexcusable. In addition, I'm disappointed in the DVD case-shaped packaging, which while elegant and attractive, doesn't store easily with the rest of my CDs. I would have much preferred a standard 2-CD double case. Because of the way the packaging has been made, it's often difficult for me to slide the booklet back into its paper pocket: the bottom frequently gets snagged on the cardboard foldover inside the pocket (something that could have easily been avoided with more standard packaging). Still, on the whole, this is a remarkable set making available some outstanding records in really outstanding sound. Every 78 rpm record collector should be delighted with it--I certainly am.
BJ Daniels continues the Texas Confidential series with this month's first secret child book and amnesia story in &quot;The Agent's Secret Child.&quot; Six years after the woman he loved died in a fiery explosion, agent Jake Cantrell receives a call from a five year old child, a child who calls him father. Her mother bears a striking resemblance to Abby Diaz, the love of his life. She claims to have no memory of her life before the last six years. Could she be Abby, and can he keep her and her daughter safe from the drug lord who wants them dead?The title and the expected happy ending shouldn't make it too hard to answer those questions. &quot;The Agent's Secret Child&quot; is told with enough energy and emotion to make it an exciting and refreshing read. Though the circumstances of Jake not knowing about his daughter are contrived, they were at least unique and didn't turn me against one of the characters. Anyone who is tired of secret child books, and I've complained enough about them, should know this is the first in a while that didn't aggravate me. Daniels makes Abby's slow discovery of her identity quite poignant. Jake and Abby's relationship is full of passion. This is a romance many readers will cheer for. The action never stops moving, and the equally strong hero and heroine prove their strength more than once. The mystery is well done, with juicy secrets to be uncovered and some nice investigating on the part of the heroine. The climax was slightly familiar (see last year's &quot;My Lover's Secret,&quot; Intrigue 528) and one final twist so obvious it only made one of our heroes look stupid. Honestly, how else could it have turned out? The romance and suspense are still both consistently high and strong enough to make this one a winner.This book could easily have been five stars (right now it's a solid four and a half) if it had been longer. (Unless you're interested in a really nitpicky point, stop reading now and go buy the book). This isn't only a book where readers will say they wished it was longer. It needed to be. &quot;The Agent's Secret Child&quot; is 233 pages, fifteen less than the average Intrigue, with huge margins and big type. (Temptation length. Why isn't it Temptation priced?) There isn't any place where the emotions or details couldn't have been expanded upon for greater effect. The Texas Confidential agency especially could use more detail. Two books into the series and the agency is still vaguely defined. Too many of the agency characters and background details are offered in quick one line descriptions that read like this is how her editor or the other authors described them to her. They aren't her characters, so Daniels has no idea who they are and isn't going to bother with them any more than she has to. For instance, the author keeps mentioning another agent who disappeared a year ago. This probably will come into play later in the series, but Jake thinks about this so casually and unemotionally that it seems to have no impact on him or his coworkers. It's only going to make it less effective if this plot point comes up in the future, and makes me wonder why Jake would bother thinking about it if he cares so little. It's a very minor point but a crucial one. It says &quot;Texas Confidential&quot; isn't holding up well as a series. (All the ads say these agents are cowboys by day. We have yet to see them do anything cowboy-related.) It's not like Daniels doesn't have room to add more detail. The book could have been expanded, and should have been.I have no problem recommending &quot;The Agent's Secret Child&quot; highly. The central relationship and suspense are wonderful. Only the foundation the book and the series are set up on are too fuzzy around the edges. For top notch romantic suspense, this is still one book that should not be missed.
Moobli. Ridiculous name for a dog, if you ask me. However, what a dog and what a life. The author decides he needs a dog to help and companion him during his self inflicted lonliness in the middle of the last wilderness in Britain. From the beginning, when the puppy cannot take his eyes off Tomkies, to the inevitably sad ending, we read the diary of a magnificent beast and its intense relationship with the one human he knows.It is brilliant escapism for the reader because we know it is true. We feel acutely the pain that Moobli will have felt the one time he is physically punished by Tomkies. And the shame that Tomkies feels afterwards is almost palpable. A rather unusual, and certainly unfashionable, story but one in which the reader can become embroiled and lost within. If it has ever crossed your mind to live in the middle of nowhere, this book will tell whether you could.I finished &quot;Moobli&quot; with a profound sense that I knew the dog personally. This book made me realise the special bond between man and dog. It made me miss my dog.
This album is a total disappointment. I heard many good things about this album from fans of Weezer and just critics altogether. I really don't get a lot of people are raving about this album. Although there is nothing significantly wrong with this album the songs just sound boring and repetitive. It is like listening to the same mellow, surf song ten times over. The only song I enjoyed was Killian's Red but the rest of the album you could easily toss away. Basically this album is just boring ... Now I have heard songs from previous Nada Surf albums and if they could have captured their energy of old then they might have come out with a album worth listening to. But until then stay tuned...
If punk ever rock 'n' rolled this is how it would sound! For the love God it's about time this hard workin', hard rockin' band got their due. The opening track "sticky situtation" charges like a GTO on fire with the devil behind the wheel. And just when I was pickin' up my d**k outta the dirt the mango kid enlists ex-Kyuss howler John Garcia on back-up vocals for the song "Invisible", brilliant. Danko is in full bad-boy swagger too, you can just see him lickin' his lips and eyein' the pretty girls in the front row as he tears through a tasteful solo. Compared to AC/DC, Motley Crue, and Kiss (and I'm sure he's not losing any sleep over those comparisons, after all it is the enemy) this album does not stop for ballads or pedestrians and Danko's soulful voice growls like the hounds of hell on amyl nitrate. See them live. Buy the record and rock s**t hot!
.....At one point in the book, she brags about getting $40 from a client. Such is the small scale of the BDSM for hire world.The author has no ability to explain her world to outsiders and doesn't dish the dirt on what filthy stuff she did with her clients. So it's not enlightening OR hot. Yuck.
Typically amazing rage against the machine for the first 6 songs on this cd, after which only average, less inspired songs play. 5 stars for the first half, 3 for the second, the average of which is 4. Hence my rating.
The acting is bad, There are a lot of annoying stock footages, we get a bit lost later in the movie, but who cares? Yeah, its stupid and cheesy, but that's why its so good! Its unintentionally hilarious, the zombies look cool and there are a lot of great gore scenes (especially the one at the end!)! What more do you need? Ok, a lot of people need more, but personally, I don't. Then again, maybe I'm too much of a zombie movie fan, I like a lot of zombie movies just because they're gory, they have pathetic stories and acting, but I don't care!Anyway, you'll probably enjoy this movie if you're an hardcore zombie movie fan, but if you want a good horror movie with a good story and great acting, watch another movie.4/5.
I'll start out by saying this is the 1st lighted make up mirror I have ever had so I don't have much to compare it too but I still can review it & tell you what I think. Maybe it's just me, but it takes a little getting use to using it at 1st. I hated it at 1st because it took up so much space & two of the light settings might as well not even be on there because they are so gaudy looking. So I waited over a month to write a review & I did get use to to it & like it very much. It is bright enough for me (I also turn on the bedroom light while using it). I don't get why anyone would say it's not bright enough because as the title of my review states, you can see every little blemish, unwanted hair, & uneven skin spots on you're face but hey, that's what it's for, was just a little scary at 1st (lol). I personally don't use the side mirrors & wish they weren't there as they just take up space (but some may like them). Out of the 4 settings I use 2. Day & Home. "Office" looks hideous & yellow & "Evening" is just too dark for me. It also comes with an outlet on the base to plug a curling iron in which I really like. So far everything works correctly. Just if you don't need those side mirrors, get one without because it's a space grabber.
I have had a few weeks to listen to this CD at length and I feel I did not even come close to a good review, based on the quality of the CD. So I am deleting the old review and giving this new one in it's place.This CD is Zakk's most mature songwritting and guitar playing of all the BLS CDs. He moved away from the cursing that filled the first 2 BLS CDs (sidenote, cursing does not bother me in the least) and relied on his true talents as opposed to going for over the top lyrics or brain bashing speed. Zakk seems to have matured as a guitar player as well. His playing is at a new level. 1919 Eternal is the best CD I have bought in a very long time. There is something for everyone here. A great mix of fast, slow and ending with an accoustic version of America the Beautiful that will bring a tear to your eye. Zakk and BLS definately have made their masterpiece with this one. Every song is good in it's own way. None are filler. Zakk has also always been able to write and perform great slow songs as well as just kill with his speed and dexterity. He is quite possibly the best singer/guitarist/song writer around. I recommend all of the BLS CDs to anyone. Each has something to offer. I just happen to think 1919 Eternal is their best overall.
This video is a virtual vacation. It highlights the deep cultural heritage of the area and the craftsmanship of the people of Tuscany. If you want to see what is off the beaten path, then invest in this video. You'll watch it time and again.
My original review:------------I have been looking high and low for reliable software for backing up a hard disk to CD-RW's. It has been a frustrating search, and I have donwloaded many different programs to try out. Dantz's Retrospect Express was the first one I've found that actually worked reliably!It's got a good disaster recovery feature (which I hope to never to need to actually use, although I did try booting from their disaster recovery CD and that worked flawlessly), and it recovers individual files off a backup quickly and easily.It seems to do exactly what a backup program SHOULD do! And what most other backup programs do not at all seem capable of doing!-------------Edit 5/2012: I notice that this product is no longer available. I happened to be looking at my Amazon reviews, and noticed that I had done this review many years ago. Unfortunately, I did this review very shortly after getting the product. My subsequent experience with this product was that it was extremely unreliable and difficult to use, and I long ago deleted it from my system. I just wanted to edit my old review so that if anyone DID come across this product, I recommend NOT GETTING IT!

I have tried to watch this film twice and I simply cannot get throught the whole thing all at once, though I have seen it all. For the life of me I cannot figure out what makes this movie so good, why so many people like it, and why it was voted the best movie of all time by AFI. When people talk about "Citizen Kane" They talk about how "brilliant" the filming and direction were for the time. Well that may be but to me a good movie is more than just filming and directing. I'm not sure who came first but Alfred Hitchcock filmed in the same style. The only difference is that Hitchcock's movies were interesting and entertaining! I think that's something Well's forgot about. This movie is boring and completely unentertaining. The "brilliant" film work and direction keeps you interested for about a half hour and then you're just saying to yourself "what the hell am I watching"?I would put this near the top of the worst movies of all time list not the best. I agree with a previous review that AFI should have to refund the money to all the people they got to suffer through this horrible waste of film.
Hilarious, hysterical screed about &quot;hippies&quot;, &quot;Manson&quot; and the decadent California subculture in the late sixties by a mysterious Canadian-Brit pulp author supposedly masquerading as a journalist. Wallowing in the kind of salacious, dime novel prose he so willingly condemns the press for using to create the Manson-as-icon, he takes on that annoyingly presumptuous &quot;voice of the characters&quot; style of journalism that hypnotizes mass market readers. Surprisingly, as a quickie-cash-in, the only factual errors he makes are very minor, but Manson scholars will find only silliness here and no one but pure collectors need consider it a necessary buy, unless you happen upon a 1970 1st edition of course.
I bought my platinum colored GameBoy Advance SP (GBA SP) in 2003 while in the Army. Last week, (June 2010) the Army sent me on yet another trip. Took my GBA SP on the 10 hour plane ride and had a great time! Sure, there are newer handhelds out there, but this one is pretty affordable now and there are just a TON of games availabe for this thing! The new Nintendo DS plays the GameBoy Advance games so the games for this unit are still all over the place (used) if you look around (e.g. pawn shops, eBay, etc.) Some of the newer handheld devices might appear to have "better" graphics, but really, how great do you expect the graphics to be on a screen that's only about 2 inches across--on ANY brand's handheld device? The GameBoy Advance SP is essentially a Super Nintendo (SNES) in convenient hand-held from. The display on the GBA SP is very clear and sharp and the light (which you can turn off to save batteries if you prefer to play in direct light or sunlight) makes the display as clear as any good TV. The 32-bit games for this are equal to--and in many cases better than--the games sold for the SNES. Nintendo has always been beyond the cutting edge in video games. Nintendo has always been an innovator and inventor. Nintendo has always been the company with the "original" ideas. While the competition and Nintendo itself have newer handheld game devices on the market now, you only have to spend a moment with the GameBoy Advance SP to realize that this device was way ahead of it's time and is STILL a worthwhile entertainment investment. Used devices and games are very affordable compared to the newer competition. Replacement batteries and parts for repair as also still readily available at low prices. Unless you're some silly kid who thinks that "great graphics" are what make something FUN, you'll really enjoy this device. Grab one before they become nearly impossible to find!
I thought I was getting the documentary that comes on the military channel instead I got something with an almost comical undertone. I was highly disappointed since I love the documentary the military channel shows. I didn't bother sending this back since it was only about 8 bucks but I think a distinction needs to be made between the two as I'm sure lots of people are making the mistake of purchasing this piece of crap.
I have only read first 2 chapters, and am at burn out already as this book seriously needed a proof reader simply because they say first and last names way to many times in a paragraph instead of just using first name only .Example is the name Hugo Poole is used 4 times in 1 paragraph when they are only talking about him , and is same for other characters in first 2 chapters . I am almost certain this cannot be the best of Thomas Perry .
Voici la plus grande trilogie du heavy-metal qui allait tout bouleverser dans l'&eacute;sot&eacute;risme m&eacute;tallique. Et quelles harmonies ! Il fallait s'appeler Fougeray pour ne pas percevoir la grandiosit&eacute; de ces opus en Black Sabbath majeur. C'est toujours un bonheur que d'entendre &quot;Cities on flame with r'n'r&quot;. Quant &agrave; &quot;The last days of May&quot;, si vous n'comprenez pas apr&egrave;s &agrave; qu'elle ne reviendra plus jamais, cette salope, allez vous faire pendre ailleurs !

WORDS CAN'T DESCRIBE HOW GREAT THIS CD IS. IT'S BEEN AWHILE SINCE I'VE HEARD A CD THAT I WOULD CONSIDER A MASTERPIECE, BUT THIS ONE TAKES THE PRIZE. MY FAVORITES ARE:CORNBREAD, FISH, AND COLLARD GREENS: REAL FUNKY, UPTEMPO TRACKCHARLENE: DESTINED TO BECOME A QUIET STORM CLASSICMY FIRST LOVE: IT WILL REMIND YOU OF THE FIRST PERSON YOU FELL IN LOVE WITHI RECOMMEND THIS CD FOR THE TRUE MUSIC LOVERS OUT THERE!!
I have both versions of this Microsoft wireless mouse -Winter BlueandSlate. Just in case you're wondering: they are identical except for the colors, so you might as well choose which ever one is on sale. Of course if you need two wireless mouses, then it is best to pick one of each color. This way you can ensure that when you operate both mouses in close proximity, their wireless transmitters will not interfer with each others.What I found surprising is that this wireless mouse consumes very little power when it is in low-power standby mode. When you move the mouse around, the LED light brightens up, and current cunsumption jumps to about 25mA briefly. But once you stop moving the mouse, the current soon drops to only 0.4-0.5mA. Therefore you can expect a single AA alkaline cell (typically rated at 2800mAh under light load) to last for about six months, even if your never turn the mouse off. This kind of battery life is simply amazing.If you want to use rechargeable battery in this mouse, make sure you choose the latest generation of "ready-to-use" low self-discharge cells (such asSanyo Eneloopor Rayovac Hybrid). Don't even bother with older generation 2500mAh NiMH cells from Energizer or any other brands, because those cells will completely self-discharge within a few weeks.One final remark: This mouse can be used under Windows XP without any software drivers. However, it is best to install the IntelliPoint 5.0 (or later) mouse driver from Microsoft. It gives additional customization features, plus a battery status monitor from your PC.
I like OS products, especially their weather stations, which I use. But I cannot recommend these grill thermometers. I threw both in the trash after they gave bizzare readings. Today, I was set to grill a prime rib roast....the OS probe (the one I had NOT thrown away because of the same problem) registered 199 degrees out of the refrigerator.I compared to my Maverick thermometer, bought also on Amazon. It registered the correct 52 degrees.I covet my meats done to perfection, and so far OS has not done the job. The Maverick dual senor thermometer has performed very well in my Weber grill and my Charbroil fryer. And yes, I know how to use digital, remote thermometers....lol.For my money, try the Maverick.....good performer and does not give you wacko temp readings like BOTH of my OS did.
the product works as expected. however, it looks really out of style. I do not wanna look like I am wearing a hearing device. I returned this product and replaced it with Jabra BT8040.. couldn't be happier....
The sound of this MP3 version is fantastic compared to the ones you can listen to on old time radio/youtube. Worth the price for the fullness of the voice. LOVE it and listen every christmas eve.I didn't want to use the cloud MP3 to download it..would rather have just bought a cd but alas...progress, apparently there are NO CD's of this. Worth the price. Easy to download.
This is the third greatest album to ever be released in the history of rock and roll.(Next to Ok Computer and The White Album.)If I ever stop liking Radiohead it may be because I have gone retarted or I've developed a serious illness.
I really enjoyed seeing this movie again, it's one of my favorites from when I was young. However, I don't know if it is worth the price difference to buy old movies in Blueray.
This book is very dry, but a necessary evil for a course I am taking. If they condensed the content down to the key elements and the charts, you could get by with about 1/2 the total page length.
this movie like american history x was right on the money in the start. but as always the white guilt kicks in and whitey is the evil one. so you know how its going to end. when are they going to make a movie about the evils of other hate groups, oh wait there just patted on the back for hating whitey and given money to keep expanding. thumbs down for the typical hollywood ending. why is it when the white man and woman are proud and have racial idenity they are evil and bad and must be struck down? but we constantly pat the back of those who hate the white man but love the white woman.
We were just about ready to get in the car, in good old Texas 100 degree heat (!)to do some shoe shopping for my husband. He knew exactly what he liked and wanted in the same style of sandal that he has always worn. I suddenly asked him, hey, let me try Amazon first.Not only was this pair just what he was looking for, it was even on sale. We bought this and another pair in a different style that fit the bill perfectly for what he was looking for.Workmanship is great, and they fit just fine. Now I have to go do a search for the type of tennis shoes he likes here!
Great lotion for the price, absorbs fast, no greasy feeling. I'm not in love with the scent, it is not bad, just prefer Palmer's shea butter Formula.
Mine is broken, too. Dead as a door knob. Take your chances. Used very little, Didn't have it too long.
The low speed stopped working a short while after I bought it--so it's either high speed or nothing. And then the side-to-side adjustment (if not in oscillating mode) gets stuck a lot and won't allow adjustment. This is just not a quality piece of merchandise.
Yes, this book was good in that it seemed to accurately portray the breakdown of a family when one of its members actually "breaks down".However, it is an extremely depressing book in that no one seems to get any better. Angie floats around, mostly in a paranoid state, in and out of hospitals, group homes and her own home. Luke leaves college, leaves his girlfriend, drifts around for a while, then gets back with his girlfriend and goes back home (doing what, I'm not sure - the book wasn't clear on that). Pieter keeps playing his cello and wallowing in self pity. And Jordana never fully copes or even comes to term with Angie's illness. She is also drifting.This may be reality, but it is an extremely depressing reality. I have read "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and loved it. This book is NOTHING like "Cuckoo Nest".
This book supports the propsition that simplicity is the best design. Short and simple, the author provides a good working outline of the principles underlying the law of attraction and then provides practical exercises to assist the reader in utilizing them. (Free additional downloadable forms are available from the author's website.)Like the Law of Gravity, there is not a whole lot of new material regarding the Law of Attraction. The trick is implementing the principles. Deceptively simple, the law of attraction often proves elusive. The author has done a superb job of desribing the basics and rendering them user friendly.
If you can catch this series on PBS for free it is interesting enough to watch. Otherwise, you'll regret having paid to view it. Why? Because other than the ranch house itself, which you see very little of beyond the front porch, there is nothing historical about this series.You will not see a glimpse of life in the 1800's. You will see an ungrateful, lazy, whining, group of people who not only ruined a wonderful opportunity to experience a life lost to us a long time ago, but they also spoiled it for the rest of us who looked forward to watching them live it.This was suppose to be a PBS educational show not something I would expect to see on FOX, like watching Paris Hilton working on a farm--insipidly entertaining, but certainly not educational. However, unlike the Paris Hilton, the Cooke family weren't entertaining, just annoying. They whined and complained about everything!If the Cooke's didn't want to give up the comforts of modern living or live according to the societal/cultural standards of the 1800's, they shouldn't have signed up for the show. In fact, they would have done all of us a favor if they had just stayed home. That way PBS could have possibly gotten a different family who would have embraced the 1800's ranch lifestyle instead of the Cooke who constantly reminded the viewing audience how life back then sucked. How the Cooke family got selected for the show is beyond me.Standards of PBS must be slipping if they put their stamp of approval on mess like this. Ken Burns must be in shock."Cast of Characters":Cooke family as a whole: Lazy whiners!!!!! They added nothing to the show.Mr Cooke: Completely worthless as a ranch owner or a boss; incapable of making good decisions; untrustworthy; dishonorable; unreliable; useless for physical labor; couldn't even do the non-taxing work of keeping the books; the reason why the word "henpecked" was created.Mrs Cooke: Irritating; instigator; busybody; holier than thou attitude; paranoid; selfish; truly unlikable; would rather live revoltingly among flies than clean a dish; reason why the word "shrew" was created.Cooke Children: Useless; droll; boring.Mora: She seemed to be a plant by PBS purposely put there to cause controversy.Cowboys: Immature; hard-working when they wanted to be.Nacho: Disgusting; revolting; another likely plant to cause controversy.
I've been a fan of Tata Young's album "I Believe" since the day it came out. I was anxious for another English album, and because "Dangerous Tata" is partly in English, I decided to buy it. I was happily surprised while listening. The first single "Dangerous" is instantly catchy, and is much more hip hop/R&B; than anything she's done before. There are several other great songs, as well as a stunning digipack with gorgeous glossy photos. Here's an overview of the tracks:1. Dangerous - VERY hip hop/rap. If this were in English, it would do well in America. Awesome vocals and a super catchy chorus make this one a winner. 10/102. Shinning - A slow, calm ballad. I'm not sure if I like the man singing, but Tata sounds amazing as usual. 8/103. Completely - Sounds rather like Shinning. Another ballad, but sort of bland. 6/104. Love Without a Cause - An uptempo ballad. Cute and catchy, with a nice chorus. 8/105. I'll Be Your Girl - Another R&B; influenced track. Picks up the pace after all those slow songs. The vocals blend with background music perfectly, and a rap halfway through the track adds to the essence of the song. 9/106. Give It Back to Me - A "girl power" song. Sounds powerful and emotional, Tata's strong vocals are perfect. 8/107. Love Song in the Wind - How did you know? Another ballad. This one, however, has a beautiful melody, and sounds sweet and sad. 9/108. In the Mood - Wow, another R&B; song! Reminds me of something Beyonce might sing. 9/109. Hey Ma Ma Say - Probably my favorite upbeat song on the album. Totally catchy, totally amazing. Infectious beyond words! 10/1010. Calling Inside - My favorite ballad of the album. This is the only truly gorgeous slow song on Dangerous Tata. Almost made me cry the first time I listened - and I don't even understand it! 10/10While there are some fairly average tracks here, there are also some stunning ones. If you're a Tata fan, this is worth picking up for sure, or if you just want to branch out and listen to something new. Overall Album Grade: 9/10
I have tried two different copies of this DVD. Both my PC DVD player and my RCA home DVD player presented disasterous results about 1:19:20 into the movie. The screen turned into big green blocks. I contacted MGM and they said it was a problem with compatibility between the DVD and some RCA models. Doesn't explain why my PC wouldn't run it correctly, but does explain why it was fine in a friend's Panasonic unit that I tried it in while troubleshooting. You would think that MGM online tech support would give a better answer than &quot;it doesn't work with some RCA players. Update your PC DVD drivers and use it in that player.&quot; I will keep it because it is a Bond, but am warning fellow RCA users to be wary until MGM decides to give a better answer why this is not working correctly.
I'm a huge fan of the Castlevania series. I've been playing since the days of regular nintendo. Now, with Castlevania Chronicles some a new, awesome addition to the series. Never before released in America, comes a game that every fan of the series will love. Get ready for a wild ride back to Drac's Lair.You play as Simon Belmont, on a quest to stop Drac. There are 8 levels in the game, each having 3 stages. You have a whip, and a sub weapon that you pick up, and you alone face the evil of Castlevania. What are you Waiting for?The game is good ol' sidescrolling action. The control is quick and responsive, and the action is intense. It's so much fun. The only problem with it is it's shortness. The levels go by fast, depending on how good you are at it. It's a tough game. Still, once you finnish it, you'll go back again, as the castle beckons you to.You have no excuse not to buy this game, It simply Rocks!
This is my favorite Esham cd. The beats are knockin and the flow is great. The subject matter is dark and grim, just how wicked rap use to be, before ICP got all "happy" on us. (Homies, The People, I Do This) If you've never heard of Esham I reccomend this one first, because then you'll be a fan for life fool!
This movie is freaky! Sam Neill is a insurance fraud investigator who is investigating the dissapperance of a horror book writer. That's where the normal ends, Neill is then taken to the hometown of the writer where all anything weird happens. My advice to anyone wanting to buy this movie is rent it first or borrow it from a friend because not everyone likes it, but i did. It is a good movie but its weird.
Replacing a rodent with a scorpion and putting wings on a lizard, throwing cgi monkey things, masturbater machines and a fancy fast and furious car chase into a once solid thought provoking sci fi film doesn't result in what I'd call a directors cut.The additions are on the level of pre-pubescent graffiti under a bridge, or doodles you might see on the inside of a jr high school book. They are poorly conceived hastily rendered childish outbursts, serving only to distract and cheapen the original structure.I'm actually surprised Lucas didn't cgi some mustaches and eye-patches onto some of the characters.
I studied political science in a leftist university and I read a lot of Marx texts, some of them are useful to think, to reflect, to debate and to confront ideas against non-leftis authors, but The Manifiesto is useless for this proposit.
This is a video that is very hard to find, although it should be required viewing for anyone interested in the history of Irish independence from England and Michael Collins, the charismatic leader who brought it about. It is essentially the story, told in abbreviated and somewhat telescoped style, of the Irish War of Independence and the treaty with Endland which ended it and brought Ireland its first taste of freedom in 700+ years. The main part of the story centers around the parts played by Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith (the founder of Sinn Fein)in negotiating the treaty with the lions of the British Empire, in particular David Lloyd George (the "Welsh Wizard") and Winston Churchill. Collins, who had just led the Black and Tan War and created the intelligence network and guerrilla strategy that had driven the English to the negotiating table, is played to perfection by Brendon Gleeson (who should have been tapped to play the same role in Neil Jordan's "Michael Collins"--no slight intended to Liam Neeson)while all the other parts are extremely well done by a wonderful cast of predominately Irish actors, with a particular nod to Ian Bannon as the crafty Lloyd George. The depiction of the intrigues engaged in during the negotiations, the interest taken in the dashing Collins by English/Irish society hostess Hazel Lavery, the backdoor dealings on all sides and the back-stabbing done by Irish Republican president Eamon DeValera and his supporters back home in Ireland are all engrossing and eye-opening. The transformation of Collins from an alleged "gunman" into a statesman is one of the most fascinating parts of the story, as is the grudging admiration with which he comes to be viewed by the much more experienced British aristocrats facing him across the bargaining table. It is the story of a history-making break in the British Empire and the combination of nobility and deceit, power and passion of the men who were responsible for it. Highly recommended if you can get your hands on it.
I have had mine for well over a decade and use it when i need to and it is great to use at the office since im in a cubicle. I love mine and recommend it for ease of use
Great CD, beautiful tunes, men your ladies will love Disc 1, especially tracks 5,6,7 - wow! As for Disc 2, I love gospel music but an upbeat song would have made it five stars.
This is what media should be used for. Watched it with the wife and all 6 boys. Wonderful, uplifting story about change and how good can change. Just a simple, friendly boy who changes hearts and minds by being himself and brings joy to others. Just get it.
A very moving novel about an unusual Chinese tradition. Gives new understanding to the ritual of footbinding so the reader (esp Westerners) can have a new appreciation for why women bound their feet.
You need to know what you're doing to really get the most out of this device, but really, this device works fine. I own several of them and use them for my business and home.To get it to work, you need to sign up for a SIP account with a VOIP provider, like Voip.ms, Voicepulse, Vitelity, or Callcentric.I suggest updating the firmware as soon as you receive it, as there are frequent useful firmware updates.To respond to some of the one star reviews:Of course the device doesn't work with Vonage, it's not supposed to! Vonage doesn't use SIP!Of course the device died when you plugged the wrong power adapter into it - it fried the circuit board. You could make that same comment about hundreds of devices.UPDATE: While I still think this device is good, I now recommend purchasing a Linksys SPA-2102 instead, due to a new firmware update from Linksys. It's worth the extra $[...] or $[...] bucks for the ability to tweak DTMF detection.
I've had this trackball for about 7 years and used it with my Mac. It has been great, not having to chase the mouse around the desk, lift it up and bring it back, then chase it around again. It's need for cleaning is the biggest drawback and why I gave it 4 stars. I usually use and exact-o-knife to clean the build-up on the rollers and then some kind of cleaning solution on a cotton swab, like 409). It is also starting to just get old (in my opinion) with optical-wireless ones out there. If it were wireless (Bluetooth preferred) and optical, I'd buy a new one without hesitation. I love the placement of the ball and the buttons and being able to program the buttons the way I like.
This book receives the official designation of "Pleasant Literary Surprise of 2005". All of the stories within inverted the "stalk 'em/slash 'em/stash 'em/drop 'em in Jersey" cliches quite pleasantly. Well done!
Cher is everything that is wrong with music and has been for sometime now. Thirty five years now and a slew of help along the way has given this monster a world wide reputation. If there was the least bit of talent, I'd have no reson to write this review. If you feel the need to buy played out hogwash with no talent for singing or playing any sort of instrument, waste your money here. All I can do is shake my head.
This book was recomended by my Dr. It is full of very helpful info.
I remember hearing the song "Dirty Weapons" on some metal compilation and I just thought, what a great song. I had to check out more of the Killer Dwarfs. I remember seeing a video on MTV years and years ago where I think his name is Russ is in box being bounced around town. I can't remember the song but a very interesting video. I never saw it again. Needless to say label support was lacking with this band. That is why they didn't get the video rotation or airplay back then. Evidence is this here album or should I say CD. The material on this is strong rock and even contains a power ballad, "Doesn't Mattter", a prerequisite in the 80's hair band days. The band liked it so much they released it again on the "Method To The Madness" CD, the era from where this recording hails. Anyway let's get to the music.1. Dirty Weapons 10/10. Just fantastic2. Nothin' Gets Nothin' 9/10 Great riffs3. All That We Dream 9/10 Great beat4. Doesn't Matter 8/10 I am not a huge power ballad fan but a good song nonetheless.5. Last Laugh 8/10 a good rocker6. Comin' Through 10/10 Another of the big songs from this release.7. One Way Out 9/10 very good song that keeps the momentum up8. Appeal 7/10 one of the weaker songs9. Not Foolin' 9/10 more great riffs10. Want It Bad 9/10 great closerMost if not all of these songs have catchy chorus and just meaty guitar riffs. Very underrated album from the 80's. but wait. There is more. 5 BONUS TRACKS from the "Method To The Madness" CD. Not nearly as good of an album but the 2 best tunes are included here in "Method To The Madness" & "Cowboys And Conmen". The other 3 tracks are competent enough but "Dirty Weapons" the CD was still their best release. Check it out and see if you don't agree with me. The Bonus tracks just help make this an even better CD. Recommended for all fans of 80's metal.
This movie is a classic for anyone who grew up in the 80's. It is hard not to love.
There isn't much more for me to say about this book that hasn't already been discussed, but I'll add this:If you're serious about the future of your African American sons, brothers and male counterparts, you'll do well to read this book as it has VERY REAL examples that support its title.There are, however, two issues I have with this book.#1. It appears that the author has a prejudice against rap music, but later changes it to gangster rap. Let me just state that rap music does not cause black boys to be violent or become drop-outs as the many white boys who also listen to it continue to excel at school and avoid prison. Gangster rap, on the other hand, is another story as it feeds negative emotions and becomes subliminal with constant listening.#2. The author is fixated on his Christian religion. He implies that belief in God is somehow a necessary component in solving the problem. This is rather disappointing, because if the author hopes to convey his message to the entire black community, he needs to take other people's beliefs into consideration when offering his solutions. Not everyone believes in God, not everyone believes in your God and no God has been proven to be real.In any case, these two issues did not prevent me from finishing or enjoying this book. Hopefully, many others possess the same open-mindedness that I have.[EDIT: this review had the wrong rating. I've updated it.]
I don't know what's been getting into rap the last several years...but it's awful. I liked it back in the 1980s, but the Gangsta rap started turning me off to it in the 1990s (though Snoop Dog was alright), and now it's plain awful. There's no message, no attempt at keeping a note (except for women artists), no nothing. And this artist is the worst of the current newbies.I doubt he'll be popular still in 2006...better chance of Vanilla Ice/ Robert Van Winkle staging his comeback. Anyone can be angry and scream a song and repeat lyrics to formerly- popular music... luckily there's a new one every few weeks.
I bought one of these at Walmart- it was $9, how could I resist?What a piece of junk! Its easy to overfill, the bubbles drool over the edge and drip down the surface it sits on... and then 2 weeks later, it just decided to stop working.I would never buy one again. :-(
I live in San Diego and our water is extraordinarily hard. Over the course of a week, my dishes were no longer getting clean, the machine was making an awful sound and there was this white coating on the inside of the dishwasher and on the plates. The repairman came out and discovered a huge chunk of gunk was clogging my unit down where the grinder is. Turns out that the dishwasher fills up once at the beginning and then the water is sprayed out again and again. Unless you have a clog like I did and then the machine sounds like it is grinding as it tries unsuccessfully to suck the water up from the bottom and spray it out.The repairman suggested 3 things. The first was that I not use those handy little detergent packets that have Dawn in them. He said that the Dawn combines with the minerals and really gunks up the works. That makes sense as I had started using the Dawn/Cascade packets about 3 months ago. The second suggestion was that I use Dishwasher Magic. And that I take all my filmy/cloudy glasses and run them with the Dishwasher Magic. My stained coffee cups should go on the bottom shelf to remove the stains. And that instead of leaving the wax plug in place, I should remove it. His reasoning was that if you run the cycle with the plug in place, it might take until the end of the cycle for the wax plug to melt releasing the Dishwasher Magic, and then you won't have the benefit of having the citric acid run time and time again through your system. I'm guessing they put the wax plug in for safety reasons - so people don't accidentally splash themselves with the stuff.I did as he said and my glasses are beautiful, the coating is off the inside of my washer. And yeah, my dishes are clean once again!!3/13/2011I went to Target and they were out of Dishwasher Magic, but I found a product I've come to like even more, LemiShine. It's a powder that you put in the detergent cup. I have been using about a tablespoon along with a tablespoon of Cascade. My dishes are shiny and spotless every wash now. Before, I was using the Dishwasher Magic about every 2 weeks, but between times my dishes would start to get cloudy. I love this new stuff.
Lovecraft's contribution to supernatural horror in literature was not primarily as a writer-it was his creation of what is usually called "The Cthulu Mythos"-a fictional connection between the stories he wrote.He created a mythology involving creatures that might be aliens or might be demons,who are worshipped by an intensely secret, violent cult."The Call of Cthulu" takes up loose ends from happenings literally all over the world and weaves them into a rope that will eventually hang the fictional author of the story.I loaned several collections of Lovecraft's books to a friend. After he returned them, I asked "Have you noticed that there is no dialogue in any of these stories?" The answer was no.Lovecrafts' dialogue,when it appears,is awful. The pep talk that the hero in "The Dunwich Horror" gives his men is ludicrous.But his power as a storyteller and the amazing mythology he develops are so powerful that the reader simply doesn't notice that none of the charecors ever say anything. One of his best works is an essay on horror fiction called "Supernatural Horror in Literature." Anyone interested in fiction-any kind of fiction-should read this brilliant essay. Lovecraft was a deeply troubled man, a racist,usually broke, and a writer who was simply incapable of writing believable dialogue. He was also a towering figure who's ability to leap from writing horror stories to creating a completely convincing cult based on supernatural creatures stranded on earth remains breathtaking. A complicated man who demands study
Interesting, but predictable, story. Tarzan is presented a bit wilder than in the movies. Once again, Burroughs' imagination isamazing.
Everybody knows that the original Psycho is superior to the sequels, and definitely that awful 1998 remake with Anne Heche (Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates? What the hell is that?), but these sequels are still pretty good. I think my favorite is the second, then the fourth, and then the third. Altogether, for about five dollars, this is an awesome deal!Psycho II (1983)- This film opens with the quintessential shower scene, seguing into the opening credits with the Bates Motel sign turning from black and white into color. The film opens well, and I'm glad to see Vera Miles as the only person from the original still in the film, other than Anthony Perkins, of course. It also has Meg Tilly in it as the daughter of Lila Loomis (Vera Miles), and she falls in love with Norman. The film, of course has some killing sequences, and some good suspense leads unto the pretty brilliant ending. This movie is nothing compared to the original, but it's still a good film.Psycho III (1986)- I think out of the three Psycho sequels and prequels, this is the worst, but it's still not bad. The thing that's interesting about this film is that it's directed by Anthony Perkins himself. It begins with a very Vertigo-like scene, (takes place in a bell tower), which was I guess what they were trying to pull off. After that, it starts to take off. There are different things in this film that were recreated for this film (the staircase killing, that devilish smile to the camera at the end of the film), but one thing I had to say was, when a certain character dies and falls down the staircase, similar to the killing of Martin Balsam in the original "Psycho", I just laughed. It was such a horrible recreation and it looked so stupid, but altogether I'd say the film was intense and pretty good.Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990)- The last Psycho film in the series, and this one was made for TV, and I liked it. It has CCH Pounder as a radio host, and this one goes back to the 50s, during Norman's childhood. It's really interesting and has a nice ending altogether, but there's just so many things that don't fit...If you haven't seen these movies and don't want me to spoil it don't look ahead...In the original Psycho movie, of course Norman killed his mother and her boyfriend, and in the 2nd Psycho film, we get introduced to Emma Spool, Norman's real mother, and he kills her, but in the 3rd Psycho, we find out Emma Spool killed Norman's mother because she wanted her husband way back then, and in the 4th Psycho, suddenly it goes back to Norman's childhood and he clearly kills his mother and the boyfriend. How could have Emma Spool kill the mother if Norman did? And also, in the 4th Psycho, it shows that it dates back to 1954, but in the original Psycho, the sheriff said that his mother was "dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetary for 10 years", but that was only a six-year gap (1954-1960), which is surprising because the writer of the original Psycho (Joseph Stefano) wrote Psycho IV. It's surprising that he doesn't know that. But once you get past all that nit-picking, these sequels are pretty good. They're probably all 4 out of 5 stars.If you want to see the Psycho sequels, I suggest you get this Universal Triple Feature, which comes with all the movies for a cheap price. It doesn't come with any special features (just the theatrical trailers), but it's an amazing deal
Ideal for dry cleaning, canvass bag is convenient for the car, and quickly detaches. The second I will use for white washables and store color washables in my front load washer. Definitely not family size, but ideal for singles or couples, or as I typed, for dry cleaning.My laundry room is multifunctional w/ granite flooring, so something stylish was a must.Down side is that the screw covers do not even remotely match the nice color of the wood and do not fit snug. Obviously they will soon get lost.
Small town (Idaho) girl makes good by 'bullying' her way into a burlesque show owned and run by far more seasoned performer (Cher). Might sound a little lame, but what a fun movie!! You can absolutely forgive anything about the script because the performances are OUTSTANDING!! Most definitely a feel good movie with heart and humor. Oh and did I mention CHER was amazing, as always. This woman belongs in front of a camera. Excellent performances by all. Bravo and thank you! I bought it the minute my rental ended.
i own quite few 18v lithium ion makita tools and this grinder is one that i really appreciate. after reading other reviews, i wonder who would buy this with expectations of it performing on the same level as a corded model? i do a lot of interior steel stud framing and i use this grinder to cut the heads off of concrete anchors and to notch light gauge steel. this cordless grinder is GREAT for that and has a lot more torque than i expected. keep in mind that i understand tools and i know that having cordless convenience means some trade offs. it will stall out if i get stupid with it...but i use it for convenience and i know to take lighter cuts with it and to go slower than i would with a big corded unit. this thing is impressive and it will do a lot. i used it to sharpen lawn mower blades and it was great for that. i can also use it to cut thru chain links and small bolts and items that are away from electricity and would be difficult to run an extension cord to. it's a grat tool that can do a lot if you take your time and go slow on bigger tasks.
Had it out of the box and working in about half an hour. I did hit one little snag that required a call to the D-Link tech support center, and I was DELIGHTED to hear an American voice... no off-shore outsourcing for these guys! With their help I had the problem quickly solved.I'm not overly thrilled with the signal strength, but at least I can connect from anywhere in the house. I've heard other people voice the same complaint.NOTE: With this and any other wireless router, make sure you ENCRYPT YOUR CONNECTION. If not, anyone can drive by your house and login to your network.Enjoy!
We've had slugs in the flower bed for years, but they didn't like the flowers I grew, so we lived in semi-harmony. This year, though, I decided to have a small backyard veggie garden in the flower beds, in containers, and on 6 straw bales. That's when the troubles began. Slugs mowed down my peppers, cantaloupes, cucumbers, marigolds, peas, beans, and okra. I started off using remedies I found online, including sawdust, coffee, sand, beer, and diatomaceous earth. I only slowed them down a little, but when I added the Sluggo, the tide turned.Now I sprinkle Sluggo around all the veggie plants, and I put out dishes of beer overnight in the shaded areas (where I think they're hiding), and I sprinkled the shaded area with sawdust. I had to replant almost everything, but it's all looking good now. You have to use a lot of Sluggo, and in places that need to be hoed, of course you have to re-sprinkle, so it's going to be expensive, but I'm winning the war against the slimy, slithering slugs.
I've had to restart this game three times because for some reason the game wants to save to a memory card instead of the hard drive The people who ported this one from PS2 didn't thoroughly Q&amp;A this critical feature. Don't eject the disk or you will lose a days worth of playing!Dialogue and cut scenes take up much valuable game time and are pretty obnoxious if you are restarting the game from the beginning.The punch kick combat is very primitive as are the car and jet controls. There is a game called Oni by Bungie that has breathtaking grappling and kung fu moves and it predates this one by at least a year.Rather than being a real game this is more like a narrative of the T.V. cartoon and you get to play a bit here and there. I'm not alone on this please read reviews under other game platforms. One person hits on what I'm trying to say by comparing it to Dragons Lair or Space Ace.Or perhaps we could be looking at a new form of interactive cartoon/gaming hybrid? If so it should cost half the price of a real game!!
Review by Mike Watson:On their much anticipated follow up to the Deathwish Records release A Great Artist, A Life Once Lost do absolutely everything, but disappoint. Graduating to the larger arena of Ferret Records, A Life Once Lost have stepped it up a few notches with their latest effort Hunter.Hunter is a completely appropriate title for this record with as relentless, violent, and absolutely vicious nature. Listening to the album can basically be summed up as listening to their previous album, while being tracked down and attacked by a rabid wolf. This album is by far the most destructive and malicious metalcore album to come out so far this year. Hunter showcases A Life Once Lost in their prime. Pick up this album immediately, but be ready to bare your teeth.
A great definitive album for a seminal emo/rock band. These guys are great with musical texture and guitar arrangements. One of their downfalls is the occasional sleepiness they feel inclined to interject on their albums. There's nothing inherently wrong with pop songs or digressing a bit here and there from good ol' rock. It's just that the quieter moments don't hold my interest very much.But these moments of filler don't really bring the album down. "Lucky Denver Mint" is instantly catchy and memorable. "Believe In What You Want" showcases the band's talent for creating an engaging, anthemic melody while making it even more captivating with great harmonies. "Blister" and "Clarity" are good examples of how the band can really show their teeth by pounding on their guitars and fraying their vocal cords. It's clear that this album was a less reigned-in mile marker on the evolutionary path to their breakout, and in my opinion, superior, "Bleed American" album.When all is said and done, my main contention with "Clarity," really, is that "Goodbye, Sky Harbor" is not nearly long enough. I think I need another 25 minutes of redundant guitar arpeggios and weepy organ, and I'd be satisfied.
This video would fall into a two or three star category were it not for the amazing vocal technique of Juan Diego Florez. Somehow, this singer who was always great, is even better than ever. He seems to be giving even more attention to delivering a variety of vocal color, which makes his somewhat bleating-style voice ever so appealing. He's just wonderful.The production is by turns tasteful and lovely, and then crass and embarrassing. Some crassness might be understood for the era they are using as a setting and the idea they are trying to underscore of 'old' versus 'new' (and young), but it's taken way too far. The Andy Warhol-style portrait of Florez is just frightening. Besides, does Norina really get the house completely redecorated in one day? It doesn't work, and Pasquale's teddy bears are embarrassing. The story is on the edge of believable as it is, so it needs to be delivered with care so as not to become foolish.I enjoyed Raimondi very much - it's a beautiful voice as always although a little lighter than one might wish for. I differ from some of the other reviewers in that I found him reasonably funny. Oliver Widmer is a good singer, although again the director annoyingly has him groping at his own sister for much of the show. He's a DOCTOR, for goodness' sake. How could he have a medical career and be that creepy? Anyway, the big duet between the doctor and Pasquale seems to absolutely thrill the audience and it was a highlight of the show. Widmer's voice is neither beautiful, nor ugly - more like pleasant, and somewhat interesting. Isabel Rey is an enjoyable singer but I would prefer a more bell-toned soprano for Norina. Rey has a darkness to her middle register, plus her high notes are not as easy as one would like. I would prefer to hear her in other operas.*****PLEASE NOTICE THE FOLLOWING*****The sound is not at all ideal on the video. On my plain old 2-channel stereo system, the orchestra is too far to the front, and the singers are in a cave. I tried both sound tracks and it was the same. However, when I played it on my computer with again only 2-channel available, but software to touch up the sound, basically by taking out the ambience, it was much better. I was going to give the video three stars until I heard it on my pc. Still, four stars is a bit of a stretch, and they really all go to Florez. Please consider this before purchasing. If I had only to go on my first experience of hearing this video, I would not recommend it as worth the money due to the sound quality, but if you have a system where you can tinker with the sound quality and environment, you should be okay.It's rarely worth it to buy an opera video for just one singer, but in this case, unless they give us another Pasquale with Florez in it, if you have any appreciation of this tenor, you might just want to buy this one.If you are trying to decide between this one and the one with Corbelli in the title role, I can only remind you that that one has a very fine tenor in it also, Eva Mei is everything a Norina should be, plus the production is sweet and tasteful. For your first Pasquale video, the Corbelli one is the best choice, IMHO.
I got this because I love Designing Women, but I was disappointed.This book is poorly written. A lot of the sentences are tortured and long winded, with lots of extra adjectives and adverbs, etc.The other problem I had is that there was very little about designing women and its making. Major parts are about her childhood, etc. which was of no interest to me. Much of the book are her opinions on things that are of little importance, and her ideas on everything are very old fashioned. My guess is that the only women who will like this book are in the 65 plus range.The one part of the book I liked was that she copped to having 2 facial cosmetic surgeries to be on Designing Women.You would do better to just talk to any older woman over 60 and ask what her childhood was like, and save your money on this book.If you are interested in Designing Women stuff, the Delta Burke book has more info on that.
I paid $15 for a similar spreader at Williams Sonoma. I needed more, but WS did not carry them anymore so I found these on Amazon.Not as "high quality" but very functional and certainly worth the price - especially since you get 4!Worth the price and a great value.
This book is horrible. It's barely even readable. Nearly every paragraph is packed with tiresome analogies that go on forever and could only make sense to the person writing them.Then there's the story. Lost in all his cumbersome, descript, superfluous writing is this little story that goes absolutely nowhere. And the ending--I forced myself through 350 pages for that? Give me a break.Unadulterated crap.
Great measuring cup set because of the value, the numbers are easy to read and it is nice to have three sizes in a set. I used them every day for over a year because I love to cook.Things were great until one of them exploded in my dishwasher. I used it in the microwave to boil water in so I could dissolve bullion for a recipe. I rinsed the cup with tepid water and put it in the dishwasher because I clean as I go. Then I continued cooking and about 5 minutes after placing the measuring cup in the dishwasher I heard a loud popping sound. I opened the dishwasher and the Pyrex cup had shattered in the dishwasher into a lot of pieces including some very tiny slivers.I consider myself blessed that it did not shatter while I was holding it, while it was full of hot liquid or when my kids were nearby. Someone could have gotten badly hurt if the shards had gotten into their skin or eyes - luckily all I lost was a couple of dishes and some time vacuuming out my dishwasher.I found out that if Pyrex is cracked or scratched and sometimes the cracks are too tiny to see it can shatter after sudden temperature changes (terminal downshock). I was very careful with my measuring cups stored them up high away from the kids and they did not have any visible chips or scratches. I think mine exploded because I was using it in the microwave where it got very hot and rinsing it in cooler water. There were no instructions or warnings about this on the product when I purchased it.It is a shame because I really loved using these measuring cups.CBS Channel 2 News Chicago did a story on exploding Pyrex you can view it here -[...]
This is advertised as a tri-ply pot -- but what I just received was an ordinary steel pot with an aluminum disk brazed to the bottom. In fact, the pot I was sent looks nothing like the one pictured: the shape is different, the lip is different, the pot is different.$99 is not a bad price for a tri-ply stock pot, but one can buy a disk-bottom pot of similar quality just about anywhere for half this price. I'd have to say this was a complete rip-off.
If this is the death rattle of the Trek franchise, then it deserves to be mourned, because Mr. Frakes pulled something rather special out of his hat with this one. From the moment the truly beautiful score starts up, this film is polished, exciting, engrossing, and slick.Special effects are a tad patchy, but at their best rival anything short of 'The Matrix', with CGI finally pulling Trek into blockbuster realm. Acting is solid, and is raised to extraordinary heights during one scene between Picard and Lily in the Captain's Ready Room, which is simply superlative drama. It may be the best scripted- and acted- scene in Trek.So the humour falls a little flat at times, and the normal Trek mantra of thoughtfulness and caring-sharing gets pushed to the rear. So what? This is a stylish, smooth addition to a legendary genre, and is the 90s equivalent of The Wrath of Khan. If only they could have kept it up . . .
This curling iron will pull your hair and break it. This product should not be in the market. It is bad constructed and overprice. Do not buy it. Not worth your hard earned money.
this is by far wild strawberries most experimental album. this is also their best album. theres just something about roberta carter's voice, possibly the accent, that lulls u in and keeps u wanting more. the mixes on this album are faster and more exciting than previous or later albums. as well the lyrics are more intellegent, but with carter's voice she can sing excerpts out of the dictionary and still make it a radio friendly song.
Love this concept, but the cartridges are kinda pricey. I refill them usingRID-X Liquid Septic Tank Additive, 48 Fluid Ounce. Works just as we'll as the original liquid, but about half the price.Thanks for reading. I hope this review was helpful!
I just bought my D490 so I can take pictures and send them to my parents and friends. This was definately money well spent. The camera is user friendly, just point &amp; shoot. It has a great zoom and it's very light. I love it and highly recommend it.
This is a most interesting and riveting series. We were always looking forward to the next chapter so we ended up watching the whole series in one long sitting. Good entertainment!!!
It is a great idea - stopper and pourer in the same device. And it is reasonably priced, works really well for a short time but does not last very long. The seal between the pourer and the wine bottle startes leaking after about a month. I also wish the stopper was tethered to the pourer by a nylon string so that it cannot get lost. It will be a good product for wine drinkers if they can make the seal with the wine bottle durable.
This biography is one the best books I've read in a long time. I think it will be the definative biography on the imcomparable Lombardi, whose brilliance as a gridiron pedagogue, whose complexity and contradictions, are all well delineated in wonderfully written and researched book. This book would make a great present for any persons interested in football history or a life of a passionate, hard working American.
I use this at work where a full-service kitchen is not available, and this is great. I can set it down in its holder if I'm too busy at the moment and unable to deal with cleaning it. It's easy to clean too. It doesn't allow much to get through the holes, and it infuses great. I read other reviews where people complained of it floating--it does float a bit, but tapping it to the bottom of your mug gets enough air out to allow it to sink. It doesn't bother me one bit. Form and function work wonders here!
Homeopathy is thoroughly discredited (seeTrick or Treatment? : Alternative Medicine on Trial,Bad Science,Voodoo Science: The Road from Foolishness to Fraudand other sources).It is particularly concerning to see it sold for use on children. There are documented cases where children have suffered long term harm and some parents have even been jailed for causing the deaths of children through relying on homeopathy instead of medicine.There is no reason to suppose this product should work, no credible means by which it can work, and no good evidence it does work beyond the placebo (i.e. fake treatment) effect. It works the same as a fake treatment for the simple and obvious reason that it is a fake treatment.
I've been using Quicken and Turbotax for almost a decade now but their behavior is getting progressively worse. First there was the Turbotax fiasco with spyware and malware being installed. Now Quicken is "sunsetting" each version three years after it is installed. Check me out if you don't believe me - the URL is http://www.intuit.com/support/quicken/sunset/. This is beyond egregious. I urge you to consider alternatives: Microsoft Money, Gnucash for linux users, Moneydance.
I didn't mind the first book of the series too much, I thought it was mildly entertaining and the characters were just like the "ultimate PC" in any Dark Sun setting, but that was about all it had.I made my way through the first 1/4 of the book and the writing style remained the same as The Verdant Passage. Still too wordy and self-indulgent and the characters were still pretty stiff and hollow and the flow of the plot was still jerky and fueled by battles.Nothing captured my attention in this book, so I gave up. I moved on to the Dragon Prince series by Melanie Rawn, a story- and character-driven series.If you like long written battle scenes and don't mind stereotypical super-characters, I would recommend this series. Or if you just want to read a tounge-in-cheek unwitting parody of RPG players.
Sound through the speakerphone varies based on how loud an automated attendant is. At first, I thought this was due to poor quality in the phone. The microphone hears really well. I like the handset for the AT&T; 210 Trimline better, but this is a good phone.5/16/11 Picked it up today, has a dial-tone in both handset and speakerphone, but won't dial out (touch tone or pulse). Only lasted 4.4 years. Disappointed.
I just finished with this epic work. After reading this history, one acquires a sense of what was going on in the minds of the leaders, and a taste of the combat. There are obviously a number of works detailing specifics of different theatres of the war and battles and fighting men and women. This book is not for you if you want details of the fighting. Rather, it elaborates the thinking behind the strategies employed, and you go away with a sense of the whole picture from a political view, and it helps explain the times before, during, and after the war that took 60 million lives. Sometimes it seems a bit callous to merely mention the toll in suffering as a statistic of the number dead in each operation, but that is not what this book centers on. It is a good account of the leaders of ALL the countries affected, and a good education. A bit dry at times, one is rewarded by insights not previously available. It might have been improved by some photographs, since it IS over 900 pages not counting the notes.Ron GiuntiniSan Francisco.
These are so much nicer than the thin hooks. The supporting peg helps hold them in place so they don't fall out every time you pull a tool off them. I use the thin wire loop to hold pliers and that one does not hold well and usually falls out each time I remove the pliers.Dr. Z
This could have been a great book because there is a serious danger from right-wing authoritarianism, particularly from the neo-conservative and Christian right. However, Dean's uncritical acceptance of "authoritarianism" as applying only to the political right, his rhetorical overkill bordering on character assassination, and his heavy polemical style render it far less helpful than it might have been. My first impression upon reading it was that it excels in ad hominem -- an impression that I predict many others will share.He notes that the term "authoritarian" is used in an idiosyncratic way by political and social psychologists and not as the ordinary political scientist or journalist would, as indeed is the case. In fact, the paradigm is constructed in such a way as to exclude extremists of the far left. Used this way, present-day political conservatives are given a bad name while Marxists, radical feminists, anti-racist extremists, Animal Liberation Fronters and ecoterrorists are spared because their extremism isn't "authoritarian."In responsible hands political authoritarianism is a very useful, if limited, concept in understanding extreme ideological movements and personalities, but when used as an epithet to tar and defame political opponents, it becomes counterproductive, somewhat like calling someone a "pervert" or a "subversive." I really wish he had exercised more restraint in this regard. In spite of this, it remains a worthwhile read.Laird Wilcox, co-author (with John George), Nazis, Communists, Klansmen and Others On The Fringe (1992, Prometheus)and Founder of the Wilcox Collection on Contemporary Political Movements, University of Kansas Library.
If there's anyone who's a big fan of horror, I'm sure they know "The Blair Witch Project". For someone who is a fan of the horror genre (me), this movie is a guilty pleasure. Now the "found-footage" genre is getting worn out (although I love it), but "Blair Witch" is original and is one of the most innovative movies of all time. The first time I saw it, I wasn't really scared, but when it was nighttime I was kinda creeped out. To truly be creeped out or scared by this movie, you have to place yourself in the character's shoes, you can't just sit back and watch the movie expecting to be scared. You have to kind of work your head around it all. You might watch the first 2 nights and think "That's not scary", but just pretend you're actually out there hearing footsteps in the woods at nighttime from 15-20 feet away. It's pretty creepy. There's a lot of the film that contains them fighting a lot, and yelling at each other, but it's also sad to watch all that happens to them. If you're bored during the first couple nights, Night 5 is when it's really thrilling, because outside of their tent they hear children laughing and a baby crying. A short moment afterwars, there's a violent pounding on the tent so they run out of it screaming. That's one of my favorite parts. Another one is, obviously, the apology scene (You see it on the cover on the bottom when it shows half her face). I think that's an emotional and disturbing scene from the movie. It's another one of my favorites, and it should have won an Oscar, but instead it won a Razzie. My third favorite part from the film was the ending. It's very freaky and you'll be thinking about it hours after you see it, but there's foreshadowing in the beginning that happens in the ending, so to get the end, you have to see the beginning. Another good scene is when they see all the stick figures. This film is brilliantly executed and it's one of my favorite horror movies of all time.
...To readers familiar with Ellis's R.E.T.(Rational Emotive Therapy)theory(also called REBT), this is already a familiar book, a variation on themes Ellis expounds upon elsewhere, most notably in "A Guide to Rational Living", written back in the 60's, where he lays out the basics of his theory. Readers unfamiliar with Ellis and R.E.T. might see his approach as similiar to television's "Dr Phil"(McGraw), and if you see the latter as something of a scold, you're likely to experience Ellis the same way.Ellis's approach emphasizes "self-talk", and asking you to question your motives in avoiding anxiety-provoking tasks. He prefers behavior-oriented and pragmatic thinking over "what-happened-way-back-when" depth psychology. If such an approach strikes you as what you're looking for in a book about this topic, then I'd recommend Ellis. He's very straightforward and easy to comprehend.
This is, without a doubt, the most boring movie I have ever sat through. I may have liked it better if the movie was 2 to 2 1/2 hours I think I would like it better. But WHO WANTS TO WATCH A 3 AND A HALF HOUR MOVIE!!!
Despite what magazine, websites may try to tell you, this product is NOT for sensitive skin, just read the long list of ingredients on the bottle. It drives my face out like there's no tomorrow. The scent is pleasant but for the same category of cleansers, Aveda sensitive cleansing cream, in my opinion, is a much milder, better tolerated product.
I am not a huge fan of ST books, for the most part. They rarely tell me anything about the series I don't already know. This New Frontier series is a different kettle of fish. I think they're great &amp; get each one as soon as it comes out. (I've taken to buying David's other books as well, about B5, and his own stuff too._Howling Mad_ is on my too-read list.) With these he tells funny, romantic, exciting, political stories, that differ a great deal from OS or TNG type ships. Mackenzie Calhoun is a different man than the Starfleet captains we've seen. His universe, his ship, is more fun too. But as much as possible these books should be read in order. I eagerly await #9 and all the other NF books to come. (Don't forget the Captain's Table book about Calhoun also by David, _Once Burned,_ you NF fans.)
I loved Hostel and Hostel 2, this doesn't hold a candle to either, if it wasn't called Hostel you wouldn't even know it was part of the same series. I don't think any one involved with the first 2 was involved in the production of this drivel. The whole thing takes place in one room with an audience watching and paying for different kinds of tortures to be performed on the victims, there's practically no story line or character development, it looks like it was shot with a digital camcorder, some of the gore is ok, but this doesn't have any replay value for me, it's a shame what happens to horror sequels when they hit unlucky #3 almost every time.
This book has a great premise -- a woman attempting to live as a man, to gain access to the "secret lives" of men. This could have been a very successful magazine article. As a full-length book, though, it's awash in pseudo-insights that range from maudlin to downright offensive. The author comes up with nothing anybody with half a brain didn't already know: "masculinity" is just as much of a potentially crippling construct as "femininity" is. Big surprise.The author seems to try hard to empathize with men, but after reading the chapter about the bowling league, I came away with a nagging sense of the author wanting to come out and say, "These poor men. The poor dumb brutes. They just can't help it!" The rest of the book wasn't much better -- in fact it was worse. Especially the chapter about visiting strip clubs, which was so cliched as to be repulsive.And why on earth would someone in the author's situation -- attempting to do research -- join an Iron John men's group? Or a monastery? That's fringe stuff, and unlikely to give the author a true cross-section of "typical" masculine behavior. Even the jobs the author takes on as a man aren't typical jobs.The women the author dated while she was posing as a man made me embarrassed to be a woman. I do know women who are like that, but I have to say, they are NOT representative of my experience or of my self.Probably most telling of all is the delight the author seems to take in the big reveal: "Guess what? I'm really a woman!" I find it amazing that nobody she deceived was hurt to the core. How lucky for the author!This book is the worst kind of self-serving, quasi-intellectual stuff. I wouldn't call it feminist. I wouldn't even call it humanist. The whole human race looks pretty irredemably messed up after viewing it through this author's eyes.
In my view, this "Meistersinger", along with Sir Georg's "Parsifal" and "Lohengrin", represents his greatest recorded Wagner. It has the advantage over the Kubelik and Karajan, also very fine versions, of a splendid digital recording - and where Decca is concerned that really means splendid. One tends to take for granted the richness and stunning accuracy of the Chicago Orchestra but one also notes that they evolved over the years, producing a warmer and more blended sound. The chorus was specially prepared by Terry Edwards, the Covent Garden chorus master. One would never think for a second that all the members are amateurs. The only singer I find slightly unconvincing is Karita Mattila as Eva. She complained after the sessions that Solti had wanted too many nuances (he approached the work as a "conversation piece", bringing out the intimacy of many scenes) when all she wanted was "a good sing", which is exactly what she gives us and doesn't sound much like an innocent young girl. Fortunately, the other singers took note of Solti's long experience of Wagner, notably Jos&eacute; van Dam, who gives much importance to the shading and meaning of the words. Some critics claimed his voice was "past its best", seemingly forgetting that Hans Sachs is supposed to be an elderly man. There is no finer Walter on disc than Ben Heppner, a gloriously rich, ringing voice. One particularly notices Solti's lyrical approach in Act 3 with the entry of the guilds: here his performance is more joyous and uplifting than Karajan's, though no-one would be disappointed with that version or with Kubelik's. If forced to choose, I would opt for Solti.
This is a great tapes. I bought another package because of the quality.
I bought some of this locally (same price as Amazon, but without the wait for shipping) after my blood tests came back showing I was low on iron.I am taking 10 ml. 2x per day. I either mix it with OJ (Vitamin C helps your body absorb iron more easily) or I take it by itself and follow it up with a small glass of OJ separately. I was prepared for the worst - many reviews complain about the taste. I don't find the taste to be bad at all. It tastes like very sweet black licorice. I was really worried I wouldn't be able to drink it, but it's not unpleasant for me.Within 3 full days of taking Floradix, I can feel the difference. I've got a 21 month old and an almost 4 year old and I don't get enough sleep. Most days, I drag thru my afternoon. Not anymore. I feel more awake and alert. I can't imagine how good I'd feel if I was also getting a solid night's sleep.Before I tried the liquid Floradix I'd tried Slow Fe pills but they made my stomach hurt and made me nauseous. The Floradix does bother my stomach a bit, but not nearly as much as the pills. It also makes my gallblladder cranky, so fair warning - if your gallbladder is a mess (like mine is), it may irritate it even more.My only real complaint with this product is the cap. I think mine might be defective because it will seem like it's screwed on tightly, but I go to shake it before use and it leaks. I've had a lot of hassles trying to get the lid off and on. After half the bottle spilled on my kitchen counter I called FloraHealth to let them know. The woman on the phone said they get a lot of complaints about the lid and leaking, but offered nothing for the fact I lost $20 worth of product due to the lid. She recommended cutting the red plastic part off of the metal lid (which I did and it works).1 star for customer service. 5 stars for the product itself.
I really love to listen to John McDermott, but didn't care for a few of the songs he picked.
This is rushed, out of balance, and um... how shall I put it... well, nicht zusammen, believe it or not. Winds slightly out of tune now and then. This video is from 1977, so the sound is defective as well: trebly and tinny. I'd live with it if the performance were good, but it's quite lousy, actually. The worst performance of both pieces I've ever heard. Give it a pass -- or, if you must hear it, rent before buying: I bet you'll forego the purchase. (PS. Ignore the five-star reviewers here: I suspect at least some of them are hired drones retyping liner notes to attach something to their contractually obligatory five stars.)
Wow this game is awesome! I've tried guilty gear, king of fighter series, mortal kombat, dragon ball supersonic warrios, gundam seed. This is the best fighting game for gba along with street fighter alpha 3 and kofhb. Characters look huge and the backgrounds are nice. Great job Capcom!Overall a great game.
En 1996, Daho a quinze ans de carri&egrave;re et il a connu l'hyst&eacute;rie du tr&egrave;s grand succ&egrave;s une dizaine d'ann&eacute;es auparavant. &Agrave; quarante ans il abandonne ses interrogations un peu simplettes du genre le chanteur de vari&eacute;t&eacute;s qui veut faire rockeur branchouille et sort un excellent album, &Eacute;den ou &Eacute;denDaho (il a toujours aim&eacute; ce genre de calembours pas tr&egrave;s fins mais l&agrave; il faut avouer que c'est plus r&eacute;ussi que le titre du pr&eacute;c&eacute;dent album R&eacute;s&eacute;rection). On a envie de dire qu'il sort enfin un excellent album et que ce n'est pas trop tt. Rien ne d&eacute;pare la r&eacute;alisation artistique, les textes sont enfin &agrave; la hauteur, la musique ne fait plus orgue Bontempi, il se d&eacute;tend un peu et va mme jusqu'&agrave; se souvenir d'I feel love de Donna Summer dans Rendez-vous au jardin des plaisirs. Enfin, il chante Les bords de Seine avec la reine de la bossa-nova, Astrud Gilberto, The girl from Ipanema en personne. Comme quoi, il ne fallait pas d&eacute;sesp&eacute;rer...
I went to RPI and took a course that centered around this book, and one of the authors of this book happened to be teaching the course. The professor was absolutely terrible, so I tried to rely on this book... but that wasn't exactly possible. The book is just plain useless.First, the book doesn't really actually have examples, it has a bunch of problems that leave the process and answer as an "exercise for the reader". I can't begin to describe how frustrating that is... when your professor refuses to teach a concept, and your textbook expects you to magically come up with it on your own. The problems at the end of each chapter are often completely disconnected from the chapters that they are assigned to, so reading through the chapter (or previous chapters) will not help you solve them.I've read a lot of textbooks cover to cover, and have a dual degree in Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, and I have to say that in my entire Undergraduate education journey, I have not come across a book that came even close to being as terrible as this.If you're thinking about buying this in hopes of learning some probability, DON'T. It won't help you learn anything except how to be really angry at the people who wrote it. If you're forced to buy this for a course that requires it, don't buy it with the intention of keeping it (you'll want to give it away or burn it when you're finished), and buy the Papoulis and/or Yates books so you can actually pass your class. Good luck!
I recently purchased this knife here to replace a Victorinox Super Tinker which I had lost. Interestingly I found the other knife right after ordering this one.For the price this knife is an incredible value. It is about $17 less than the Champ and the only thing it lacks that the Champ has is the pliers which you are better off using a Leatherman pliers for.For a knife that has just about everything but is still small enough to carry it has all you need. And it has the Victorinox quality. If there is any downside at all it is a bit large to carry in the pocket. If you need more than this knife has buy a toolbox. My last Swiss Army knife I had I have owned for over 12 years. I wonder how long I will be able to keep this one. If I take care of it I can pass it on to my grandchildren. If you were looking for a Christmas present with value for someone who likes this stuff this is an incredible buy. Why women don't carry these in their purse more often I don't know. I guess it's just not ladylike to carry a knife. The women I know who do use them all the time.
I purchased this scancard for my daughter's digital camera for an upcoming trip. At first we could not get this SD card to work. Thankfully, I checked it out before she left.For some reason, it needed to be formatted to the camera. For my camera it would not have been a big deal. For my daughter who had video, saved pics and other info, it was a very big deal. She lost all her stuff. When you format, everything saved goes. She was not a happy person.However, she was happy that she was able to take many many pics while on vacation and the speed was a lot better. Yet she still complains of her lost videos.Be careful which SD cards you buy, we did not have to format the last one and I am confused as to why this one needed it. I gave it 4 stars because this 2.0 is fast and makes you happy with the amount of pics that can be taken.
this is my introduction to Maria Taylor, besides the bg vocals with bright eyes.... and i don't want to turn this record off. i can just let it play and play and play.this is a record full of atmosphere, emotion (but not slushy), and fun. it is fun and melancholy all at the same time- the record contains variety, but is consistent. folk to trip-hop. just good music.enjoy. i am.::: this is for fans of portishead / beth gibbons, over the rhine, and beth orton
I have tried every lip plumper on the market (no joke) and this is the best (besides pure cinnamon leaf oil, which burns like hell). I use B.E. products and I bought a couple of these bc I liked the colors. I was not expecting it to work as well as it did. Now it is all I use on my lips! It makes your lips feel cool, not burning!
I do voluntary work with Asperger adolescents and I have yet to find any serious research in support of 'social stories'. Admittedly they are pitched at low functiong young children, but the heuristics are so general and traditional (and so widespread in visualisation therapies in general) that it is nigh on impossible to extract a testable method.This book is an example from a genre for kids with special needs that bases its 'methodology' on repackaging the obvious. To be fair a minority of parents may find that helpful, and good luck to them. But how does one distinguish between the contributions a good teacher makes to a child's improvement, and any contribution from social stories? I have no idea.A different and more research grounded approach is taken by Howlin and Baron-Cohen: Teaching children with Autism to mind read. However,it is horses for courses, and parents may prefer the 'touchy feely' hue of Social Stories. Personally I would want something stronger than anecdotal reports.
This is one of Martin Amis's funniest and most interesting books. The book/author reviews are incredibly good (you'll never read Mailer, Burroughs, Didion, with a completely straight face again), and the social commentary is very well delivered.As the title indicates, this book is highly critical of America, but it is a criticism tempered and somewhat confounded by Amis's complicated Ameriphilia: Amis's favorite writers are Americans (or at least expatriates who live in America), and Amis is very fond of claiming that he feels himself to be about half American. Yet America is the home and central breeding-ground of most of Amis's most hated evils: obscene wealth, unscrupulous capitalism (whitewashed in American euphamisms), the nuclear warfare industry, braindead religion, banal art &amp;c. In both this book and the same-period novel Money (probably Amis's best), Amis posits pornography as America's economic and cultural nexus.Amis's tense relationship with America provides for some incredibly good journalism and essays. The style throughout is outstanding, and most of my memories of the book come back in complete phrases. Looking at the early stages of the AIDS epidemic: &quot;'Spend-down' turns out to be one of those cutely hyphenated nightmares of American life. Practically stated, it means that the AIDS victim sells and spends everything before qualifying for Medicare. Duly pauperized...&quot; On Norman Mailer's The Naked and the Dead: &quot;The novel was impossibly mature. The immaturity was all to come....[later in the article] Mailer's essays from this period--'The Existential Hero,' 'The Philosophy of Hip,' and 'The White Negro'--sum up how Mailer was feeling about himself at the time.&quot; &quot;Truman Capote lived the life of an American novelist in condensed form: He was a writer at 9, a drunk at 15, a celebrity at 21, a millionaire at 35, and dead at 59.&quot; Almost the whole book is bracingly well-written.Almost: strangely, only when Amis is writing about his favorite writer (and in a few very short dud pieces), Saul Bellow, does his style seem to go dead. I suppose there's so much adoration involved (adoration which, I have to admit, I don't understand), that he's reduced to helpless quotation.
I am a fan of the Ruff Ryders and The Lox... The Lox didn't do well and they admitted it on their debut &quot;Money, Power, and Respect&quot; for Bad Boy Records.. They did the smart thing and went over to the Ruff Ryder camp where they belong... Their 2000 release &quot;We R The Streets&quot; was descent, better than their debut album though... Then the hype began for JADAKISS!. This guy was and is appearing everywhere and everyone making so much a big deal about him.. His debut solo effort Kiss Tha Game Goodbye full of 21 trax is just bad... I gave this album 2 stars because of the nice job Jada did on &quot;Put Ya Hands Up&quot; and the collabo with Nas on &quot;Show Discipline&quot;. The rest of this cd though is just horrible!. I recommend that no one picks this album up, and JADA, do us all a favor, stick with sheek and styles as the Lox, because wen it comes to SOlo, it and you don't fit..
I beg to differ with the Amazon reviewer who sang the praises of the so called engineer who mixed this CD for Kent Records. First I want to make it clear that all of the music on this CD is great, it is the music mixes for this CD that are absolutely awful. The mixes are noisy, so noisy that I can hear the gain riding hiss. Two of the songs are not even mixed at all. Song #14. "Quick Reaction', and song #17 'The Man I Love'. Song #17 is from the album 'Etta James Sings Funk' (a phonograph record that I own) on which the drums and the piano are prominent and are integral components of the musical arrangement. If this Duncan Cowell person who is supposed to be responsible for the mixing and engineering of this CD had the nerve to mix the piano and drums completely out in this manner, then he either completely forgot to mix this song or he is a novice engineer tampering with the music. Profesional engineers are not hired to rearrange the music, they are hired to electronically capture the music as accurately as possible then balance the sounds so that all of the instruments can be heard. I have a large number of Kent recordings in my collection and they are mostly first rate. This debacle is an all time low for Kent Records of England. Two stars for the music, no stars for the technician.
Inca Gold by Clive Cussler is part of the Dirk Pitt Adventure Series. This is what I view as great airplane reading. I prefer to read on long plane trips, as compared to watching the movie or sleeping. On a flight out to the coast, I can usually finish a Clive Cussler book. Sometimes it might take back and forth. On such trips, I find Dirk Pitt to be a good companion. This is basically serial adventure telling and I like this style.This particular book, as with all the Dirk Pitt books, involves a tie between theories about ancient history and modern technology. It involves amazing escapes, beautiful women, and strong, handsome, smart, resourceful men. Meaning it is easy to see myself as the hero, of course.Ok, why only 4 stars? In this book Cussler decides to teach the reader some sort of strange lesson about the metric system. As such, all measures are presented in both traditional US distances and also metric distances. After awhile, this become much more annoying than educational.
Nice picks, much brighter sounding than the jazz 3 nylon picks. I prefer the jazz 3s since thr jazz 3s are warmer sounding and wear resistant. but these pitch blacks are not bad. They do wear down quickly but a dozen should last a good amount of time. This pick does what jazz picks are suppose to do and in my university's jazz ensemble the three tips are useful and makes playing difficult jazz chord easy. It will feel awkward at first if you never used jazz picks but once you get the hang of it you'll never go back to standard picks.
I LOVE both RCT 1 and 2, but I am so sick of playing for objectives. There should be different versions because sometimes I just want to build a park. I want to build a park without financial restriction and objective restriction. There should be two modes: fun mode and tycoon mode. It would be sooo much better. I don't really care about the tycoon part. I'm just sick of building a park and then it gets shut down, and I have no guests, but I have this amazing park. Two modes would be SO MUCH BETTER!
This is a TRUE CLASSIC that has been beautifully remastered. The animations and colors are stunning. This is a MUST HAVE!
I always loved this recording way back when and I waited patiently for it to show up on cd. It is a gorgeous, creative and thrilling piece of beautiful true art. It transcended its time then and it does so now. I think if belongs in some museum of sound somewhere. It's like nothing else, and nothing like it has ever been made again. It is great!
This is the second Visual Quickstart Guide I've bought from this author, and both have been great. Probably the easiest-to-use books of their kind. I actually use this book, which is the most telling testimony I can give. Highly recommended.
UPDATE 1/29/13: I was responding to a comment on my review from 2 1/2 yrs. ago and notice that these scissors appear to have been redesigned. Hopefully they have strengthened them, especially the handle.---------------------------------------------Okay, I'll admit it, I believed the hype...the key words like TITANIUM and Lifetime Warranty had me convinced that these were durable scissors that would at the very least be long lasting. When first using them they are very impressive, very sharp, fit well in the hand, and do seem like a good quality. Keep in mind that up until I purchased these I had used nothing but basic, cheap scissors, but I will add that NONE OF THESE BASIC, CHEAP SCISSORS EVER BROKE! Yes, they may have been annoying to use, not very good at cutting anything but thin paper, and at Christmas time not able to do the neat trick of starting at the bottom of the wrapping paper and simply moving the scissors up and "slicing" instead of cutting to the top.I was so initially impressed with these "Titanium" bonded scissors that I bought a second one for my home office. Everything went well for about a year on one pair and two years on the other. All I have used them for is basic household stuff, the heaviest thing I have cut through is cardboard on the end of a box a few times....cut well, not a problem.Well, the first pair actually broke right at the plastic handle. I thought that was odd but not a big deal since I could still use them. Then the other, newer one broke in the same exact spot! Again, did not affect the actual cutting function since the break was on the outside part and not against the inside of your thumb which would have been an issue had the crack gone through. When the second one broke I then began losing confidence in the quality of these.THEN the other day my husband came over to me with a rather surprised look on this face and showed the two BROKEN APART pieces of the scissors he had just used to cut a little thin strip of plastic off of a container!! You can see inside of where the two pieces are connected that they simply use a plastic housing to hold the piece together (on the end of where the screw goes in).Like I said previously, I have never had scissors break like this; I still have cheap scissors (old faithfuls I now call them) that I've been using for over 10 years!!I have provided pictures....hope that helps in your buying decision!
Danny Kaye is my favorit comedian of all time. This movie gives him a chance to show his comedy as well as the handsome dramatic actor too, well sort of. Danny and Bing are absolutely wonderful in this movie. It is a must see for all of you who enjoy the classic musicals with a real plot. The scenes are beautiful and the on screen chemistry between the actors and actresses is perfect. Buy this in place of "It's a Wonderful Life," and watch it throughout the entire year!
While the book is designed to help &quot;young&quot; chefs, I recommend it for any novice cook. Concepts that some books assume you know are explained in detail. Saves me from having to call MY mom for help!
These discs have been praised a lot, and rightfully. Maurizio Pollini's journey through the late Beethoven sonatas is a classic, a standard recording since it has appeared on LP in the seventies. Even those who find Pollini's readings too rigid and cold (I certainly don't) will have to admit that the clarity and force of his approach are just phenomenal. Still, there's more to this music, and you have not heard these sonatas in their entirety before you've heard Arrau, Schnabel, Solomon, Brendel and others alongside Pollini. There is more than one way to ascend the Mount Everest of Music, after all.
If you're sick and tired of the squirrels, this is what you need. It really works, I was amazed. It was a little pricey but worth it. It requires some installation and some strength to screw it into the ground. I'm so glad I got this because I was so fed up with the stinkin squirrels destroying everything.
This series is one of those ideas that we've all had, what if we could go back in time....1633 was decent. I could definitely tell that this was a 'collaboration' since Weber's style of writing is a little bit different from Flint's but I don't think most people will catch that.I basically read this non-stop over two days. The only complaint I have is I was confused as all hell on which book was the 'sequel' to 1632. For Pete's sake guys, I almost just said to hell with it and stopped reading the series. I had to jump online to make heads or tails of what book was next.Personally, Ring of Fire may be a good book, but I just don't want to waste time with filler short stories (that's just me).Anyways, I liked 1633 though it seemed to have less action than 1632 but it was still enjoyable. I'm getting into the characters and look forward to 1634 which as near as I can tell, "The Baltic Wars" is the next book in the series.Could you guys make it any more confusing? For crying out loud, we developed a number system a few thousand years ago for a reason. How about using it :)Book 1, Book 2, Book 3, etc. etc.
The last half hour is definitely tense and action-filled. But the preceding 90 minutes are convoluted and totally unbelievable. As a straight action film this would've worked, but as a treatise on US-Middle East relations, it fails miserably. BLACKHAWK DOWN is a much better military action film. A MIGHTY HEART is a much richer examination of US/Islamic relations in the current climate. The Kingdom tries to be both and fails. Go see the other two before wasting your time on this one.
I didn't think they could improve the theatrical release - but they did. The thirty minutes of extra fotage here add insight in to the characters and extra storyline, cunningly woven in seamlessly to the rest of the movie with full digital effects and new music. Nitpicky fans who complained of things being left out will be happy - there is now more talk of Isildur's shattered blade, an argument with the elves at Lothlorien, Gandalf uttering the tongue of Mordor at the council, and a whole lot more. The theatrical release was excellent, but this is better.Did I forget to mention the TWO WHOLE DISCS of extras? Everything but the sink in the set bathroom is here. Highly, highly, highly informative.Peter Jackson, you are the man.Oh, I read one review complaining of FOTR's lack of a Best Picture Oscar. Fear not, the Academy is waiting. In two years, when Return of the King is up, Peter Jackson will have his Oscars. They'll give it to the last installment, but it will really be for all three. Trust me, it will win. A franchise that is bringing in this much money can't loose. Money does it (look at Titanic).I digress. Get this version. Even if you have the other Theatrical release DVD, this one is worth owning as well - there are no repetive extras, and there are new commentaries. The studio did a good job of making it worth your while to own both without feeling cheated.
but definitely not comprehensive. I wish Kino would have taken the initiative to make a complete collection of his shorts. As it is, it's the only game in town right now if you want to watch any of Svankmajer's short films. Personally, I prefer his later work and find most of his earlier films on disk one boring.
I've held off on buying the Watchmen DVDs released so far, hoping for a "complete" set like this one (which I've now pre-ordered). What you get:Disc 1:* Watchmen: The Ultimate Cut Film (rated R), weaving together the "Tales of the Black Freighter" with the "Watchmen: Director's Cut". 215 minutes* Audio Commentary with Zack Snyder and Dave GibbonsDisc 2:* The Phenomenon: The Comic That Changed Comics* Real Super Heroes, Real Vigilantes* Mechanics: Technologies of a Fantastic World* Watchmen: Video Journals* My Chemical Romance Desolation Row* Under the Hood (rated PG)* Story Within a Story: The Books of WatchmenDisc 3:* Digital Copy of the Theatrical Version. (The drawback: no Blu-ray version of the theatrical release. But I didn't take a star off for this.)Disc 4:* Watchmen: The Complete Motion Comics (this is split across two discs on the non-Blu-ray edition) 325 minutesBlu-ray exclusive: Connect to Facebook through BD-Live. The content is not rated except where noted.
Two stars for the music....they didn't hurt the music. Minus 3 stars for messing with the color, bigtime...whose idea was it to add the colored-lens-look on and off thoroughout the movie? Wish I hadn't bought this one.
Some time ago I read one of Candace Robb's "Owen Archer" novels, since it coincided with my own area of expertise: Anglo-Gallo-Celtic society from the 13th into the 15th centuries, generally the period of the Welsh and Scots wars, the Black Plague, massive social and religious upheavals, and the Hundred Years' War. I found no gross fault with Robb's historical research, though it seemed lightweight and out-of-date, but decided that she simply can't write her way out of a paper bag.I thought that perhaps this book, set in Scotland in the marvelous year of 1297 -- the year of Wallace's victory at Stirling Bridge -- might be a good deal better, but A TRUST BETRAYED is a dud. It's not the worst historical novel I've ever read (she at least avoided the plunging neckline cliches, and the utterly horrible historical mistakes of BRAVEHEART and ROBERT BRUCE, certainly the most asinine movies ever made about Scots history), but Robb's tedious writing style hasn't improved and she has nothing to say. It took me nearly five days to finish a book that should have been digested in a day, and then I wondered why I'd bothered. Margaret Kerr is unbelievably irritating. She's superficially pious--did I ever get tired of all the masses and praying!--but so what? She's a manipulator, a whiner, a sniveling weeper and a cynic. Probably Robb doesn't realize just how unpleasant her main protagonist is. But then, everyone in this story is unpleasant. Perhaps Robb doesn't like Scots. She certainly doesn't give us any likeable or interesting ones.What kind of "mystery" is this when the primary dead guy turns out to have been himself a weak manipulator? Where the main character's quest--don't laugh!--involves chasing after her husband, whom she doesn't love (or maybe she does), and never catching him? Where her presumably beloved uncle acts like a grouchy ass and says not once but fifteen times, "You should not be here" or words to that effect? Where the leading Scots in this crucial year, namely William Wallace, John Comyn, Bishop Wishart and young Robert Bruce (please, not "THE Bruce", Candace!) never appear at all, and where no important English historical figures enter the story either, except by being distantly mentioned?Historically it is less accurate than it should be. Church law permitted disobedience to grossly illegal or immoral orders of a superior, even as the code of chivalry did, so Andrew comes across as a wimp. Why name a woman character "Tess" when the name "Teresa" was unknown in the British Isles until the cult of Teresa of Avila (1515-1582) spread throughout Europe? That's as anachronistic as putting Gypsies or a "witch" coven into 13th century Scotland. And why do we hear about the bloody events at Lanark at a distance? Wherever Margaret is, we can be damn sure that NOTHING important happens!The problem with this book isn't that it's a worthless mystery, or that there are historial boo-boos, though these both are exasperating. The problem is that it's much ado about nothing. It might have made a decent short story--but it just hasn't enough substance for a novel.
I'm so glad to have this. (I have Ikea Bekram wooden stools around the house which are also great--good-looking, useful, and less expensive but require assembly, don't fold, less waterproof.)It would not work for everyone but I'm using this as a shower stool while my leg is in a cast. It is the right height and is sturdy and solid enough for me to plop down on (I'm 120 lbs., 5'3"). Its big feet seem to make it less likely to damage my shower base than an official shower stool with narrower metal legs. I prefer this. It's all plastic. It looks less horridly medical. It can be folded away. And it will continue to be useful after the cast is off.Contrary to another review, it doesn't pinch my fingers. I like the closing/opening method.An added bonus is that when folded up it still stands well--so not only can I tuck it out of the way beside the toilet, while it's there it's useful as a support, when I push straight down with one hand.I'm glad to have it both for its intended and its unintended uses.
The tale of Albert Fish is, to put it mildly, sensational. It reminds me of the Marquis de Sade in the sense that Fish seemed to want to taste every possible (and then some) appetite before going to his grave. He was into all sorts of odd sexual perversions, including the habit of sticking pins into his genitals until dozens had accumulated. Fish not only committed cannibalism on his young victims he had the nerve to write to the victim's parents to tell them about how &quot;sweet&quot; tasting the victim was. He was, fortunately, finally captured and sentenced to death. Legend has it that Fish had to be restrained from rushing to the electic chair when they went to fetch for his execution, so eager was he to try this one last thrill. I've really only skimmed the surface of Fish's exploits, which would almost be heroic if not so horribly damaging to so many other people. The letters he wrote have to be read to be believed, even Rene Crevel would have been hard put to invent something this outrageous. This is decently written and researched, though one could always ask for more about this truly original American.
When they say Taste The Rainbow they mean it! Skittles are some of the best candies out there. The only problem I've ever had is that if I eat too many, like 2 bags worth in a short period of time, my gums become raw and have some stinging pain for a few hours. I guess thats just me being a hog though. Either way Skittles are the way to go for tangy, hard-shelled candy.
This Fein adapter is made of a flexible rubber and I now have two of these useful accessories. I was using duct tape for years to connect my Delta band saw to my dust collecting system. This was a much better solution. Also, I bought this adapter to connect my new Festool orbital sander to my Fein vacuum. Great product and value.
Finally - a product that appears to be well made & works well. My only complaint (and it's not really a complaint - I just didn't know to expect this) is that when you chop items like onions or cucumbers, they get really watery.
There is an awful lot of hype surrounding this novel and I hope that nothing bad happens to it. It is a sweet book and I'd hate for all the big, bad cynics out there to get a chance to stomp all over it. Alex's English is funny because it is comprehensible without being accurate. Is that a funny joke for the whole time? Maybe not, but the conceit is clever and works for the novel. Foer's work requires a sort of patience from the reader. After all, he's telling you with the title that he will eventually come to what he considers the payoff, so just wait for it.It is a backwards bildungsroman about a young man traveling to the East and metaphorically to the previous century to find out who saved his grandfather (and thereby how he himself was allowed to live). He is guided by Alex (who speaks a twisted English that befits his propensity for some fraction less than half-truths) and his &quot;blind&quot; grandfather, the driver. Now, come on, just reading that, you have to admit is funny.This book could have been run through the meticulous edits that would have polished it to a fine lustre but so many strange bits would have been buffed away that it could not have been worth it.So, you're still curious about the novel after everything alse you've read? Click away and have it sent so that you too will giggle while explaining the dog's name to your friends.
My daughter pointed this product out to me at a local department store and hinted that it would make a nice Christmas present for her. I found it on Amazon for $20.00 less than the department store and she was thrilled with her gift.
Tr&egrave;s belle version en cinq actes de 3 h 20 supervis&eacute;e par le producteur mythique John Culshaw. Grce aux ing&eacute;nieurs du son de Decca qu'il supervisait, on entend parfaitement tous les instruments, mme les plus discrets. Bergonzi est un tr&egrave;s bon Don Carlo. Fischer-Dieskau est un Rodrigue inattendu mais attachant. Bumbry, qui a toujours su trouver l'&eacute;quilibre entre la passion et la distinction, est &eacute;clatante en Eboli.
I have to agree with tthe chorus here, this is one amazing machine.I have a 96" projection system, fairly high end. After a few installation difficulties (largely based on the poor receiver manual) I put in one of the first DVD's that came to hand, Finding Nemo.The colors and detail blew me-and everyone else who saw it-away. Running at 720p, there are details in the image that simply could not be seen with my previous DVD player. Scales in the fish where before it was just a color. Amazing. In addition, there is a depth and subtley of color that was missing in my previous DVD player as well.Lastly, my wife has a DVD that came from Australia-Region 4, PAL output. I applied the 'hack', put the DVD in the player, and it immediately came out in beautiful 720p to my NTSC projector. So the unit does both multi-region and PAL-to-NTSC conversions. Amazing.Negatives-sure a couple. Mainly the remote. It is, to be honest, awful, the worst I have ever seen. My VCR, which is more than 15 years old, has a much better remote. There are too many buttons, they are almost all the same size, they important ones are illogically placed, the printing is too small, etc.And like most units, the manual could be better. Why can't someone write a manual that says, "If you wish to upconvert your DVD signal to 576p, 720P or 1080i, you need to scroll to the XXX setting with your remote and change the output resolution."Those two minor problems aside, if you need a new DVD player, or you have a HDTV of some size and want to wait out the moronic HD format war, get this unit, period.Now, I have to comment on one previous review. I avoid doing this, but in this case, the reviewer is passing out incorrect information and giving the unit an unwarranted poor review.:*****************************"The only digital output is DVI, not HDMI. Although they do provide a DVI-to-HDMI cable ... A pure HDMI feed is what I would prefer.""Because DVI only carries a video signal (no audio), you need to use either the stereo RCA cord provided or your own jacks to get any sound. HDMI, on the other hand, carries both audio and video, so you'd only need the one interface cord. "*****************************Yes, the output is DVI, but since the the unit comes with a (roughly 6') cord that is DVI on one end and HDMI on the other, it is really a non-issue. SInce DVI and HDMI have identical video signals, no 'conversion' is necessary.Secondly, you can use the digital (coax or optical) output of the Oppo, meaning you do not need RCA connectors, meaning analog signals, as the review implies. The digital signal sent out the coax connector should be run across a special coax cable, not just any old cable with the appropriate comnnectors.
I purchased this card when I bought a Cannon SD400. The Cannon only came with a 16 MB SD card, which is way too small. This SD card is very large and does quick transfers. The SD400 saw it easily and I did not have to format it special or anything. I have also used the card in my Acer Aspire laptop and it was able to find it and copy/edit the files on the card without any problems. I can take almost 400 highest quality pictures with this card, or up to 8 minutes of the best video with sound.All in all, the perfect compainion to the SD400.
I like the first season better. Something is not working right.The story is getting more and more unrealistic and all the felmale casts are getting more and more whore looking. How can you run the casino with that less people.
On its own, this is a good movie. The close-ups of eagles flying are amazing. And Paul Newman shines as narrator. The issue is if you never saw Meerkat Manor then this is really good film to get. But if you were a fan of Meerkat Manor then this movie pales in comparison. So I gave it a rating in between 3 and 5 depends on what you have seen before. If you are new to Meerkats I highly recommend getting Meerkat Manor season 1. In my opinion this was one of the top 5 television series of all time.
After several months of use, the FZ4 continues to impress me. I had originally planned to get the FZ5 to replace my 3-yr old Panasonic LC5 but when I tried both, I found that an extra $100 or so bought me a slightly larger LCD (not enough to matter), sound when using the movie mode (which I have not used on any digital camera) and other useless gadgetry, like choice of silver or black body. I feel that the FZ4 is slightly faster and noise, which is usually seen in the shadows at higher ISO, is slightly reduced---and no purple fringing, period. Both are excellent cameras within their design parameters as cameras for sports, family gettogethers,nature and travel, not portrait or studio work although enlargements on the FZ4 are fine up to and including 8x11 and often even larger. What it lacks is a complete set of manual controls but if you want that you must get a DSLR and a couple of zoom lenses which will set you back several thousand. My Panasonic DMC-FZ4 was well under US$250, including tax and shipping.
Imagine you can actually talk with the legends of advertising business. Imagine that they indeed have half an hour for you. Imagine them telling you the circumstances and inspiration behind their noteworthy projects. That is the kind of info you receive in this book. Great work of Hermann Vaske, in his interviews he knows which buttons to push in order to access the Creative Side of the Force. Highly recommended
A relative gave me this book and said it was sure to entertain, I wasn't disappointed. The book is a satire of the tobacco industry that goes even beyond what I thought was possible to promote tobacco. Although I don't smoke, the people peddling tobacco are unique? individuals that have quite a gift? for promoting something so toxic to the human body. Although the subject is appalling, I was laughing my head off at the outrageous interpretations of medical studies and clever rebuttals the tobacco spokesman came up with to counter the media and medical community. In a dark way, it really is a funny book....
We read this for a bookclub and were so disapointed. Dickens can be so good. I think this was a series written early in his career. It is trite, boring, rambling and the story goes nowhere. The characters will annoy.
Home Depot's Decorative Painting 1-2-3 (Hardcover) is a great guide for people that want to go the distance and do that little something extra that sets their home apart. It more then covers the basics, but it also offers a more detailed view of "How did they do that?" Loaded with photographs it takes you step by step into the realm of interior design. It is a worthwhile investment that not only refreshes one's memory on the basics, but also opens the door for something fresh with new possibilities.
Expect No Mercy is classic Nazareth. Hard and heavy in places, mellow and melodic in others, the album is a grab bag of different songs, all united by the eleements that make Nazareth one of the greatest bands in rock history: Unique and visionary guitar work, meaningful lyrics, and emotional and physical power, among other things. The title track is one of the best hard rock songs I've ever heard and probably should be listened to last as a sort of finale. The ballads on this one aren't as sappy as some of the others they've recorded. A few of them show up on all their albums.Nobody has ever accused Nazareth of inventing any new styles or being the first to do anything. This fact won't have any impact on your enjoyment of the music. But at the same time their influence has been widespread because they epitomize what is best about rock. They make inspiring, substantial music that has stood the test of time. If you want proof, Expect No Mercy will give you a piece of it.
About a year I paid about $40 each for two Essential Gear 12 LED lanterns--one for me and another to give as a Xmas present.After receiving these I saw these Innovage lanterns for less than half the price (about $15.00 each). I was annoyed at myself for spending so much for the E Gears, and bought these too. Again one for me and one for an Xmas gift.Today we had a power failure and for the first time I tried both lanterns in near total darkness. The extra money we spent on the Essential Gears was money well spent. The light output was significantly brighter and I was able to read (with the E Gear) in relative confort. Less so with the Innovage.
Being a fan of both Captain Marvel AND Alex Ross, I was at the comic store the day this came out knocking the door down to buy it. This is an excellent story of Captain Marvel as he visits a hospital for dying children and he struggles to realize that he can't save everyone. He meets a young boy who is abused by his father and after the wise old SHAZAM tells him that Marvel will meet someone in need of hope, he feels this boy is that someone. But is it?
If you purchase only one book on the subject be sure it is this one. Very comprehesive, free of jargon and inclusinve of almost anything you can think of on the matter of affairs. A book expecially for the professionals looking to learn about the nature and treatmeent of afairs without taking a week-long course. A gem.
Of all the movies and reviews of Humphrey Bogart, let this one stand and pronounce that the scene when he slaps Peter Lorre's face and tells him, &quot;shut-up and like it...&quot; is the defining moment in Bogart's career and especially this movie.Well crafted, but a bit loose on plot developement, The Maltese Falcon is what too many mystery/suspense movies trying to live up to an assumed description of what a &quot;noir&quot; film is supposed to be about, pledge their loyalties.Entertaining more than a fine film, The Maltese Falcon is a tour de force performance for Bogart. If you are a fan, then this is a must see. The camera work is also a good source for cameramen wannabes.
The first movie was epic and the sequel was craptacular. But this was more epic then the first. It had everything that should've been in the films...actual gore. Yeah this is free on youtube but its still going to worth it with the special features and it being on BluRayFull review on release
I just read through and reviewed two other Geocaching books, including the "for dummies" version, and none of those two books had any information that you can't figure out yourself just going out and doing geocaching.I expected the same from this book, but the "Idiot's Guide" is excellent!Everything from TIPS on how to get more accurate measurments from your GPS unit, to much more information on things you may not have used or done geocaching, everything you want to know about Latitude/Longitude and the many different formats you see them listed as, in addition to the history of how and why they came about.Everyone may think they know how to use a compass, but this book covers things most may not know about using compasses, and how they can help with geocaching.Even if you have been geocaching for a long time already, there are some helpfull hints in this book that can even teach the experienced geocacher a trick or two.The history is interesting all on it's own, what a great bonus!I am going to keep this, it is a great reference book!
Sam Raimi has had some great movies. Its interesting how he tosses in a bit of his own touch of comedy in his movies. I cant understand how some of these reviewers are glorifying this movie so greatly, my only guess is most of those reviewers are probably between 15 & 30 years old, anyone who is older than that and is a movie buff already knows Sam took bits and pieces from his past movies in the 80's & 90's and threw them in a big pile, the finished product is The Cabin in the Woods.The acting was mediocre, the special effects were average, the plot, well the plot was predictable, boring, lacked the element of surprise. I have 3 teenagers, ages 16, 15, 13 & all of them couldn't understand what the big rave was on this movie. At the end of the movie they were like, is that it?You can find bits and pieces of "30 days of night", "Drag me to Hell" & "Evil Dead" is this movie, the shadows of those movies are in the acting, the sets & the plot. Just take a look at the old cabin they go to in the movie, it has to be the old set of Evil Dead, the cabin is identical. That's just one example. The movie is ok if you have no other choices to pick from, but don't waste your money buying it.I know of the "plants" on this website that are here promoting certain movies. I dare to say most of the 5 star reviewers are plants. Lets take a look at the reviews on this movie in say....6 months...I'm betting we'll see the table turn and this movie will be down to 3 stars or less.
While not for the feint of heart, this exceptionally well-researched tome (clocking-in at over 400 pages) is a must-have for anyone interested in the history of particle physics in the 20th century. Although a bit out-of-date, with virtually no coverage of String theory or competing proposals to merge relativity and quantum mechanics, it is nonetheless a comprehensive narrative up through the "completion" of the Standard Model.Perhaps the book's greatest achievement is its ability to move back-and-forth between historical developments within the scientific community and the development of the science itself. With countless interviews and original source materials, Crease & Mann capture the excitement of scientific discovery while giving an excellent layman's overview of those discoveries.This is a compelling read, and highly recommended to anyone interested in this fascinating field.
Not at all what you would expect. Picoult's intelligence shines through the pages of this novel like a bright ray of light. The author's commitment is undeniable and immediately visible from the first sentence.The story starts when the protagonist, (Anna) decides to make a choice that could rip her family apart. That's the start of a deadly snow ball affect. And carrying the same analogy, this book is a blizzard. Filled with drama, questions, and a few revelations, it's hard not to get an emotional attachment to the characters, which we all can relate to. In this book, there never is a dull moment. And to say the ending is "shocking" is like comparing a boulder to a pebble, a HUGE understatement.
I finished this book in two days. Lots of good stuff here. Not your standard cookie cutter fantasy novel. The plot twists are surprising and fresh. The main character is a strong female character, very well rendered. There is some sexual content which may make this inappropriate for young readers.
This is not the worst book I've read this year, but it isn't very good. &quot;Wild Justice&quot; is the story of a serial-mutilator-killer and the people tracking him. It was apparently intended to keep readers in suspense until the end, but I spotted the killer in the first 50 pages. It was obvious because the author, Phillip Margolin, tried so hard to point at us at everyone else. Besides, the killer kept showing up in the right place at the right time.The book was very trying to read. First of all, the language of both the narrative and the dialogue was a little off. No one really speaks like that. Second, supposedly intelligent people kept doing really stupid things to keep the plot moving, always a bad sign in any story. Lastly, Margolin kept &quot;shoe horning&quot; his plot. By that I mean he kept writing himself into a corner and then resolving his dilemma by forcing improbable solutions on the reader. It was almost as though he wrote the book without any idea of where he was going. So, he just &quot;winged it&quot;.Apparently, this was a New York Times Bestseller. What a scary thought. On the other hand, &quot;Wild Justice&quot; does hold out hope to any expiring authors out there. If this can get published and become a best seller, than there's hope for anyone.
When using this SD card, the units would often say the card was locked even when the switch was clearly not locked.
And the first novel in this series was pretty dang good. The only thing that gave me fits was that there were so many characters that until one was introduced at length, I couldn't get a good fix on his or her place in the story. But I was pleased with the plotting as well as the development of the main characters.
This wonderful book is also in print as a section of Carson's _Plainwater_collection, which is much more broadly available. If you're nuts about her work, you might want to have it anyway. And you should at least want it, because she's great, as much as the word "great' has meaning. She has Ann Sexton's confessional toolkit, balanced by a scholarship that Sexton never had. Her essay ideas are always fascinating. Her translations are rich and spare at the same time. She's great.
It's easy to dismiss Maburaho as simply another fanservice riddled, harem anime but Maburaho differs in that it actually has some heart to back up the troves of gratuitous fanservice it forces upon its viewers and that for heaven's sake, it doesn't take itself seriously. It is deliberately over the top, (just look at the size of some of those jiggling spheres...could anyone draw those with a straight face?) silly, touching and effectively hilarious. Each character retains enough emotional depth and uniqueness to remain interesting and endearing throughout. (although, admittedly, I couldn't help but feel that Rin felt somehow incongruous most of the time)Anyone who approaches this anime expecting to see the pinochle of dramatic achievement is missing the point (and, quite frankly, is the biggest boob involved in this whole thing) Despite all of its assets, Maburaho does have some substantial flaws-the story REALLY loses its steam about halfway through the series and resorts to some pretty dull filler episodes before regaining its momentum towards the end, which brings up another problem...the ending is way too convenient...it certainly doesn't ruin the series, though and may even put a smile on your face. All in all, Maburaho is simply an anime to be laughed at-it was written, directed and animated as such, so why not just sit back and do just that? Who knows? If you're the sentimental type, it just might even touch your heart. It's at least worth a try, don't you think?
What a pleasure to listen to this intelligent program.Anderszewski doesn't live in the past and bring a contemporary flair to his playing: this no Gould caricature nor academic Beethoven. This is simply a sensitive musician who offers you a glimpse at the composers' genius.Still, this is not an ego trip and he respects the style of the periods. His Bach is superb but really the Beethoven just was amazing. I did not find in his playing the hints of contriveness that in my opinion appear in his earlier recordings. Sometimes his intelligence got in the way of romantic music when a simplier approach would have carried the day. But even then Anderszewski was interesting and you may or not have agreed with him but you can't take him for a Lang Lang...Here beethiven is everything, sensitive, brutal, modern... and one can feel a deep connection with this music for the pianist.Let's not now forget Webern. I am not a great fan of his music but when Boulez conducts or Anderszewski the music comes alive and opens up.My only criticism would go to the sound engineer who allowed to much reverb (natural or not) to cloud the clarity of the upper register.The program chosen by Anderszewski and not by some gready producer shows the same ideas through a Baroque, Classical and Modern prism.Bravo!
This is very poor quality. It arrived damaged, but I tried using it. Bad idea. Sent it back. Pay the extra and get a better quality skillet.
This is a well-balanced set of knives and a good value for the money. They are rather sharp and hold their edge very well. I have not had the opportunity to sharpen them yet to see how difficult that process is. My experience with other Victorinox knives suggests that sharpening will be an easy process.
I've been using these for my essential oils. With essential oils, the number of drops is really more important than any other measurement, so I haven't tested out the accuracy of the markings along the side. They seem sturdy enough to stand up to repeated use. The drops that I get from these are uniform in size, which was exactly what I needed. The plastic is thicker than I thought it would be (so more durable), but still easily thin enough to be able to use the dropper as intended.They're a little hard to clean afterwards. It's hard to get every bit of liquid out of the droppers. I use a different dropper for each oil, so it's less important, but I would like to be able to clean them better.I wrote the names of the oils on the side with a black Sharpie but they got rubbed off pretty quickly. I think I'm going to have to use tape and write the names of the oils on the tape. Sharpie ink doesn't seem to stick very well.
Honestly, I don't make an effort with those titles anymore...Short and Sweet: Great story, Great art, Not Slight, Totally Right. Excelsior! &lt;----Whoops, I think I just pissed off a god...
Songs of Enchantment is a sequel to Booker Prize winning The Famished Road--one of the best novels I've ever read. But Ben Okri's attempt to outdo his first novel with this sequel had a disastrous result. He gives the readers an overdose of magic and supernatural. He describes one strange event after another (and almost in every succeeding sentence), distracting the readers and leaving them no time to savor one magical event at a time. (The Famished Road just has an amount of magic just enough for the readers to enjoy.) Ben Okri's prose has always been beautiful to read, but this time it didn't work. I couldn't find patience to finish the entire book.
I'm not a big fan of Metheny's more experimental forays like Song X, but this album is a good balance between all-out "free" avant-garde and his more accessible albums.It's a bit jarring at first, but with repeated listens you'll begin to appreciate the artistry behind these great musicians. If you're looking for music you can play in your car or something, don't buy this. This is for serious listeners who are willing to take the time to really get into the essence of the music.
The first disc is still the sound of a band of British gents trying to create American R&amp;B and blues music. Get Off Of My Cloud or Ruby Tuesday don't make me think, &quot;Wow. This is the world's greatest rock and roll band.&quot; &quot;These guys sure have a talent for writing excellent pop songs.&quot; comes to my mind more. The second disc, however, is energetic, inspired, amazing blues rock. They experiment. They progress and, unlike the Beatles who became absurd, through it all they kept their blues and pop sensibilities. This was the Stones run for the throne. This kind of material gave them the title, &quot;world's greatest rock and roll band.&quot;
I can't say I was shocked when I listened to a Victor Villareal related band and loved them upon first listen. I can say I was amazed at the amount of talent shown on this record. The first track is deceiving, displaying a soft, yet complex, yet relaxing acoustic number in the vein of the more mellow Joan of Arc recordings (another band Victor was involved with, for those who are new to this band...you should check them out too, by the way). However, this serves as merely an intro to a much more diverse and melodic instrumental wonderland, that is unleashed upon you right after the drums kick off track 2. This is just proof that instrumental bands can be just as deep as groups with vocals, as well as the fact that some bands can do much better without lyrics explaining anything. The guitar work on this album is like a firing squad, but its not all over the place. Its extremely melodic and flows quite nicely. There are an abundance of off-timing parts, but it all clicks. Fans of Joan of Arc, Owen, Cap'n Jazz, and other great Chicago area bands of the genre, take note. But chances are if you loved those bands, you know and love G&amp;V already. New listeners be warned, the Precious Blood LP is extremely hard to find, and basically out of print, so unless you're lucky enough to find a copy collecting dust on a record store shelf one day, be aware that SixGunLover has recently re-relased this LP on a collection/discography entitled &quot;Addicts and Drunks&quot;, which not only contains every song from Precious Blood, but also has a remastered verison of the long out of print EP, and as a special treat, a 4-track recording from one of their first practices. Its definitely available everywhere and the distribution for this record is much more generous than the last, and basically makes the LP obsolete in a way, unless you want it for the keepsake value. Anyway, you will not be disappointed with any material this short-lived band has released. Fear not of being easily bored with it either. I know a lot of people are iffy when it comes to instrumentals, but I guarantee you, the musicianship this band forks over will make you forget why you even need to hear someone sing. So quit scratching your head and staring at your monitor and order this album, pronto. Boo yah.
After seeing the stage version performed at my school, I have to say that I like the movie's soundtrack much better than the stage'ssoundtrack(although, I have yet to buy the stage's soundtrack...I'm just assuming). I think it was smart to swap "Cool" with "Officer Krupke". If you think about it, the Jets wouldn't be singing a humorous "Officer Krupke" right after their gang leader, Riff, has been killed. I also like that they moved "I Feel Pretty" before the rumble unlike the play, where they put it after the rumble. It just doesn't make sense that there would be a light song after such drama. The only reason I gave this amazing soundtrack four stars is because my favorite song "A Boy Like That/I Have A Love" was shortened compared to the play. I think what it all comes down is you just just make an investment and buy the stage's soundtrack AND the movie's soundtrack.
I have used Bach Flower remedies on myself with great success, so I became interested in trying them on our cat. She is a very nervous animal and spends lots of time just hiding. I read this book cover to cover and it gave me some ideas for how to treat her. She is definitely better since I began adding a drop or two of a remedy to her drinking water.The book begins with chapters on what Bach Flower remedies are and why they are appropriate for animals. This is followed by an alphabetical list of all the remedies and conditions they may benefit. It is all very easy to understand.A very useful book.
Much to my dismay, these 2 books were written 24 years ago. They should have been left there and not re-issued. I've never read Ms. Daily before and picked this up thinking it was new. I should have checked the first edition dates inside first. Someday, I'll learn.In "The Lord of the High Lonesome" we have a 21 year old brat named Kit. She is angry all the time, nasty to everybody and doesn't give anyone a chance. She dresses in baggy, ratty men's clothes, wears on old cowboy hat to hide her "glorious" hair and is, generally, loathesome to family, employees and townspeople alike. No wonder the hero fell madly in love with her. What's not to love? I couldn't even finish it. I did skip to the end to see how they worked it out. Ugh.In "Heart of Stone" we have Kit's opposite. An arrogant, overbearing, cruel man. When we first meet him, he has a blond bimbo installed in his suite at the inn he owns. He is nasty to our TSTL heroine and, pretty much, lets her know a threesome would be interesting. Again, we can see why she fell head over heels for the jerk. He dumps her cruelly and goes away for many months. She pines. She loses weight. She cries a lot. She "looves" him forver. One day, he waltzes back in to her life, tells her he's sort of sorry, that he loves her and will she marry him. After all the pain he put her through, she falls into his arms and ecstatically accepts his proposal. No pride or self-esteem, at all!I'm not sure how Ms. Daily's current writings stack up against this garbage and I guess I won't find out. I don't want to risk another penny to find out.Save your money for something better. The back of a cereal box would be my recommendation.
Good Quality for the price. Very surprised. Very happy with the product. Very well-built & sturdy. Wide seat. Lightweight - probably less than 20 lbs.
I didn't think it was possible but God of War II is every bit as good as the original. The storyline, voice talent, graphics and mechanics of the game are still top notch. The game seems a little shorter but that could quite possibly be due to the fact that I didn't have to outswim a speeding underwater barrier like in the first one...or maybe it was the absence of those cursed spinning knife totems that I repeatedly fell off of inches from the top. I cringe just thinking about it.The game remains challenging although not nearly as frustrating as the first. The story is completely engrossing and the cut scenes are nothing short of fabulous. If you're concerned that this time around you'll have a kinder, gentler Kratos...think again. This guy has issues and works them out by slaughtering everything in his path. Definitely not for kids but the rest of us can delight in the sheer chaos.Some of the unlockables are downright silly though...like replaying the game dressed in a fish costume...yeah, it's funny for about 5 minutes. You do get a few nice unlockables though, like character development, scene creations, and the ability to replay with your unlocked weapons (on the same difficulty rating). The God Of War games are must haves for the PS2!
I have this book and several other Spanish language books. This is the best of the lot. It has a dictionary of most common words, a useful phase section with pronunciation and useful information about Spain and Latin America. It is worth every bit of the price. Es muy bueno.
This season is better after the 4th one with all its witches and countesses. Too bad Jensen Ackles got pancaked by a meteor, but that just freed him up for Supernatural, another great show. This season, Clark loses his dad, which is sad, but in the plus column, he does get to see Lois do a striptease. Although she failed to actually remove any clothes. That's the point of a strip club.. so I'm told.. And, Clark displays his mind-blowing lack of intelligence by NOT telling Lana his secret even though we know she will be totally ok with it. (see season 6)And, to prove I have no life, I watched the season with a checklist in front of me, and here's what I counted as far as who Clark saved this season, and how many times.Lana=6Lex=1Jonathan=2Martha=4Chloe=3Pete=0Lionel=2Lois=3Random Hot Chick=1Random Guy=4Someone who was just trying to kill Clark=1Other (group of people, entire world, etc.) 2Total individual saves, not counting "other"=27
Shannon Tweed just oozes sex appeal,which was the only reason I even bothered to watch this movie(and all of her other movies)While the typical short-commings of this movie would be obvious to most familiar with her work(bad acting,bad script)it unfortunatly doesn't make up for it in the other areas fans would be familiar with(lots of nudity,steamy sex scenes).Shannon Tweed is very rarely nude in this movie,and the sex scenes are very watered down and dissapointing(expect alot of close-ups of two heads kissing and slow motion sex scenes)Forget Night Fire,ifyou really like to look at Ms.Tweed,check out Scorned(four stars!)Body Chemistry 4(three stars)or even Possessed By the Night(two stars)
I love this mouse because it's accurate, never lags, and is the right size for my hand. However, in less than four months the black rubber where my index finger goes started coming apart from the rest of the mouse, and now there is a "bubble" underneath my index finger. I'll soon be looking for a new mouse with a top skin of hard plastic.
One finds out pretty clearly and directly who the murderer is about midway through the book. At that point then, since there's a lot of book left, the plot must follow the police closing in on the killer and an exciting finish. That requires attention to pacing with matters picking up and slowing down. That's what made Da Vinci Code such a good read as well Le Carre' novels like Tinker, Tailor.... That's what's absent from elevating this book above the pack. Otherwise, it's not awful, it's just no better or worse than the other tripe out there that serves as a backdrop permitting us to identify better work. And distasteful, as well as not credible, bits like Kate's having her coffee handground by an ancient Chinese woman (must be about 150 years old she opines) on an ancient handgrinder (or perhaps it's driven by a waterwheel) that she opines must be about 250 years old. Oh daahling, ratherrr! Puh-leeze!Actions speak louder than words so my action on the murderer being revealed midway though and then the plodding pace the plot then takes was to skip to the end to see if perhaps there was some twist inserted in the interim pages that resulted in someone else being the murderer. Nope. Instead, through an incredible plot device, the murderer instead comes to them and is about to shoot them when someone dives forward, windowglass shatters as simultaneously others enter the room and the murderer is off balance when the gun goes off. Hmm, never heard of that happening in a mystery before. What makes that device work is when the pacing just carries you along, otherwise it's a yawner at the end.
I've tried the spaghetti & meatballs (which is really darned good), the hawaiin nuggets (which I'd rather not have to try again), and the vegetarian steak... The Vegetarian steak is definitely edible, to the point where I'd be ok with eating it again.The "steak" bits are quite tasty, have a good texture, and quite plentiful. The biggest issue with the veggie steak is the texture of the vegetables: on the box, it shows all sorts of nice yummy crisp looking veggies... whereas it turns out its really just a gelatneous goo. It's pretty yucky looking, but it tastes decent.Definitely good for camping, or if you need to eat kosher on a business trip.
A wittily written but repetitive analysis of the strange workings of the human mind, in the tongue-in-cheek guise of a comically long-winded multiple-choice personality quiz. Though the insights are dead-on with regard to the oddities of human behavior, particularly our schadenfreudenous nature, it's nothing one doesn't already know -- though I suppose the point is to demonstrate it's not just an anomaly with the individual but a universal series of character failings. However comforting (or discomforting) that may be, it soon takes an onanistic PHI-101 quality. It's a book that loves to hear itself talk.
I have two of these hubs on two different machines, and they have both performed flawlessly with a wide variety of USB devices. Buy with confidence. On the other hand, two out of the eight blue LEDs have perished - though this had no effect on the real function. Everything considered, good value for the small price.
There is no replacement for this kitchen tool. From zesting citrus to grating parm to grating fresh ginger, there is just no substitute. No regular grater can get those perfect little confetti-sized micro-shavings. It is just essential. I have two so I never to go without when one is dirty and I probably use them at least 5 days a week. I had to make a lemon tart in someone's kitchen who didn't have one of these and found it to be so impossible that I went to the store and bought a new one. If you cook you need one of these. It's like having a knife. You just need it. If your items aren't coming out the other side, just tap it on the edge of your bowl and it falls right out. Easy.I have had the same one for probably 8 years and put it in the dishwasher every time I use it and it's still very sharp and functions perfectly.
I had great expectations when I ordered this book based on it's title - but it quickly disappointed. On page 39 under the heading PATENTS it explains that "A patent is a time-limited, exclusive right that is granted for an invention" duh? I think I already KNEW THAT! You get the picture? It's a very elementary book - you'd have to be absolutely green not to know most of the stuff in this book. Except for the fact that half of it is full of legal blurb about Geneva convention, Rome convention, Nairobi(?) Treaty and loads of useless information. Nothing dynamic about how companies with a decent patent portfolio can ACTUALLY capitalise or profit as the title suggests. A useless book.
I think this is an excellent book to start reading Marquez. The book is short enough to allow a hesitant reader to finish it and see the full effect of his work.
I purchased this for my son for Christmas, because he loves anything Army. By the day after Christmas, there was a rip in the crotch, the knees were worn, and one of the stars fell off the top. He only wore this in the house for a few hours!The top does not button up, like the picture shows. It is one long velcro strip that fastens the shirt together. The stars are hot glued on. The pants are not sewn together well at all, and the fabric is very hard feeling.For the price, this costume could be made better. I would not suggest purchasing this one, unless you only intend to wear it once, because it will fall apart!
I have been using Dr. Weimer's approach in my college courses for the past two years. My students are completely invigorated. Time and time again they say (and I have this in writing, too) that for the first time they feel empowered and in charge of their education. I'm constantly "wowed" by their responses and improved work ethic. My students have earned more "A" grades than previous semesters. I thought "maybe my point cut-offs are too low?" For Spring 2012, I raised the point levels and the students responded by working even harder and still earning A"s. For example, in my Western Lit course, to achieve an A, a student would have to choose to write over 22 pages (that's typed) of essays on topics related to the reading. They would have taken at minimum 5 tests and a midterm, read at least 5 books and participated in class discussions, activities and reviews. I vary my teaching methods between lecture/presentation, group work, and individual work.Some reviewer here really missed the point of students working on class participation policy -- that's the best idea ever. We spend two class periods at the beginning of the semester in discussion about participation. About 95% of the students agree that professors always say (on syllabus or in class) that "participation counts" or "participation will be x% of your grade," but they never explain exactly what participation is or how they're going to grade it. My students create standards, which you'd be surprised are not wishy washy or loose. When asked to chime in, they are serious about their education and want a classroom that supports their learning. Every single class, on their own (without me saying a word) has outlawed cell phones and texting. Doesn't mean they don't slip up, but they have clear ideas about standards. If teachers would allow even the conversation about participation, they might get more buy-in from their students. Participation becomes a factor in their grades, worth 100 points: 50 earned by writing 5 pages or more assessing their own participation and up to 50 points that I use to grade their participation -- using the class policy. Students can opt into the Participation points or not. Rarely does a student opt out. That means everyone in my class is actively trying to participate all the time. And I don't have to prod them and they know the rules and what they need to do to earn the points.Look, here is the bottom line, everything in life is optional. Really. Either you show up, or you don't. Before I changed to this approach, I would always have some students who would treat assignments as if optional, not do work, not come to class, think they could do make up work at the end and it would be fine. But now, actually telling them "everything is optional" -- lets the cat out of the bag. In my class, with the exception of two assignments, everything is optional. Can a student pass if he or she only does the required two assignments. Heck, no. The deck is certainly stacked. But here's the thing, a student who hates literature and doesn't really want to read all the books and doesn't want an A, can certainly find a way to learn enough to earn a "C" -- and isn't that okay? Heck, yes.I give each student a complete list of assignments and due dates and point values for each assignment on a sheet where he or she can record points. I keep a copy of the same sheet. Students always know how they stand in the class. This has made me a better teacher because I return work within at least two class meetings. In fact, many students said last year that I was the best ever at getting work back. Well, I have to thank Dr. Weimer, even though she didn't really mention that in the book. But in order for the approach to work, professors need to step up and be involved, too. The two "rules" are great . Once the due date is passed, the work cannot be accepted. I always had a "no late work" policy, but now I don't hear whining and begging. The other rule is that in order to earn any points for an assignment or test, students must earn at least 50% of the points available. I ask the students, "why?" And they immediately tell me, "so you don't get junk." Bravo. See? They know. They feel like they are being treated as adults, sometimes for the first time in school.At the end of the semester, I ask students to assess this method of setting up the course. The letters can be anonymous or not. Doesn't matter. Overwhelmingly, the students love this approach. The line I get the most is, "I wish other professors would try this."
this was a gift, it was great when I saw it. im sure it still is a great film. I hope
Poor guy did not last even overnight. I low quality toy that gets tangled in it's own shoot just from looking at it. Sadly another junk.
The visual style of this film reminded me of the fantasy movies of the 1980's like "The NeverEnding Story", "Return to Oz" and "Dark Crystal". However, much like the modern Harry Potter movies and Star Wars prequels, the filmmakers have diminished character development in favor of large loads of computer effects and action scenes. I would think that a child who sees it without having read the book will be a bit baffled as to why some of these events are taking place.For instance, it's not explained that the movie begins in World War II era London (I think that would help kids who haven't read the book understand why the Pevensie family's home is being bombed), Lucy and Mr. Tumnus meet and 4 minutes later are soul mates and best friends forever (a little more character interaction would have made Tumnus' fate much more meaningful). The beavers explain the great prophecy about as dramatically and effectively as my mom trying to explain an episode of "Lost". Before his self-sacrifice, Aslan says and does practically nothing to clue you in as to why he is the savior of Narnia (a few scenes of the kids getting to know more about the history of Narnia and showing Aslan passing on words of wisdom would have raised the emotional level considerably).On the upside...If you HAVE read the book, it's quite fun to watch many of these scenes come to life. Tilda Swinton as the White Witch is spot on! I would eat her turkish delight any day of the week. The little girl who plays Lucy is absolutely perfect. If being adorable were an Olympic event, she would certainly take the gold medal. Also, Aslan's sacrifice is shockingly graphic and disturbing. I think they might have brought in Mel Gibson as guest director for this scene.Speaking of which, all the Christian allegory is here if you're looking for it. It's actually quite subdued. Similar to "Lord of the Rings" and the ORIGINAL Star Wars trilogy, this movie stresses the importance of courage, honor and friendship. As our society becomes increasingly more shallow and materialistic with every day that goes by, I welcome a kid's movie like this, even with it's flaws.
I saw the Carleton Watkins exhibit at the Paul Getty Museum in Southern California and I was really blown away.When I went to buy the book in the museum store, they were out. Saddened, I looked online and of course Amazon.com came to the rescue, with a better price as well.The photographs and the writing are great. Well worth it.
Alright, I see other reviews below that have stated that if you use the correct screwdriver, duh, it will open. Well guess what, it won't on mine. The screws just turn and turn and never come completely loose. Three different people worked on this thing Christmas day! They need to redesign the battery compartment. It looks like a fun toy, but until we return ours and get one that we can put batteries in, we will never know.
Quincy Jones, one of American's finest men of music and entertaiment wrote a mediorce book. Most of the passages read like he is just talking to a tape recorder remembering events of his life. A good ghost writer should have been considered to give the text some more arty flava. That said, I was impressed by his vast work ability and multi-faceted lifestyle. He is a true legend among the living. Like the Energizer bunny, he just keeps going and going.
I was very disappointed with this product. As others have stated, most of the loops are sounds you probably wouldn't even use in the first place. Apples jam packs have much better loops. If your looking for some good loops I would look elsewhere.
One of my top 10 favorite rock albums. Love every song. For ten dollars, you'd have to be a total dumbazz to not pick this up.Tracks:1. Aces High - 5/52. 2 Minutes to Midnight 5/53.

I purchased this book for my husband, who is beginning piano lessons at age 44. Since he's an adult player, I thought he would get bored and frustrated with the curriculum he's currently doing - and he is - so I got him the book to mess around with. He's a lover of classical music and I thought this would give him a quick win once in a while.I would not recommend this book, and I wouldn't purchase it again - in fact, I think I'm going to try to hide it from him.My main issue is that the arrangements are, in my opinion, very poorly done. They've simplified Bach's "Minuet in G" to not include chords. The left-hand arpeggios in "Fur Elise" have been reduced to fifths - understandable for small hands that may not have the reach, but unnecessary for adults. The treble portion of "Moonlight Sonata" has been split into two hands, so the grounding bass portion is gone - and what's worse, the left and right hands are actually overlapping each other in this arrangement, so it's not really an easy arrangement anyway.With these arrangements, my husband's putting a bunch of work into learning a bad version of a piece that he's not going to want to learn the real version of when he's ready. The arrangement for "Minuet in G" in particular bothers me - after three months of lessons, he's absolutely capable of playing the original "Minuet in G", but had he learned this book's arrangement first, he wouldn't want to.In the interests of full disclosure, my husband likes being able to play some tougher pieces now - but the arrangements are kind of tough for me to listen to.Note: I purchased this book in 2009, and it is no longer spiral-bound.
An orchestra in top form with one of the worlds best romantic conductors.Outstanding playing with sensitive and true interpretation.The 4th symphony is superb (I own 7 other recordings of that piece and it is my favorite). The 5th is excellent with probably the best French Horn solo of the second movement ever recorded. The 6th is also very good, passionate yet not overbaring.I am not always a fan of Kurt Masur but there is no doubt in this recording that he is a conductor of the highest caliber.
Both volumes of this title are top notch. The sound is rich and quietly rhythmic. The inclusion of vocals blends perfectly with the instrumentation. And while the sound is hypnotic and relaxing, it is never monotonous. My only regret is each time a track ends...
One of the absolute best pagan/metal albums I own. There are Latvian warriorsongs from the 12th century incorporated into the band's compositions. And it's magnificent. The guitar work is what stands out to me though, effective and crushing. Battle sounds, nature sounds and water crashing up against the side of a boat, make the imagination abound with accurate visions. Kauja Pie Saules, " brings you back to the time when countless bloody battles were fought. Time passes on....but legends remain, nothing's forgotten. Our banner adorned by Perkons sign is still flying"......... Brilliant album from a historical and musical perspective. Get this now.
Rock Candy is right up there with Zep's "Kashmir" or The Nuge's "Stranglehold" as greatest hard rock song of all time.The songs are as good a collection as has ever been assembled. And whether on his own or with Van Halen, Hager never matched the powerful singing on this LP, in my opinion. His voice is way up in the CD mix.Which brings me to the main problem with the CD I own. The sound is poor. It sounds like the four guys are standing in a phone booth, the sound is so condensed. I'd loove to see this Top 10 All Time Hard Rock album gets REMASETED with better sound and separation. The drums on Rock Candy should blow out your speakers, and Ronnie's guitar assualt on "Space Station" should seer thru your speakers. Here's hoping a great, great album gets it's just reward. It's a 10 Star album with improved sound.The recent Best of Montross does improve on the sound, includes arguably the top four cuts from the LP, but you've enjoyed the sequencing on this album for years as is, it is meant to be heard in this order and LOUD.Of what a time we had....
I am a beginner in Kendo so take this all with a grain of salt.I thought this was a tremendous book. Well written, clear, and thorough. I think it rivals "Kendo: the Definitive Guide" as one of the two best Kendo books. Particularly interesting, though not useful unless you're already a sandan or so, are the sections on Nito and Jodan. I haven't seen info on those kamae in English anywhere else.Good book and a worthy addition to your library.
The MC-V5737 is a good vacuum. I don't think it's necessarily the best, but for the combination of price, performance and weight, it does a very good job.The unit weighs 15 pounds on our digital scale, which is a bit less than Amazon shows (17 pounds). This is a plus for us. We wanted a light weight unit.The "head" is only 12 inches wide, which was another plus for us. It is more maneuverable because of the smaller size. It seems many vacuum's today are 14 inches.The cord is a bit short. We'd like another 6 feet or so. It's not the end of the world, just a bit of a nuisance. The unit is primarly plastic, which helps reduce the weight so we can live with that. The instructions were not as clear as they could have been and the suction hose is in the way a little when you are winding the cord up.Overall: We'd buy it again.
This is definitely the worst magazine I've ever "read." I give the postmod quotes to "read" because there's absolutely nothing in this magazine to read. Unless you count ad copy. 90% of the clothing and stuff they highlight is insanely expensive. Need help selecting a $300 skirt? Then 1) this is the mag for you and 2) you're kind of pathetic. I got a free 1-year subscription so at least I didn't pay for it.
I have hundreds of discs, and this is in the top 5. Maybe the number 1. All instrumental, this is thunderous bass (I'm underestimating it), guitars, organs, drums, and memebers of the London Symphony Orchestra. The whole disc is based around the bass. Every song here is great. Every one. You only need one listen to adore this artistic creation. Hints of prog-rock, metal, blues tinged, this is immense power. Hypnotic, repetitive bass grooves. This guy is a bass institution and this shows why. The best song here is Snake Eyes. I wouldn't really call it a song. It's more like a piece. A rock symphony. Gripping. Starts off with a repetitive bass line that is the undercurrent of the piece. Guitars come in and the strings inertermingling with it. Organ solos, 2 of them. Guitars, drums, strings on top and interwoven. Then the part that will freak you out. The bass line becomes the theme. The instruments go away. The only thing that is left is the London Symphony Orchestra, playing that bass line over and over with strings, until it ends. Seven minutes. What comes through and what the point is, is to show how these delicate strings can coexist with the metal like bass, guitars, that chaotic organ and drums. When the organ starts, the chaos begins. Everyone playing on top of each other. It ends gently. Stunning contrast. That song alone is the disc. The others are one notch below it, but anything would be one notch below this. Thes songs are still one notch higher than anyone else's. If you think life is about experiencing things, you have to buy this, cause you want to hear this before you die. Don't die, just buy this. You will be blown away completely. One of the best Rock discs I have ever heard, and I've been listening for over 40 years.
As I've said in past reviews, Ute Lemper is not always an easy listen, but well worth the effort. On her latest disc, "Blood and Feathers" Ute captures herself live at the Cafe Carlyle. On one of the liner notes written by a critic, he states how refreshing it is to see a woman perform who isn't pandering to the audience, but allowing you to witness her authenticity. So is the case with Ute this time around. Her song selection is all over the place, but each version she makes her own. I continue to love that she is not belting out better known standards to please the masses. She picks unique songs and sings and speaks in several languages on the CD. She maintains her consistency. I imagine she does the same show all over the world, not "Americanizing" it for NYC. I've seen Ute live several times and while her witty banter is intact on the disc, what I longed for was her mannerisms, her coy smile, expressive eyes and movement, and her glamourous vamping. Fortunately for all of us, the DVD is only a few weeks away. Ute fans enjoy this sassy disc. Bon Appetit!
This is the one to buy. Unparalleled in its energy, fun, and effectiveness, this video is the one I'd like to have if I were stranded on a desert island. Amy Dixon knows her stuff!
Its a great little book, many of the birds featured in it i've seen in my yard. There's good info about each species.
This is my first fancy phone, and I'm impressed. It's a nice solid phone, not too big or heavy, but packed with features.It's a fine cellphone with good sound quality and a usable speakerphone.The mobile versions of Gmail and Google Maps work very well. The built-in web browser is pretty good. I also tried the Opera download, which works OK, but I prefer the built-in browser.The camera is surprisingly good -- I didn't buy it for the camera, but it works great for daylight shots, to the point where I will probably stop using my (older) camera entirely.The screen, while very sharp, is a bit small for my eyes.The keyboard is a gigantic improvement over keypad text input, though still far worse than a laptop of course.Wifi works well for web browsing & email.I am not very impressed by the built-in Voip features -- it was a selling point for me, but it's clear that it's not quite ready for prime time. I did eventually get my SIP account configured, but it was a struggle, and the end result was not very satisfying. My main problem was that incoming SIP calls would usually not ring the phone, instead going straight to voice mail. I had better luck with Fring (a third-party downloadable app) which also supports Skype and Google Talk, but Voip on this phone, while workable and very cheap, is still far from the convenience and reliability of regular cellular voice.I am very happy with this phone as a music player. Sound quality is great, and with a 2GB Mini SD card, capacity is pretty good. My main quibble is that I had to buy an adapter in order to use regular headphones.[...]
I bought this months ago. I needed to mount a blue ray player in the bedroom. I already had the TV mounted up high on the wall so I could watch television while laying flat in bed. This worked fine.. It worked even better when I had the local glass company make a black glass shelf for it.
Here we have another build a figure series from Marvel Legends. The Falcon can fly and has an empathic link with his pet Falcon. That's about it. But that's all you need to be a one time Avenger apparently.That said though, he does make a good action figure. For one his colorful outfit and winged arms make him pretty visually appealing and fun to pose. His sculpt is all around pretty good although he has some funky shoulder joints. He's made to be a bit thinner and more wiry than someone like Luke Cage which fits his character well. There is little to no slop on the paint and great articulation. He even comes with an accessory. He has his pet falcon that can connect to his back via a clear plastic piece to appear to be flying over his shoulder.He comes with his comic, the back of the package doubles as a back drop and the gross and fat belly of Mojo. Mojo himself is a mix of good and bad. The paint and sculpt on his body is great with spot on skin tones and the electronics coming out of his head look great. His spider base, however, is very plain and lacks much of the detail you'll see pictured on the back of the package and has a very bland and featureless paint job. It also lacks any real articulation other than the legs being able to turn right where they connect to the base. Maybe this was to help it stand better, but here's the rub... Only four of the six legs are actually designed to touch the floor and due to their thin spidery nature they begin to bend under Mojo's excessive flab. I'm sure some ingenuity on my part can correct the problem, but we really shouldn't have to fix new figures now should we. It's a mixed bag on the Mojo.
I checked out this book to see what all the fuss was about. Of course I knew that conservative du jour Ann Coulter was trying to attack the Democratic party with every shred of evidence she could find. She supports the Bush administration with no clear thought of reality. THERE ARE NO WEAPONS IN IRAQ, ANN! If the Republicans are so good, I'm wondering why they aren't focusing more on strengthening security on our borders instead of spending that money on attacking other nations for their oil (IE: Dick Cheyney's former VP of Halliburton). Ann is once again in denial about her own party and failed to recognize the current Administration blurring of Church and State, and all the crimes that have been committed under Republican Presidents (can you say... watergate?). It is true that Democrats have their flaws, but this book is way too biased on her part and should be shelved in the "Brainwash" section. Maybe Ann should wake up and smell the coffee... and find out who's been brewing up all these lies- HERSELF. Find something less biased with at leased some sense of reality.
It's been almost 15 years since I last saw The Exorcist and my overriding memory was that I slept with all the lights on for four days. This adaptation of William Peter Blatty's novel is nothing short of stunning and shows that multiu-million dollar special effects are still no match for old fashioned storytelling. There are no computer-generated special effects here, although at the time of it's release the movie proved to be a real special effectds event. Put simply there's no equal and posssible never will be for this movie. It's sharp, forboding and builds an amazing sense of fear within the viewer as the story of a little girl's possession by an evil sprit is played out over roughly 80 or 90 minutes. If you only ever watch one horror movie in your life make it this one - the rest are limp by comparison... END
After trying dozens of toasters and toaster ovens and finding all of them wanting... I decided to try something different and bought this... It is the FASTEST, EASIEST to use & clean, & does THE BEST TOAST most consistentaly of any machine I've used. The bulbs heat with less power draw than the coils of the older toasters, and they work faster! Re-heating pizza, queseqillas and other pastries is speedy with super results....
I bought this frame for my office after I had given the wooden model frame to my wife for Christmas. Both are really nice and easy to use. I like the ability to have the frame turn itself on and off at a predetermined times. Not only does it save power, but it also is a great reminder that I have spent enough time at the office and it is now time to go home! The picture is bright and the OS/Interface is not that hard to use once you are used to it. About a 10 minute learning curve. We have had no problems and give this frame an unqualified recommendation. The only thing I could possibly be unhappy about is Amazon's "dynamic" pricing policy. When I bought the frame for my wife it was $150 with free shipping in December, my frame was $190 plus shipping in January and as I write this it is back at $150 with free shipping.
I just finished reading this book which took just a few hours. I started on Dr. I's nitric oxide program before receiving the book from Amazon, and I was happy with my results for such a short period of time. After reading the book I realized that I wasn't following the full program.I'm glad I bought the book. I've now upgraded to the full program and I feel even better. I believe the NO program will revolutionize the heart health care industry in this country. Some simple supplements that you can buy anywhere and minimal exercise can turn your body into an artery-cleaning machine !! My BP is lower and I have a lot more energy than previously and it's only been a week or two.Great program-great book !
This is a wonderful minty, fresh and reasonably strong cologne from Dolce and Gabbana. Their signature scent, I suppose, and remarkably fine! It is one of my personal favorites, and balances citrus with floral/herb notes very well. This is a reasonably formal cologne, and superb for a night's out, though I would think too sporty for the office, in my opinion. One of the best of it's class.
I am a huge fan of this show as well as of Stephen Schwartz. I bought this book because I wanted the libretto of the musical. Everything I read before I ordered the book stated that it would contain the libretto. It does not. It contains the story to Wicked with large excerpts from the Holzman's book as well as the lyrics, but not the complete dialogue. Large portions of the script are reduced to a short descriptive paragraph. This book is not cheap, but I paid the price because I wanted the complete libretto. I feel like I was mislead.
They shared a magical past. Could the future be theirs as well?Childhood friends and playmates, Kent Coleman Landover and Anna Delaney played for hours as "K.C. Cowboy and the Countess." But they were separated as young children and lived their separate lives apart. But Anna had followed the meteoric rise to fame and power that Kent had traveled. And she loved him still, deep in her heart where the childhood fantasies still frolicked.An accident left Kent Landover with bumps, bruises, and amnesia. He couldn't remember his corporate successes and his fiancee who would be joined to him as little more as a business merger. All he could remember was Anna - his Countess. And now, with those memories of Anna, he strikes out to find her, determined to make her his for life.While Kent's business hangs in the balance, he sells his L.A. home and buys a ranch, taking Anna with him. Together as K.C. Cowboy and Anna, his Countess, they will run the Rocking Horse Ranch. But as Anna begins to succumb to the illusion, her head tells her heart it's just a matter of time until Kent's memory returns, and he as a hotshot corporate success story will want nothing more to do with her. But isn't it possible that the future could hold promise for Kent and Anna? After all, fairy tales do come true. Don't they?Ms. Scalera has written a novel of pure, heart-rending magic in "THE COWBOY AND THE COUNTESS." With delightfully evolved characters and an engaging storyline, you'll cheer for Anna and K.C. You can't go wrong with Ms. Scalera's latest offering from Harlequin American, so don't pass this one up!
This was an album full of struggle and hardship but was actually brought out in a harmonious manner. it was a n original mix of tough lyrics thrown over some instrumentals that had melody to them. It was very unique in the way it was not the traditional &quot;No Limit, this CD was thrown together in two weeks and it shows&quot; type of album. I'm glad he went off to C-Loc Records. Big Ups to the man holding it down for Baton Rouge.
Very good silky quality, heavyweight cotton, fit and shape is good for the age (24m size). Came through the wash well and stains come out easily. My only criticism is that the neck is very loose and stretchy so if your kid is going through the undressing stage (like mine), they can wriggle out of them from the top down too easily.
Length:: 0:53 MinsI just put this thing together yesterday and am very pleased with how it turned out. We have a small kitchen in the apartment we are in, so this was a perfect solution to add more storage and surface space.The individual pieces did not seem to fit quite as well together as other furniture I have put together (even cheap furniture from IKEA), but not to the degree to prevent assembly or create noticeable seems. The top drawer slides in and out fairly easily, but I could imagine it being a little tougher if heavy objects were in there due to the fact that there are no metal sliders with ball bearings. The drawer just slides along flanges of wood on each side. To me, these minor issues are out-weighed by the price. I did quit a bit of shopping around, and this was one of the cheapest options I could find.While most of this review focused on a couple of minor negative things that people may want to think about so that they are not surprised, we area very happy with this product.
This was the best Christmas movie i have ever seen. It is great for kids of all ages. I saw it when i was little and I loved it and 10 years later I still love it. The special effects and great you can not tell that he did not gain 45 pounds. The acting was great from Allen and Reinhold. It was a little stale from Crewson and Loyd. The movie is a short 90 minutes and it is about a divorced dad who accidentally kills santa and puts on the suit and delivers the rest of the gifts. Little does he know now he is santa. Withen the next year he grows a large santa sized pot-belly and a white beard. Which is great to watch. He then has his son taken away from him because his son thinks he Santa.It has a predictable ending but all around a great movie.
I bought this DVD expecting to see some of my favorite episodes, and yes some of the episodes are uncut. But overall the picture quality is terrible, additionally one of my favorite episodes (the one with the English Butler) is missing 5 critical minutes of he episode where the butler talks about how he likes staying with Andy and Opie, but overhears Andy and Barney talking on the porch that night. The scene obviously is missing when the butler just disappears right in the middle of the episode.Watch TV land instead, and you'll get a better quality result.
Metallica's debut album, heavily influenced by former bandmate Dave Mustaine, began the band's domination and influence in the heavy metal genre. There was something different about them from the beginning, they came across with a sincerity and passion to be the best and avoid the cheesy pitfalls that befell other bands that played similar music. The album immediately gets in your face with "Hit the Lights" and then "The Four Horsemen" which is an upgrade, especially lyrically to Mustaine's "Mechanix". The only drawback in the song is the extra section added to differentiate itself from Mustaine's version which they never play live anyway. "Motorhead" is another exciting song, and then "Jump in the Fire" which kicks ass and the lyrics are an improvement to what you can hear in demo versions. Cliff Burton's solo comes next - he was one of the best bass players ever. "Whiplash" is another iconic song. "Phantom Lord" is awesome. "No Remorse" to me is straight filler; the band obviously wanted to save some of their other songs for "Ride the Lightning" and I think "No Remorse" is kind of cheesy and repetitive. "Seek and Destroy" is another classic. "Metal Militia" is the only weak song that Mustaine co-wrote; it's another somewhat filler song that ends an otherwise solid debut album. It's also well documented, particularly in "Cliff 'em All", that the band wanted to call the album "Metal Up Your Ass". I don't think the toilet bowl with a hand holding a knife sticking out of the bowl would have been as effective as the cover they ended up with.
I recently re-discovered Edmund Crispin and downloaded four of his works. They were all good reads: crisp, clever and to the point. This one was so bad I deleted it after a couple of chapters. It's arch and pretentious. The characters are tediously eccentric and wholly unbelievable. There's a repulsive sub-plot about cruelty to animals.It was a most unfortunate end to an admirable writing career.
Around pp. 165-167, in the essay "The Carrier Bag Theory of Fiction," LeGuin discusses the possibility that the first human invention was not the weapon, but the container -- the sling, the sack, the bag, the carrier. (I remembered it as "the vessel," but that term doesn't appear in the book.) What good is generating a lot of stuff to eat if you don't have any way to get it back to camp? She argues the point persuasively and passionately.I read this book in 1991 or 1992, nearly 20 years ago. I've not seen the idea anywhere else (although she cites an anthropologist writing in 1975) but it has shaped my perception since. Not to diminish the rest of the book, but this single idea in this one essay is, I believe, worth getting the whole book for.
I'll get the nit out of the way: I found Stewart's narration a little annoying. His voice had a note of smugness in it that grated on my ears. BUT...The story is undeniably compelling and dramatic, the underwater photography as stunning as anything you'll see in "Blue Planet," and everything is in service of a crucial ecological cause. Ever since the late Steven Erwin hit the scene with his "Crocodile Hunter" persona, nature films have seemed to go out of their way to exclaim that this or that large and scary animal is "beautiful" or "gorgeous," or by crikey, in some way less frightening than it really is for being, in fact, magnificent. I see no contradiction. Sharks are in fact essential to the health of the oceans, and they occupy a vital niche in the world's most important ecosystems. 'Nuff said, frankly. No effort to convince me that most sharks are handsome or cuddly is going to work. But it is impossible not to admire how supremely they have become adapted to their environment, over eons of deep time. That honing is evident in the grace of some, the unique features of others, and the range and success of many. All of which is now threatened by the species that fancies itself intelligent. The blind forces of evolution have produced an astonishing creature that the ruthless intellect of humans now threatens to extinguish. Stewart captures the obscenity and injustice of this state of affairs very powerfully in "Sharkwater," making it one of few must-see documentaries.
The editorial folks may not think much of this book, but my kids absolutely loved it. My 2 year old stayed (more or less) in tune for the pictures, my 4 year old was completely engrossed in the story, and my 5 year old daughter began to cry when the duckling was so berated he had to run away. We could only continue when I reminded her the story wasn't over, and it might turn out OK. And in the end, she was thrilled.Our family believes as CS Lewis did: "A children's story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children's story." In that vein, the Ugly Duckling is a book I will happily read to my kids anytime -- because I like it. Know what you're buying though. This is not some cutesy Disney book with a Donald-duckling in it. It is dark; it is scary; it is completely true to the original story... and it is beautiful. If you liked Mayer'sBeauty and the Beast, you will like her Ugly Duckling. And visa-versa, Mayer's Beauty is a stunning retelling as well.One warning, I think the age bracket listed is off for this book. Age 9-12 is too high, this is more appropriate as a read-aloud for ages 5-8, and as a self-read up to about age 10.
I don't usually like "dark" fiction, but this didn't bother me because the 4 main characters were such essentially likeable people (and because I had a feeling they'd be victorious in the end). I thought this was a great creative concept and a pretty good execution. My only complaint was with the last few chapters -- not the plot, which I thought was just right, but the writing. It just seemed to get flat and a little awkward, as if Nix had used all his writing skills on the exposition and then just wanted to get the grand finale over with. I also thought Shade's "personality integration" problems were a little clumsily handled. My other frustration is that we only learn in very vague terms who the Overlords are and how they pulled off their whole sick scheme. However, perhaps this is appropriate for a book told from the perspective of "children" (actually teenagers) -- their main concern is to turn back the Change, not to understand it. On the whole, an intriguing and touching book.
TIMELESS story that everyone should own or at least see. can never be replicated or forgotten. The characters are wonderful and it is great for men and women alike.
As someone who graduated from a high school where people attended football games just for the half time show, and has attended several marching band competitions, I was looking forward to seeing Drumline. I was majorly disappointed. The storyline and acting in this movie are painfully bad. The main character, Devon, is too annoying for words. The band directors of the dueling universities that make up this story are ridiculously melo dramatic. I know we can expect movies to stretch reality, but to show the main character begin school at one university, drop out and transfer to another university, and then return to the first university... all in one semester was absurd. Have the writers of this movie ever attended college? Have they ever MET anyone who has?I am no expert on drumlines so I cannot judge the authenticity of the musical sequences. I enjoyed them. I would have enjoyed the musical sequences more if they did not include a ludicrous number of close ups of the dance squads that accompany the bands performances. Their ridiculously tight, not to mention sparse costumes coupled with them writhing on the field left me with the impression that the dance squads in this movie looked more like they should have been pole dancing in a cheap strip dive, rather than performing as part of a marching band.I would not reccommend purchasing this movie. It is not worth the money. If you feel you must see it, I would rent it, pull up the main menu, and go straight to the scenes with the band performances. The performance that's played with the closing credits is entertaining as well. The rest is a waste of time.
In this 300+ page book, the author tells us his 8 "secrets". The problem is that those 8 "secrets" only take about 40 pages, the rest is fluff, notes on his interviews with clients, clients' opinions and experiences. This "book" looks like the transcripts of a marketing focus group. The author also has the irritating habit of promoting his other book about once every 2 pages. You can only read about 5 pages at a time before being totally turned off by the excessive self-promotion. A diarrhea of words with a constipation of thought. Leave this PoS on the shelf!!!!! I returned my copy for a refund!!!!
This is no Disney film, that's for sure. (BTW, I'm not a fan of Disney films). When the movie began, I was enchanted by the beauty of the scenes. Then I became comfused. Because I've traveled a lot, I recognized some places, but the scenes shifted without rhyme or reason, moving from continent to continent with no transition or explanation. I would have liked some narration (as in "Winged Migration"). The scenes soon went from breathtaking to grim. There was endless footage of thousands of fluffy yellow chicks whisked along on conveyor belts, down chutes, into bins, etc. A few minutes would have been plenty to demonstrate the cruelty. One segment focused on the torsos of prepubertal indigenous girls adorned with extravagant beadwork on their shoulders but nothing below. Their vaginal clefts were clearly visible. I found this invasive and offensive, as I could see no point. While there may be a powerful social message in this DVD, the content was chaotic and the message delivered with a hammer striking everywhere at once.This film is not for the fainthearted. I certainly wouldn't want a child to watch it.
I love Ellis Peters' Brother Cadfael mystery books, and really enjoy most of this Brother Cadfael TV series. I thought this one was a very good one. It is true to the book and captures the same feeling of time and place. There is also that same sense that even though cruel and unfair things happen, there is goodness and right that will work to balance the scales.
Free is always good.if i buy tablet-pc, I will read e-book.everybody good luck.and thx amazon.I love it.
Like other reviewers, I will agree that this unit will not make your knives razor sharp. It will however make them very sharp and it's convenient enough and easy enough to use that you should run your favorite knives through it once a week or more.Just remember to warn other people that use your kitchen about how sharp the knives are after you use this device! It's very easy to have a HUGE difference in sharpness after using it, and if you have people used to dull knives they might cut themselves because they habitually put too much pressure on a dull knife when cutting through food.The first stage you'll most likely only use once or twice per knife, as it's a coarse grinding stone that's designed to bring life back to very dull knives. Second stage is basically a non-powered honing steel, third stage is the fine grind sharpener that you'll be using most of the time. Weird that the steel is in the second slot, as that is usually the third thing you do when sharpening a knife.The instructions are a bit misleading, because there are two separate sections telling you when to use the first station (but skipping the other 2 stations), and then another area telling you to basically never use it. Kind of confusing, but the basic process is to use the first station once per dull knife when you get it out of the box, then for daily/weekly use the third station and then hone it with the second station.It does sharpen serrated bread knives, but it only sharpens the "tips" of the serrations. I haven't noticed a huge diference in cutting through bread with my "freshly" sharpened serrated knives.Also note that if you have a $30 set of those cheap-o micro-serrated "eversharp" stamped kitchen knives this sharpener won't be much use to you, Spend the money on 2 or 3 decent kitchen knives instead, and then get this item after a few months of use to keep them super sharp.
I have bothersome joints, so being able to get a great workout without the swollen joints is a godsend! I really like Ms. Sansone's enthusiasm, and how easy it is to jump right into the exercises.
Ok, lefties, get ready to pound the 'not helpful' button, because you're not going to like this review.The first thing I recommend when opening up one of these expose books is going right to the back and checking the sources. If almost every source is a columnist in a newspaper or a left-wing pundit, you're probably not going to be getting a clear look at the issues.Amy's assertions about the motives for the current war in Iraq are wrong. Amy's use of statistics would be flayed by any college freshman. Amy's leaps of logic are more appropriate for a circus than for a bookshelf.Some examples: Amy cites a report by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting which states that 61% of surveyed Americans were in favor of more time for diplomacy. She goes on to assume that because 61% favored more time for talks, they were also involved in anti-war activism. One example of many.Next - Amy cites a German newspaper reporter claiming to have information from the Iraqi weapons report that was redacted by the US. From this one guy's assertions, she bases her whole argument that the US sold nuclear material to Saddam. Does anybody else want more sources (and more informed sources) than one German reporter?There is almost no source cited who does not have a political motivation. There is almost no assertion made that is sensible in the context of the world today.Amy does not seem to realize that Islamofascists, whatever their origins, will not stop trying to destroy America if we try really hard to be nice to them. She decries the calamity in East Timor, but has nothing to say of atrocities under the Mullahs in Iran. The same leftists who are horrified by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan turned away from the slaughter of 100,000 after the fall of Saigon or Pol Pot's genocide's in Cambodia. They quote Mao religiously (Amy quotes Mao in Chapter 1, as a matter of fact) without any regard to the suppression of democracy and the death of millions of innocents in China. The double standard is really sickening.Long review short - DON'T expect journalism from this book. Don't expect facts. And if you're one of those who digs conspiricy theory, make a double-thick tinfoil hat so the Haliburton satellites can't read your thoughts.
In a very a parallel way, Sister Wives, a current reality show about a polygamous family presents us with a family who choose to live their lives in the open. Unlike the Hendrickson's however, the patriarch of the family did not run for public office nor have a business that depends on public support.This final season of Big Love was much better than the cartoonish and improbable episodes from Season 4. It takes a very dramatic turn towards the reality of their lives and there is no longer anything remotely humorous except dead on issues that can no longer be run away from. It's mostly about Senator Bill Hendrickson's refusal to put his religion in the closet. While he has noble intentions, the political, financial and emotional toll it takes on his family is overwhelming. This is also the season of self realization for all three wives, no longer able to do just what's best for their family but to meet their own individual spiritual, emotional and intellectual growth that can no longer be suppressed.Like many, I sure am sorry this wonderful series has concluded. I can only hope and pray that one day, maybe we'll see Big Love, the Movie (which I'd much rather see than another Sex in the City installment). Big Love you will truly be missed!
I purchased this DVD at a national chain store in 2008 for nostalgic reasons. It didn't disappoint (except for the sound glitch during "Killed by Death"; I returned it but the new DVD had the exact same glitch so it's likely in the entire pressing). The energy is great and the execution flawless. If you are a Motorhead fan, you will enjoy this!
First recommendation of Alan Durning: read the book in a bus. Last recomendation: give the book to the person next to you in the same bus. He has reflexion not only about transportation but also for urban planning, and how to avoid policies that in a middle term affect your transportation.
I'm not a usual mystery reader -- but as a librarian in a small town in Northeast Iowa I read his books to expand my horizons and invited him to speak at our library. Harstad won me over. Something the other reviewers didn't mention is his humor -- and the quirky personality in his stories. He represents our corner of Iowa in a way I haven't seen before (although the cases have been fictionalized they are taken from parts of incidents in his career and the atmosphere darkened -- he shows our part of the world to be surrounded by bluffs along the river and full of scrappy, hard-working and intelligent people ... and some strange people as well) People who visit are surprised how beautiful it is here (not at all what they expect from Iowa). Harstad lives here, worked here for over 20 years in the police department -- and when he writes about our landscape and our people he knows what he's talking about. Of course -- a novel focuses on the unusual (so don't think we're vampires) By the way -- the house in Code Sixty-One really exists and is only a block away from me. Sny Magill is a real place too. Enjoyable, personable mystery.
No other pop diva has gone this far! Christina shows her maturity and versatility on this album. I can listen to this album from START to finish (except for &quot;Make Over&quot; of course). This album is deep and goes into MANY moods. Christina's smokey voice melts over each track like butter (except for &quot;Make Over of course). Sorry for the clich&eacute;'s, but this is one of the bests in my album collection. Kudos to Xtina for a job WELL DONE!TOP THAT BRITNEY!
This is indeed the superior history of the Battle of New Orleans and is especially valuable for the analysis of thepolitical stakes. In short, the British had every intention of adding this city to their collection of overseas naval bases (whicheventually included Gibraltar, Capetown, Hong Kong and a failedattempt at Toulon) and had worded the peace treaty to permit this, had they succeeded in its capture. The modern claim that the battle was meaningless because it took place in the month after the signing of the treaty, is not correct.
If you failed grade school, this may be for you. STAY AWAY. I would be interested to see who took such a great theme and butch it. Shame on the makers of this movie. 'Seems to be consistent with Asylum films. We rented it, watched about 10-15 minutes, replaced it with I Love Lucy, and asked for our $1.00 back. Though typical for todays rude, and obnoxious movie making, we hope the New Line Home Video version will be better. I gave it one star, only to be able to write this review.
This was my first Halo and if you are not a fan you may feel like an outsider when speaking to a fan about this game. Truth be told this is a very good FPS even if your not a fan because lets face it a good FPS gives the player the opportunity to shoot stuff and enemies and Halo 3 give you just that. In general this is a solid fun game. But depending if you are a fan or not you may consider this game to be a bit overrated.
I like the retractable cord and nonstick pot. It replaced a 10+ year old rice cooker, so it's a huge improvement. So much easier to clean and far more attractive.
I love this book!! It is full of stories that people sent Don about their experiences. Oh My Goodness, I laughed so hard I cried!! And then I started dumping junk FAST!! I didn't want my mother to read my high school diary or know that I kept broken tongue depressors from childhood imunizations!!If the normal &quot;dump your junk&quot; books just don't work for you, try this one!! It will entertain and scare you into getting rid of the junk in you life.
I loved the film, the cinematography, and the music score. But I think it is not as a heavy weight as the original Wall Street film in the realm of ideas. But in the world we are living today, a cautionary tale about dangers of moneymaking on insider information is no longer valid. Today, a spread of the global communications, rise of derivative instruments - futures, options, and swaps - made it a mundane thing for the investment banks and hedge funds to gamble on information. That's why the Stone's sequel isn't about using insider information; rather it's about using disinformation and profiting from it.The first film was a film of ideas: it was an age-old story of Faust retold. The Wall Street Mephistopheles, the Grand Seducer by name Gordon Gekko made young trader Bud Fox (played by Charlie Sheen during his more coherent years) do immoral things for profit and for the sake of power. Fox paid the price (imprisonment), and in the end he redeemed himself. The villain's darkness helped to illuminate the important things that had been obscure to Bud Fox in the beginning.This sequel, while still good and filmed with quirky zoom-in and zoom-out camera, nevertheless doesn't position itself as a Foust-like tragedy. As a critique of the American capitalism, it is tongue-in-cheek. The Brolin's character (CEO of the evil investment bank Churchill Schwartz, a veiled portrait of Goldman Sachs) is not a real villain. He is like George W. Bush (Brolin's previous role) - firm, combative, but insecure, one-sided and vengeful. Also, there is no Gretchen he can offer. Brolin isn't a villain of the Gekko a la 1987 caliber. Where is the villain? It is not Brolin, not aging Gekko 2010, not Churchill Schwartz, not even capitalist system per se.I think the real villain is missing - what Stone wanted but failed to flesh out is a deformed capitalism which has so far captured the U.S. - a laissez faire-ish financial capitalism based on ideas of neo-liberal Chicago-school economics. It was sold to the American ruling class who thought that the progressive social agenda could be piggybacked to the deregulated markets espoused by that type of capitalism. Obama has changed nothing - his economic policies are being shaped by the same people - many of them with close links to Wall Street (like Tim Geithner, N.Y. Fed President at a time - also a personage in the film). These people helped to dismantled Roosevelt's curbs on the banking system during the Clinton era. In the end, Stone shouldn't lament that the American politics have been captured by a financial oligarchy. After all, why we would be watching his movies if this weren't the case?As for me, I think the situation is far more radical and we all are already living in the simulated world of dystopian Matrix, a simulacra, surrounded by a digital rain of symbols and signs, meaningless, but all-pervasive. If this is what Stone wanted to show - I think we may have seen some glimpses of that in the film.
Pros: Well, it IS a bike (thus two stars rather than one). It has two wheels, pedals, handlebars, and something to sit on. I have no doubt that an individual could ride it - eventually. Then again...Cons: I will begin with the obvious. This bike does not - I repeat, DOES NOT - come equipped with SRAM MRX Pro twist shifters, as is CLEARLY stated in the item description. In fact, the bike I received was equipped with VERY cheap Shimano EZ-Fire trigger shifters. This is important because my decision to invest in this bike was based upon two factors: it is relatively inexpensive as compared to other front-suspension 26" men's mountain bikes; and it was supposed to be equipped with twist shifters. My intent is to use this bike for commuting during the winter in upstate NY. As you might guess, it gets VERY cold here, and I will require fairly heavy mittens to avoid frostbite. Trigger shifters don't work so well with heavy mittens.Now on to the rest...The first indication of the low quality of this bike is the rear skewer. It does NOT have a quick release skewer on the real wheel, an immediate and obvious indication of low quality in a bicycle.The rear tire is factory mounted on the rim backwards - meaning that the deep lug off-road treads are facing in the incorrect direction for maximum traction.The handlebars seem to be of a non-standard diameter over much of their length. The only 'standard' is where they are clamped into the stem. There is a section of about two inches width in the direct center of the bars that is a standard 25.4mm diameter so that they can be clamped in place. This section tapers to a smaller diameter on each side of the center section; however, the tapers are not spaced equally on each side. The overall effect of this is that (1) if you intend to attach an accessory item, such as a light, bell, or other safety equipment, the standard sized clamp that is supplied with your accessory will NOT fit correctly on these handlebars; and (2) any item, such as the mounting bracket for my Topeak Tour Guide handlebar bag, that is supposed to be mounted and CENTERED on the front of the handlebars cannot POSSIBLY be centered because the dissimilar tapers push the mounting clamps to one side or the other of center.The shifters appear to be plastic junk. Not only that, they appear to be permanently attached to the brake levers rather than separate, so that if you choose to replace the shifters with the SRAMs that were SUPPOSED to come with the bike, you also have to buy replacement brake levers. BTW, the SRAM MRX Pros aren't available in the U.S. - if you want 'em, you have to buy 'em from England!The saddle is the most uncomfortable piece of trash I've encountered on a bike.Ditto for the handlebar grips. They're simply horrible.Additional thoughts: Getting right to the point, this bike is yet another cheaply manufactured made-in-China piece of trash. Basically this is an $80 bike with a $200 price tag because it includes a water bottle and cage, an aluminum frame, and a kick-stand. To be honest, it is quite light - altogether only about twice the weight of one of my loaded panniers. The water bottle is cheap and is simply a waste in the winter of upstate NY; and the cage itself is again very cheaply made and does NOT lock the bottle in - one good bump and the bottle will pop out and be gone. And how well the kick stand (and the aluminum frame it is attached to) hold up has yet to be determined. In general the kick stand will not be used with my panniers attached, since the higher center of gravity will then cause the bike to fall over anyway. Based upon the poor quality I've encountered so far, I doubt this bike will make it through one complete season without a major overhaul of the bottom bracket, rear axle, or front suspension - and more likely all three!The bottom line: In order to make this bike work for my purposes, and GET THE COMPONENTS that I was SUPPOSED to get on it, I will likely have to spend half as much as the bike cost. If you're looking for a relatively inexpensive beater that is unlikely to attract the attention of thieves due to it's low quality, this is the one for you. If you're looking for a good commuter that will last, keep looking. And don't even THINK of taking this thing off-road - you will undoubtedly end up carrying it home on your back.
Since I was a small boy, I've been fascinated by the Arthurian legend. In recent years, I've become acutely aware of the Christian underpinnings of the legend. I've also come to realize that historic Christianity is unabashedly monarchist (Christ is, after all, 'King of Kings', not 'First Citizen of all Republics', and St. Peter refers to Christians as 'a Royal Priesthood'). This book rolls all that into one. It is the book that I've waited 35 years to read, and I did it in less than 24 hours. It's that good. My wife, who never reads novels, loved it.Interestingly, since reading it, I noticed a news story about a minor scandal involving one of the British Royals, and the response of one PM, calling for the abolition of the Monarchy, could easily have been lifted from the pages of 'Avalon'.Buy it. Buy the other books in Lawhead's Pendragon Cycle('Taliesin', 'Merlin', 'Arthur', 'Pendragon', 'Grail').Let the Kingdom of Summer begin!
All-in-all, an excellent book, well-written, snappy dialogue, well-rounded characters whose motivations make sense. This is the first book in the series that I've read, so I came to it with no preconceptions. A number of other reviewers seem to feel disappointed that so much time was spent on the relationships, but a book whose people aren't people is always a bore in the end. The relationships are what made the book work. I will admit to some disappointment at Anita's choice of Jean-Claude over Richard. For one thing, Jean-Claude has gotten every woman he ever wanted for over two hundred years, and he's obviously wanted plenty. He doesn't deserve this one. Richard is not a wimp because he prefers peace, light and harmony to bloodlust and murder. He loses Anita (if he's lost her) because he did exactly what she wanted him to do. He faced his enemy, killed him and then dealt with the consequences of that decision. Anita is the one who couldn't face those consequences. In this context, her choice of Jean-Claude was an act of cowardice. She wasn't running to Jean-Claude, she was running from herself. Nevertheless, a very good book. Considering what happened here, I'm not going to read the earlier ones, since I know how it all turns out, but I will certainly tune in for the next one.
In my opinion the best documentary about WWI even though lacking the color and the testimonies ofWorld War 1 in Color. All political and military aspects of the conflict are carefully analyzed, as well as their roots and their consequences into WWII and even into relatively recent times.
This book is at once heartwarming and heartbreaking. I read this book when it was first published and it is still my favorite book to this day. A truly wonderful read!
The songs are great. No question about it. However, I happened to be sitting next to the right speaker of my stereo system when Immigrant Song began and I noticed the sound from the right speaker sounded a bit choppy. At first I thought the problem was with the balance control on my receiver, but I then played the CD on my PC and noticed the same problem. (Has anyone else noticed this on their CD?) I checked Atlantic Record's web site for an email address to ask if this was a known problem or if it could just be my CD. While on Atlantic's site I noticed that the art work for "Led Zeppelin Remasters" did not match the artwork on the "Led Zeppelin Remasters" sold on Amazon. The order of the songs is also different. Furthermore, the album on the Atlantic site that has the same artwork as the "Led Zeppelin Remasters" sold on Amazon is a 4-CD set, not a 2-CD set. Apparently they package the CDs differently in different countries. Maybe I'm just biased/suspicous, but I sort of suspect the sound quality problem might be due to the fact that the CD is an import. I could be wrong about that, but... I think the next time I purchase CDs on Amazon I will avoid ones listed as "Import". I could be wrong about that
I've got a secret. This book is not really about Galileo's daughter, Virginia. It is about Galileo and his life and times as seen through letters from his daughter to him (the letters from him to his daughter were destroyed). As a book about Virginia, it is largely uninteresting and unenlightening. As a book about Galileo, it is terrific. Dava Sobel captures the essence of Galileo's work and his fight with the religious authorities. My emotions as I read the book were: enlightenment in that it shows Galileo to be a far better person than I had given him credit for; sadness because of how he was mistreated; amazement for the honor he showed in all his dealings; and frustration at how much science was held back by religious authorities. And it puts into perspective how little my own daughter actually demands from me. I strongly recommend this book and I look forward to reading other of Sobel's works, including Longitude.
I travel back to the '80s in a time machine. Parking it behind some bushes, I wander onto my old college campus in Vermont. There I encounter a group of my college buddies. They stare at me wonderingly, noting my resemblance to my younger self. Remembering a scene inBack to the Future Part II, I say that I am my own father. Then I say that I have a rare power - the power to tell the future. They smile at me, a crazy middle-aged man, indulgently. There are about five of them, all college kids who listen to alternative music. I know them well, each one of them, but - after thirty years - I'm startled by their appearance. They ask me some questions about the future. For instance: what is the political scene like?I know they are all familiar with ABC's 20/20 (on the air since 1978). I tell them that in the future this show has an anchorman called John Stossel. He tends to criticize the government.They playfully react: "Wow! The future rocks!"After all, they live in a time when the media steadfastly refuses to criticize our elderly president, known lovingly as "The Great Communicator." There are rumors that the government plans to censor rock music, or at least label it. And our "Teflon" president has ties to the Moral Majority, a religious group which condemns all manner of sexual and social freedom. He is promoting a "Just Say No" campaign against drugs which exaggerates the dangers of recreational drug use. There can be no doubt in my friends' minds that the government is pure evil.Not just the government - these are desperate times in general. Most young people live in some degree of fear of nuclear annihilation at the hands of the Soviet Union. We don't support the escalating arms race, because we foresee that it will only worsen geopolitical tensions. While there are some who support leftist rebels in Latin America, most would not go so far as to defend communism. We know that, as Americans, we enjoy more personal liberties than Soviet citizens do. With our crazy hairstyles, our creative sexual practices, and our flirtations with male and female androgyny - and recreational drug use, we enjoy this freedom to the fullest. It is our moralizing government that threatens to end the party.I tell them that this journalist on 20/20 is wildly unpopular due to his anti-government stance. Upon hearing this, they roll their eyes. Typical. Republicans won't tolerate criticism of the government. Even now, there are rumors that the Reagan administration is practicing unconstitutional surveillance of private citizens to identify youthful rebels who dare to criticize the government. It's just like that popular song: "Every Breath You Take." It's really about surveillance; we know this. Some of my friends claim that the FBI is taping their phone conversations; they can hear the tell-tale clicks when they're talking on their phones at home. My friends are exaggerating, of course - trying to appear cool.No, I tell them. This guy, Stossel, gets the most criticism from the liberals of the future. My friends stare at me in confusion. Their "A Flock of Seagulls" hair-dos are ruffled. The earrings on their left ears (never the right!) catch the light as they wait for an explanation.I clear my throat. "The liberals of the future have a problem with people criticizing the government." They just stare at me uncomprehendingly.
all but one of the nozzles leak...the sugar water that leaks on the deck then attracts ants
Prepare to be disturbed by this book...by the Other Mother, among many other twisted characters and ideas. Coraline goes into an alternate plane as visceral and strange as Baum's Oz or Carroll's Wonderland. The underlying whispers and ominous sentience are scary enough as Coraline bravely traverses this new place, so oddly similar to her own world.But the visuals...if I had been under 10 and read this book, I surely would have had nightmares for weeks. Your imagination will prove quite potent while you read this.The art is great too...a bonus and quite representative of the feel of the story.Highly recommended.
In "An Olympic Death," private detective Pepe Carvalho is mourning the changes in his life due to his own aging and the changes coming to his beloved city of Barcelona because of the coming 1992 summer Olympics (the city is in the process of getting a major facelift for the games). It sounds like it could be a mystery with some deeper themes, but in reality it is just more of Pepe Carvalho slogging through the seamy parts of Barcelona and meeting with the decadent people who inhabit them. His clients in this book also are people with few morals and no redeeming aspects.Unlike some of his previous books, this book does not pound home the author's political views, which might be good in some ways but just leaves us with an aging sensualist protagonist longing to be young and virile again. Pepe is exposed as selfish, self indulgent, self centered, self everything--though that may not be the author's intention.I must say that Montalban has a way of making even the weak plots in this book somewhat interesting, and so the book was not a total loss. The parts about Pepe's love of gourmet food are always tactilely satisfying also. However, I cannot recommend this book because it is really just about a lot of immoral people doing their thing.
I think MA have spent too much time reading the papers. This is one of the most depressing, grim, lachrymose CDs I have yet heard. Listening to this in the car CD player on the way to work is the best possible way to get unmotivated to do any work - particularly in the depressing Bay Area economy. Navel-gazing at its worst. Very Goth, very dark, and just a bit too much in general. Verging on monotonous. DO NOT listen to this if you're out of work or mourning a relationship. In fact, even if you're in a cheerful mood, this disc will fix that good and proper. Good production, good atmospherics. The musicians on this disc just really need to get away for a vacation in a sunny place and drink lots of pina coladas. No wonder Sinead's retiring after cutting this CD.
Remember watching this movie on the Disney channel and loving it? That's why I had to buy it. It reminds me of being a kid and loving this movie. It's so funny and cute.
It's halloween. based on ancient Pagan holidays, it is harmless. Going from door to door collecting candy is not going to make your children worship the devil! Demons be gone!
This is the kind of book that is not for everybody, but I really liked it. It's the first book I've read by de Botton, and I love the dreamy, philosophical way that he writes. It's almost like listening to a good friend talk about things he values.The first half of the book is a sort of definition of status anxiety, why it exists and the different types of it that Botton sess. He details an interesting and eye-opening history of status. The second half of the book is about the ways that we cope with the anxiety, by using art, philosophy, and even living in a "bohemian" lifestyle.Botton writes in a tongue-in-cheek style, with lots of humor but also empathy and compassion for his fellow man. It's idiosyncratic and feels very personal. It's so hard to explain what I liked about it! I felt like I wanted to know him better as a person after reading the book, let's say that.The one thing I didn't like is that the book is illustrated, but the pictures are small and they are all in black and white. I do like that the pictures are included, though, because they seemed to be very personal choices for de Botton, almost randomly placed, that added to the quirky charm of it all.
I have twin boys and I would have loved not to have to go the cry route. I bought this book with that thought in mind - no crying. I swore up and down I would NEVER let them CIO. I tried to follow the book but with 2 babies - it didn't always work for us and actually my sons began to wake up even more often after trying to follow this plan.After much soul searching I decided to try one of the "other" methods and I now have 2 sleepers.I think that if you can take the time - weeks to get this in place - it is a great idea - our sleep deprivation was too severe by the time I got this book.
Good stuff to me.The beats are great even though 1 was from Cassidy's CD but still good stuff.
I actually bought these for my young children. They love making music and the "kid's" versions don't withstand their playing. These drums have been used daily for a year now. Sound is decent and the actual drum itself is incredibly durable. These drums have been through it all and are still in great condition.
This is a quick-reference companion for the spirit that has realized we are all messiahs when we accept ourselves as our ultimate truth. You open it at random and what you read, you need to hear. Note: You need to read illusions by Richard Bach, to appreciate it...or, at least Siddhartha and the bible.Maybe we're glad. Maybe we're sad. Or maybe we're mad. It works as well as any religious philosophy, without the hypocrisy, of course.Better answers than the mystic eight-ball, Pat Robertson, or a Papl Bull.
Meacham is the managing editor of "Newsweek" and has published other best-selling histories. This book examines the perennial question of how religion and politics, church and state, should interact and can interact.Meacham respects the Founding Fathers and argues they constructed a constitutional republic in which what Benjamin Franklin called "public religion" could and should operate. It's not private morality writ large, but it's an acknowledgement that a moral consensus is essential for free society. It also recognizes that government should protect and not intervene in religion even as religion must acknowledge a public domain for government wherein religion, or at least the church, need not insert itself.The book is well-researched but, surprisingly, somewhat unmoving to read. The writing does not flow and the stories are not compelling. It reads more like, well, a poorly constructed history text. Gven Meacham's credentials and his writing that I've enjoyed in other books, I found this surprising. Consequently, while there's some good content in this book, I'm not enthused about the book as a whole. So I don't really recommend it unless you are avidly interested in the topic.
Here's my review of this book, it's great. Now I would like to say that what is written in this book is quite possible and has been observed and experienced by people, namely myself.There is a small lake I like to walk around near where I live. It's just a short 2.5 mile single path loop. One day as I entered the path and began to walk I quickly overtook an elderly woman using a cane. She was hobbling along very slowly. I passed her at about the 1/4 mile mark. As I continued trucking along at a fast pace I soon came upon the 1 mile marker. Much to my surprise, ahead of me by about 50 yards was the same old woman with a cane! I overtook her again! Sounds impossible doesn't it? Either she teleported herself to the midway point on the path, or I was sucked into some kind of temporal time disortion loop or something, where I lost consciousness and re-emerged none the wiser. At any rate I have no idea how or what exactly happened, only that it did. I thank God for the experience, man. It was beautiful.Thanks God! (spoken while pointing both index fingers toward the heavens!)
I have had this device for two days, and have already burned DVD-R from TV shows, and VHS tapes. I haven't determined if I can go directly from VHS to DVD-R, without the HDD interim step, but will continue to explore. I did have one &quot;freeze up&quot; the first time I attempted to burn a DVD-R from HDD (had the program paused, and it wouldn't play, once I pressed record. Unplugged the unit and all worked well once I again plugged it in). Other than that, all has gone very well. I have been using only &quot;XP&quot; recording mode to get top picture quality, and it is just that, a TOP QUALITY picture, almost indistinguishable from the source. I have three Sony DVD players, and once I finalized the DVD-R created on the Panasonic, it played in the Sony players. Again with unbelievable picture and sound quality. I figure it will only get better as I continue to uncover new features. Although the manual isn't great, I'm not sure why other reviews blasted it. It's not that difficult to use. Best to use the index to locate what you're looking for, but, as far as I can tell, it's all in there...
I liked this book. The ongoing plot line of the Bloody Hand really captivated me and helped keep me interested. It's a decent step up from the older stuff from the original series.
This book continues the madcap adventures of Nick Twisp.In the beginning of this book, Nick and his girlfriend Sheeni, are happily living in a rented house after the success of Nick's invention. However, their respective sets of parents soon confiscate all the cash and this forces Nick to run away and plot his reunion with Sheeni, who is playing him the whole time like in the first book.Payne is a modern comedic genius. I place this book and its predecessor in the same class as John Kennedy Toole's Confederavy of Dunces. The pacing is manic and the action nonstop. Just when you think that it can't get any zanier, Payne pulls another trick out of his hat.This, and Youth In Revolt, are the funniest books I've read in my 23 years on this planet.
small and ugly looks betting in the pic its so small and ugly i didnt even put it in my tank waste of money
I'm an instructor for computer school where we teach Office at various levels - and even the most advanced students of mine really like this book.The examples are great and straight to the point, also - if you do not know how to do something - you can actually find under the procedures quickly and easily.On the downside - it does not have many expert topics as VBA (and not much for Macros) - but the topics it does cover are great. Even if you have used office for years - in this book you will find new COOL things you never knew about.Covers Word, Excel, Access and Powerpoint --> Tons of practice!!
I'm a big fan of 20th century ballet, especially Prokofiev and Stravinsky. Not being familiar with Roussel's work I snatched this up on the basis of some positive reviews I read. I was disappointed. The two ballets on this disc are rather conservative works more reminiscent of Delibes or Minkus than the extraordinary works that Diaghilev was commisioning at the time. Fans of 19th century ballet may like it more than I did.
(Please note that this review is intended for those familiar with MMORPGs who are unsure as to which would be a better choice)There seems to be an unceasing war between fans of Everquest 2 (EQ2) and World of Warcraft (WoW) about which is better. Both parties seem to have an endless amount of terrible things to say about the other game, the other game's players, and the company behind the games.Having played both games for over two months and having achieved a moderate amount of success in both, my opinion is this:EQ2 is extremely community-centric. On average, especially on roleplaying servers, the players are friendly and, if not friendly, tolerable. Most are actively looking to take part in the community aspect of the game and enjoy playing with others. The game's solo vs group dynamic clearly enforces this: although the devs have done a lot to improve the solo game, EQ2 remains almost a completely group-oriented game past level 20 for all players, past level 10 for some classes. If you want to solo, you can, but you will advance much more slowly than the average group will. Leveling also takes time: although the first ten levels and to a lesser extent the next ten can be achieved in a week of moderate playing, levels 20-50 take a significant amount of time to achieve and require a certain dedication to building relationships with other players in order to have a group readily available. The developers of EQ2 also seemed to focus on immersion in a fantasy world, which lends itself to more in-depth roleplaying (which, not to be discriminatory, has resulted in a much older average age in the player base).WoW, on the other hand, is EXTREMELY solo friendly. I leveled through 40 in a month with a moderate amount of solo play (10-20 hours/week). For those who do not have the time required to develop a lot of relationships online or do not have a lot of real-life friends playing the game with them, this makes WoW much more appealing. This game dynamic has, however, resulted in a fragmented player community made up mostly of people who do not understand group dynamics at a level necessary to accomplish group tasks. The cartoon-esque graphics and Warcraft name have also drawn a much younger crowd than EQ2, and it shows: griefers abound, instant-messaging shorthand is everywhere, and no one really seems committed to the idea of roleplaying.So really, it's a choice: which of those two seems more appealing to you? If you want a more mature, community-based timesink of a game, EQ2 is probably your best bet. If you want a casual, soloable game that doesn't punish you for taking a week off but lacks anything even remotely resembling a decent online community, WoW is a much better choice.
When I heard the single I Don't Wanna Stop I thought it was the best Ozzy song in years so I bought the CD.I found 9 more songs that I thought were Ozzy's best in years.Ozzy doesn't try to reinvent himself here.It's Ozzy doing what he does best.Much better than his cover album My only complaint is the packaging which is really nothing more than a "sleeve"with not much info
While packaged in a somewhat overly fussy sleeve, with the same info repeated several times, this is wish fulfillment for fans of pre-BLUE BELL KNOLL Cocteau Twins. The alternate versions of early songs esp. highlight Liz's uncanny, howling delivery (I never understood all the comparisons to Siouxsie). &quot;Strange Fruit&quot; is a jaw-dropping fusion of post-punk and the blues... whew! while some tracks are redundant and strictly fan-friendly, nothing seems like filler. The later tracks are a bit weak. However, they feature Liz belting things out in a manner that became increasingly RARE (in the studio at least) after, say, 1988. The band that once sounded like it had at least two vocalists was starting to sound a LOT like its imitators. However, this is highly recommended, especially for those that like they're Twins simple and STARKLY, DARKLY beautiful, rather than obviously &quot;pretty&quot;...
4 me, the best science fiction novel EVER. DYING OF THE LIGHT (originally called AFTER THE FESTIVAL in its 1st appearance in 1977 in Analog magazine) echoes many of George R.R. Martin's early themes -- lost love, devotion, romantic fantasy vs. grim reality, dark & moody settings, finding heroism within yrself, etc. DOTL also shares the same setting & background of many of Martin's early short stories, which will add 2 Njoyment of the novel 4 his fans. Wonderful setting, marvelous characters, great hand-to-hand combat & fierce emotions among believable characters, & a gorgeous heroic ending. George shoulda kept writing like this. Other great early stuff by Martin: WINDHAVEN (with Lisa Tuttle), the short-story collections SANDKINGS, A SONG FOR LYA, SONGS OF STARS AND SHADOWS and NIGHTFLYERS, and parts of THE ARMAGGEDDON RAG. I wish he'd written a couple more SF novels B4 moving 2 TV & what he calls "the big fat fantasy novels" he's writing now. I've bn a Martin fan since '74 -- glad some other folks finally caught on. But I find his early stuff has a romantic sense of mood, vision & soul that his newer work lacks....
I started working on cars as a college student using Chilton's and Haynes manuals. As I got older, I brought the OEM shop manuals and I find that the Chilton's are much better illustrated and easier to use. Us weekend mechanics should just stick with these and save our money. I would rather have a book to flip through than going through a CD to find what I am looking for.
What a riveting account! Orwell manages the difficult task of successfully combining the details of trench life, the description of the turmoils in Barcelona and a comprehensible analysis of the clash of several left-wing political parties during the Spanish Civil war. He even adds some deliciously humorous remarks! And the whole thing is absolutely entertaining, vivid and interesting.Really, one finishes this book and feels a deep respect for this man. It's discouraging to learn that he and so many others who had fought in the trenches had to flee the country or suffer inprisonment and even death, only due to the deep struggle for power between political forces that belonged to the same side! I was impressed by how Orwell describes the passion and idealism that prevailed during the 1930's, specially compared to the sleepy, double-standard ethics of nowadays.As a Spaniard, I admit not possesing deep knowledge about the Spanish Civil War, other than some family recollections and the usual basics. This book helped me learn about the complexities of the &quot;red&quot; side and about the everyday miseries of war.Highly recommended!!
the only part of documentary in this film comes in the form of breaks, and it's just text scrolling down the screen w/ a narrator. there are a few very short interviews w/ gang members, who mostly talk about how many times they been shot or jumped or cuaght slippin.the rest of the dvd is all the members of the cd in the studio rapping... it's boring... if you're wanting to see life on the streets of gangbangers, this is not for you...
I enjoy listening to Dr. Edell and have for many years. Do I like everything he has to say? Nope. I'm a Christian and he's not. He makes fun of his creator...but that's ok... God still loves Dr. Edell. Back to the book - I enjoyed it very much. The people I know who dislike it most are those who are into holistic medicine, quack diets, etc. His science is current and up to date...and fact is fact. His opinions are just that - opinions...and we all have 'em. I read his books for the facts that he gives...not for his opinions on religion.
another 4 and a half star album. &quot;hey little girl&quot; , &quot;great southern land&quot;, &quot;street cafe&quot;, &quot;love in motion&quot; and the sleeper hit &quot;goodnite mr.mathews&quot;, don't forget about the weird &quot; glam&quot; and &quot;uniform&quot; and &quot;trojan blue&quot; which shows a brillant song writer in the making. only setback, some songs sound &quot;dated&quot; A Must Have
As so often happens on Amazon, reviews for a single movie are grouped together for diff disc/releases. Was reading a review of the High School reunion edition, now I'm on Flashback edition....one is one price, the other another, and one for $25+....a crap shoot, my friends, good luck! BTW, the movie is a classic "brat pack", and worth owning.
For those of you into the series, and have just finished Clash of Kings, you're all in for it. This book is full of shock and some of the most tragic moments await you. No one is safe. I remember I read the three books in the series before ever looking at a review for them. And no doubt you will too. But just in case you'd like to know what's coming....The war continues, Stannis was defeated, and Renly....well you know what happened to him. Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy and King Joffrey still have not settled their vendetta. Robb lost the north, which is now in chaos. Even further north the wildlings are rising. There are a lot of chapters with Jon and Tyrion, with a lot of action. Daenerys is learning to rule, while she continues to raise her dragons. There are some great things in store for her. The end will leave you begging for the fourth book. By the way, beware of the Red Wedding...If you haven't read the series, you are missing out on the best fantasy novels since the Tolkien. Martin is probably better. He understands people better than the Jordan's wreck of a series, &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; and its terrible contemporary, Goodkind's &quot;Sword of Truth.&quot; They have dragged their series into huge epics of meaningless words. With Martin there is action. Never has there been a series of such brilliance, perspective, tragedy, intrigue, realism and compulsion. He writes characters like Shakespeare, politics like Machiavelli and history like Tolkien. The dialogue is absolutely clever. Characters are witty, humorous, cunning and so realistic. Magic is very subtle. In the world of a Song of Ice and Fire, sorcery is a myth. No one believes it, but it is there. It occurs like a trick of the eye- not as wizards casting fireballs and lightning bolts. There are no main characters or heroes- everyone plots against each other, and magic cannot save them. There are no dark lords or true evils lurking on a dreary mountain. Not you average fantasy. But way above average.In my experience, this is as good as it gets. Modern writers could learn a thing or two from George R.R. Martin, a master storyteller. He's been a 6-time Locus Award winner for his short-stories, 4 Hugo Awards, 2 Nebula Awards, A Bram Stoker and a World Fantasy Award. A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords have been New York Times Bestsellers. A Clash of Kings had a Nebula nomination and was #1 on the Locus Poll. A Storm of Swords was in first place in the SF Site Readers' Choice Best SF and Fantasy Books, and was in 2nd place for the Locus Award, under Harry Potter. But it was much better than Harry Potter, mind you.If your tired of Jordan, Goodkind and Brooks, read Song of Ice and Fire. &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; is the first book, &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; is the second, &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; is the third and latest. I'm dying for the next book, &quot;A Feast for Crows.&quot; Its been over 3 years now...god, within all that time, I think a lot of people have read up. That'll make the 4th book one of the top bestselling books, when it comes, I hope.Oh yes, I've read a BUNCH of spoiler chapters from Martin's readings at several appearances. Amazing things are waiting for us. Read &quot;Arms of the Kraken&quot; in Dragon Magazine Issue #305, a novella length chapter from A Feast for Crows. There is a VERY VERY VERY unexpected twist at the end of that chapter. It blew me away.
This book was terrible. The writing was childish. This book would have been better if written with teenagers instead of adults. The story went round and round, and the situations she found herself in were ridiculous. I wouldn't recommend this book or this author's childish writing style to anyone.
I really like this CD. Dino plays the songs without embellishment. They sound great. I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone looking for smooth, relaxing, solo piano versions of classic romantic songs.
Better than its predecessor, Anakin is finally played with passion and good 'acting'. Hayden Christiansen is one to watch as the young Darth Vader. The films picks up from Episode I (strangely, ha ha) where the Empire sees the Sith have become more powerful and the clone wars have begun. With the same computer generated style of Episode I, Clones has succeeded in making a very fine looking film. Ewan McGregor is worthy but dismissable as is Natalie Portman (unfortunately two of my favorite actors). Somehow their performances seem on auto pilot as most Star Wars actors have been accused of over the years. Good news, though, Jar Jar Binks has a limited role this time! Although every second he is on screen is still as painful as nails on a chalkboard. With good action sequences and an intriging development in the cause for Anakin's build up of hatred, Clones proves to be worthy of the Star Wars name. ****stars
This is a cute little Bible, well bound (although not leather as listed), but with very tiny type. I can't read it, so I will probably give it to someone with younger eyes than mine.
I love James Patterson books, but the Cross novels are becoming a little predictable, and I think Patterson is losing his hard-hitting edge that was existent in Midnight Club and Kiss The Girls. Still excellent narration, top quality writing and great suspense novels, but not his best.DO! DO! DO! read Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas - don't let anyone tell you its a chick book.
I read this book to prepare lessons for my 6th grade classroom. We were learning about the Terezin Ghetto that was open during WWII in preparation for attending the play I Never Saw Another Butterfly. The book is a collection of poems and visual artwork that were done by Jewish prisoners who were held in this ghetto, mostly by children. The history of the ghetto is amazing and something I was never aware of until I read this book. My students were silent as they read and responded to the poems. We also read large parts of The Cat with the Yellow Star as we studied these poems. The Cat with the Yellow Star is an autobiography of a girl who was in the ghetto and was published in 2007. It helped to round out our understanding of the messages in the poems.
I think that if we are to recieve answers to our questions, we need to understand the questions themselves. Some may say that John's obsesion with William Wallace in Brave Heart is uncharacteristic to Christ. Now i'd admit that he has a very rustic outlook on the male role, but i think the point he's trying to make is to fight like William wallace. Not in a physical sence, in a spiritual sence, because there is a spiritual war going on, and we must cry freedom like wallace, but in the name of Christ Jesus our Lord and &quot;fight the good fight&quot;. There will be people who disagree with me and thats fine, but please remember that we're Christians, what kind of a witness is it to sit at out computers and tell the world how stupid &quot;those other Christians&quot; are. Jesus told us to love each other.
I recently read this book for the second time after ten years had passed from my first encounter with Edward Abbey. Without a doubt this is the best book I have read in years. It moved me personally and taken in the total perspective of his love for the desert Southwest and the individuality of man it is a wonderful insight into Edward the man. Through the eyes of Edward Abbey I have visited and fallen in love with the deserts of the Southwest.
I don't have much to add to the excellent review that Zoom already wrote, except to say that for the small outlay of cash, I find this DVD a worthwhile addition to my Rush collection. After recently buying remastered versions of2112andMoving Pictures (Eco) (Rpkg), and seeing (and buying the DVD of) the excellent documentary,Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage [Blu-ray], I questioned the wisdom of yet one more bit of Rushverse memorabilia. Turns out I still have more to learn, and I was especially interested in learning more about the connection of the story in 2112 with the Ayn Rand work,Anthem, Expanded 50th Anniversary Edition. I knew that 2112 was influenced by Rand, but was under the wrong impression about what that influence had been. That's just an example of the types of revelations on tap in this documentary.And the guys are as low-key and approachable as ever. I said it about "Lighted Stage" and I'll say it about this Classic Albums DVD...the personalities of the Rush bandmates, and their friendship with each other, and their gonzo commitment to their musical vision, make them extremely attractive as artistic icons, even if some of their music is, let's face it, as annoying as hell. (But that doesn't apply to anything on the two albums showcased in this documentary--this is cream-of-the-crop Rush.)
This movie takes you through the final days of Jesse James and the aftermath of his killing. It is indeed a moody film and there is a strong period flavor to it. Those interested in American history and its portrayal in film will most likely enjoy this film. We know what happened to Jesse James, but have you ever wondered what happened to Robert Ford? This film will tell you in stark terms. The acting, directing, narration, screen play, cinematography are all excellent. In an era of superb sound tracks on many DVDs, this DVD is outshone by the competition so much so that I venture to say that the sound track fails, even fails miserably. Perhaps the blu-ray version is better on this score and on the chance that it is and you have a blu-ray player, I recommend you purchase it rather than this regular DVD version. Five stars on all counts but sound. One star at best on sound for an average of four stars overall.
KMD...is by far the most notorious hip hop crew for being undefined, yet always on point with the hip hop dopeness. I find it sad that KMD has to be so mysterious and give no public playlist and/or preview site for these extraordinary contributions to hip hop history. Zev Lov X (x evolvez), Subroc (R.I.P.), and Onyx(the birthstone kid) had a formula of crazy skits, hot bangin' beats, and rhymes with more patterns than a fabric store warehouse. This album is pure classic hip hop.
This is the best cover I'ver ever owned or even seen. It's a heavy cover because it's made to be usesd in very heavy duty situations. It completely covers the grill and has a draw cord on the bottom to seal it up.
This C3PO master edition displays very nicely. It includes a C3PO 12&quot; figure. The detail off the figure shines greatly, almost as if it were real gold. The book itself offers some wonderful insight on the Golden Droids collectables as well as character. The display case really brings this true peice of Star Wars artwork togehter. This would make a fantastic gift for any true Star Wars fan.
The first few chapters of this book on the basics of XML are good, but stay away if you're a software developer wanting to learn about XML in depth. Even if you're an XML author, you will find this book lacking in the latter chapters. Almost all the discussion is extremely general and theoretical. Occasionally the author sprinkles in a few fucntional XML snippets, but they are not nearly enough. Furthermore, there are only about a dozen complete examples of functional XML available in the tar/zip file available online at O'Reilly.The paucity of examples was particularly frustrating in the XSLT chapter. By its very nature, XSLT screams out for illustrative examples showing 'before' and 'after' transformations, but the author provides very few such examples.Another thing that really irked me was the condescending writing style of the author. Here's an example from Ch. 4 on CSS:&quot;A CSS stylesheet is a collection of rules... An analogy for this process is painting-by-numbers. In this activity, you purchase a painting kit that comes with paints...&quot;Really now! This style of writing is not necessary and is frankly offensive. XML inherently is not a beginner's topic; a reader who picks up this book is most likely an IT manager or a developer and does not need to be talked-down upon.If you're a java developer, I suggest you take a look at &quot;Processing XML with Java&quot; by Harold.
It Came before the long due date. Good condition. Pleasant experience. I Would buy from again and I wood recommend.
I felt the story in this book was not 100% complete toward the end. For example, **** showed up a couple of times in the story and no mention about him/her at another time, what happened to him/her or what is being done for the crimes being committed (ongoing investigation) and so forth. Overall, the book is still good and worth a read, full of suspense toward the end. I was surprised, but it made sense when you think about the circumstances around it.
My friends call them my &#34;40s shoes&#34; and I get compliments on them all the time at work which is pretty much the only place I wear them. They are sturdy and comfortable but I had to add no-skids to them to keep from slipping on the hardwood floors. Even on stage I used to have to do that. I wish they made these for everyday wear like with a real heel cover and weatherproof bottom sole but hey - these arent for wearing around town after all. Still I love em and think theyre great! I also have them in black.
This is the second book I didn't like written by the GW, the first being Melody (which got better the second time I read it.) This one didn't. Unfortunately I think that the GW ran out of ideas and decided that he had to crush poor Rain. I mean come on. SPOILERS!! First he kills off her brother and then there is her accident. Then all that stuff that Victoria put her through? It was redundant for one thing. He kept going over what Victoria was doing to her even though he had just said it a few pages before! This was definitely a poor one on Neiderman's side. But oh well, my VCA site can't have all good reveiws lol. If you have to read it, I recomment waiting for it to be at the library or the used bookstore.
Great movie adaptation of the book a Princess of Mars! Fun, exciting, endlessly beautiful and fascinating! I recommend it for the whole family!
Absolutely boring, and with an enerving camera style, this is one of the worst movies i've ever seen. The plot and characters are absolutely stupid and predictable, and even worst, they don't evolved a little bit in all the entire movie.The best part is the skateboard dog and the goods looks of Steven Strait, but if you really wanna enjoy him, i better recommend you THE COVENANT. Is the typical horror flick, but at least, is not so presumptuos that this one.
I've been using this printer for more than 3 months and so far haven't had any issues with it. It's very easy to install and use.If you are using a network connection and software doesn't detect scanner, then you need to setup printer network configuration manually. Don't use default "auto" setting, instead enter your network parameters, including network speed and duplex.Printer does curl paper, but very slightly. It hasn't been a problem even when printing 100 of pages. Paper jams or overlow are very rare. Automatic feeder works without problems with 20-24 lb common stock. The manual feeder is very poorly designed, the printouts often come out skewed. Otherwise it's a very solid and very inexpensive device. In my estimates printed page costs about 1.8 cents (at current toner prices), or about 2.5 cents when drum replacement cost is taken into account.So far I've been using the starter cartridge rated at 1500 pages. The printer showed the first "end of life" message after about 1550 pages. After shaking and reinserting the same cartridge twice I've been able to print another 170 pages.Printer is pretty fast, just a few seconds warmup time, and print speed is pretty much in accordance with the spec. Regarding the noise level -- it's just everage, like most other printers in $200 range.
This is a little spendy---but--well worth your investment. I'm not sure what the ingredient is that helps heal---but it's AMAZING....
i dont do a lot of bread making but i am an avid meat smoker and griller. the taylor classic roast-yeast thermometer has taken the stress out of preparing a feast for my guests. i have tried more expensive thermometers but some read out an obvious wrong temperature and others are very difficult to read. the taylor thermometer solves both problems! whether you do most of your cooking outdoors or in your kitchen this thermometer will give you peace of mind. well worth the price and ships fast.
This power supply unit is a good buy. It even has 2 plugs for to connect chassis fans, allowing very quiet running. The look is good & it works good too. There's no complaints on this power supply unit.
This is a very realistic looking 3 stone CZ ring. I estimate a total Carat weight equivalent of about 2.25. My only complaint is that the the stones are not quite as wide-set as I was expecting from the picture. They do not cover the entire top of my finger. However, the overall quality and value of this purchase was excellent.
Using hand drawings that are clearer than any photograph, THE MARLINSPIKE SAILOR (c.1960) by Hervey Garrett Smith illustrated in a 131 page soft cover book a collection of the best detailed renditions of basic knot tying and ropework any beginner can learn to start his ropework career, or for an old hand to refresh his memory.There is no waste as only essential rope skills are shown in clear etchings, line drawings, and pencil sketches, which will make the wooden sail boat owner self-sufficient from a lot of expensive, store-bought textile gear.In a written text accompanying each excellent drawing, Hervey Garrett Smith explained the purpose of each rope related product; such as: knob knots used for drawer handles, baggy wrinkle for chafe gear, coach whipping for stanchion rails, rope shackles for your storage chest, sewing skills to make gear bags and sail mending, netmaking for storage, and rope fenders for hull protection. The author included no superfluous skills or fancy work (MacNamara's Lace as we called it in the Navy).There is more than a hint of Yankee frugality pervading THE MARLINSPIKE SAILOR as Hervey Garrett Smith promotes self-sufficiency through recycling old rope and canvas, or anything else that can be salvaged and made useable.THE MARLINSPIKE SAILOR is an important and useful book for the beginner to teach themselves the fundamental skills necessary to quickly make oneself a useful member of any traditional sailboat crew. This book should be read in conjunction with both THE ASHLEY BOOK OF KNOTS and SEAMANSHIP IN THE AGE OF SAIL.
The subtitle of this SACD is "The Ultimate Audio Experience". But open the notes, and you discover that all the tracks save one are from 44, 48, and 96KHz PCM sample original sources. There are some great performances here --- forever trapped in mid-definition resolution. They date from 1993 to 2003, a surprising number of them being recorded in 2001-2003, after DSD recording was available. In listening to this SACD, I was beginning to have doubts about the SACD format until I noticed the sources in the liner notes.The one DSD recording here is the Dvorak Slavonic Dance op. 71 #1 with Ivan Fischer and the Budapest Festival OrchestraDvor&aacute;k: The Slavonic Dances [SACD]. My reference is Reiner's performanceDvorak: Slavonic Dances & Brahms: Hungarian Dances / Fritz Reiner Conducting The Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, and I would have to say that I prefer Fischer's performance, which has tremendous nuance and exuberance.I would skip this SACD unless you want it to demonstrate the limits on 96KHz-and-under digital recording to your friends and colleagues. May it also serve as a warning about buying DGG SACDs, most of except for the brand new crop are recorded in 96KHz PCM. It's sad --- Poor Hillary Hahn in the 21st centuryBrahms, Stravinsky: Violin Concertos [SACD] is trapped with lower fidelity recordings that Jascha Heifetz in his late 1950s tape recordings, now available on SACDBrahms, Tchaikovsky: Violin Concertos [Hybrid SACD].I've recently discovered the PentaTone label, which is a new DSD recording company --- so you are guaranteed to get the real deal with their SACDs. I have been very pleased with the ones I've tried so far --- the only SACD (analog->DSD) recording of Szeryng I've foundPaganini Violin Concertos 1 & 4, andStay in Tune with PentaTone [Hybrid SACD],Mendelssohn: Piano Trios Nos. 1 & 2 [Hybrid SACD],Beethoven: Piano Trios Nos. 2 & 5 "Ghost Trio" [Hybrid SACD].
The author attempts to run the three biographies in parallel but what really happens is that she jumps from one place to the other, so none of the biographies unfold properly. I found it utterly unreadable. On top of it to add to my frustration, there are generalities, like Elizabeth fought with her mother "like all adolescent girls do" or romantic creations "like on this day if you didn't watch out a dog might have showered you with water". I wanted to read a proper biography and not a society novel. I had read "Eden's Outcasts" by John Matteson before and came away with a more lively picture of Elizabeth Peabody and her involvment in the Temple School then from this book. If you are interested in the transcendentalist movement, the time, or women I highly recommend "Eden's Outcasts: The story of Louisa May Alcott and her father".
I absolutely loved this book! This was the first Claybourne book I had read, but have just ordered all the rest of her books from Amazon. Great heroine and hero. Truly entertaining, and not at all like Johanna Lindsay, who I also find boring sometimes.
I'm unrelentingly left handed, and this cordless iron accommodates my reversed approach. I did somewhat alter my pace, and now set the iron into the charging cradle when shifting items.Did have a mishap with the tiny cap over the water spout...I left the removable water bin out to dry, and one of the cats knocked it to the floor displacing that tiny cap. It has yet to reappear (?under a bookshelf, ?down the vent, ?who knows). Still able to use the iron just fine, although energetic movements with full water will expel a few drops.
I enjoyed this book a lot, it's just what I was looking for: I wanted to get the big picture of what happened in WWI. Great mix of biography, historical background and battles. Great flow of narrative, never too much or too little.
The Oathbound Wizard is about a boy called Mathew that has travelled through dimensions and has ended up as the Lord Wizard in a country called Merovence.In this world thigs you say are taken more literally than here and Matt swears that he will overthrough the evil Wizard Lord of Ibile.Matt goes into Ibile and defeats the evil Lord (picking up loads of friends on the way) and marries Queen Alisande of Merovence.
The heroine is a twenty-five-year-old spinster who is still traumatized ten years after seeing her wastrel brother-in-law commit adultery. Now if it had been SHE who had been the recipient of his adulterous attentions, I could understand how the experience might have warped her emotionally to such an extent that she would refuse to marry. But only a silly ninny would react in such a dramatic way TEN YEARS LATER to what she saw that day in the folly. You can almost hear the organ play whenever she refers to "the Secret" (note the capital S) that she fears will turn any potential husband against her.The hero isn't credible either, being a rake and a libertine with the reputation of going after only the most beautiful women. After determining that Daphne is the most beautiful woman in existence--and that her background is somewhat doubtful--he determines to make her his mistress. It is only when his father--at the request of her dying grandfather--insists that he marry her that he even begins to consider the possibility of marriage to anyone, and then suddenly, he is in love and excited about having a family.Why the hero's father--a duke--would comply with the grandfather's request to the extent that he would order his son to marry a girl with a murky background is another problem that is not adequately explained. The multitude of pregnancies and impending births at the end is rather overdone; I'd much rather see more development of the hero and heroine's relationship at that point.Except for the references to characters in Ms. Oliver's other books, I would not have believed that this one was written by the same person. Could this be a case of identify theft?And then there are the errors in referring to the titles of various noble characters, but one sees those in many of these novels.But by far the biggest problem is that the most interesting character in this silly Regency is the diary!
I think this and Tattoo You are all you need from this hugely overrated band. Some Girls is great and has a few terrific songs in Shattered. Get it, but stay far away from the BIGGER BANG album that sucks big time.
I just replaced two of these at home with 5 port trendnet gigabit switches instead.When initially started I would see gs605v2 provide gigabit speeds but either pc copying files would only use 20% of the available gigabit speed as reported by windows 7 networking tab on task manager. Frequently one pc would drop to 100TX speed and the other pc would see 8% network activity when copying files to / from the other.Both gs605 switches would become hot to the touch when left on for long periods of time. Both were left in well ventilated areas.So I replaced these with the trendnet switches instead and now I see 47% network utilization. I use cat 5e cabling and now copy files at roughly 2gb/minute where before I would see ~ .5 gb/ minute.
Good acting. Great Plots. Phenomenal quotes.I can't comment on DVD quality as I watch on television. But Criminal Minds has to be one of the best shows ever.They usually have a quote at the beginning and end of each episode, pertinent to the story line.The premise of the show can be a little weird sometimes. They follow the Behavioral Analysis Unit of the FBI as they chase down serial killers. One of the key parts was played by Mandy Potemkin and now by Joe Montagna. Both are great acting jobs, as are those by Matthew Gray Gubler and others. Sometimes Shemar Moore is a little full of himself, but it doesn't detract from the show.If you only get CM once a week on CBS and don't get ION TV, get this set. You'll watch them over and over. A few episodes are classic, and you'll watch them until the discs wear out.Can't recommend the show more highly.If you Google Criminal Minds quotes, you'll find them all and get an idea of,what I'm talking about.
Not a bad book if you are new to Rod Serling's career. However, it's sad when even Rod Serling's widow speaks publicly on a negative level about this book. For a starting point of interest, there are better books available within an arm's reach. Chances are, if you are looking at this book on Amazon as a possible purchase it is because you are seeking out a book about THE TWILIGHT ZONE or NIGHT GALLERY. If this is so, save your money and avoid this book and buy the two listed below. You'll do yourself justice and thank me in the long run.ROD SERLING'S NIGHT GALLERY: AN AFTER-HOURS TOUR by Scott Skelton and Jim Benson offers 390 plus pages of behind-the-scenes critical analysis and facts with exclusive interviews with cast and crew.THE TWILIGHT ZONE: UNLOCKING THE DOOR TO A TELEVISION CLASSIC by Martin Grams is 800 plsu pages and includes "everything" about the classic series. The details about Serling's writing career on radio, early television and Twilight Zone is well researched and highly detailed. Exclusive interviews with cast and crew and behind-the-scenes trivia will floor you.Both books available on Amazon.com
Ms. Dowd definitely had vision and understanding of exactly what we would be looking at as a nation. She could see the damage that was going to be done by King George Bush. It is eerie to read this book now when it was published at the end of 2004.
I suggest you buy this movie if you find it, it has been pulled from publication for a very dubious rea. IMHO, the TV series "LOST" is using key points of this movie for it's plot concept.Anyhow, it is darn good cheesy sci-fi!
I have had this CD for years now, and among all my motion picture soundtrack CD's, I would have to say that the sound quality on this so-called "remastering" is unimpressive. This may partly be the fault of the film. I remember that when I first saw it at an old-fashioned movie palace on its original roadshow release, the sound was impressive, but not as impressive as it could have been, even in a huge theatre. I wasn't as overwhelmed by the stereo and the sheer majesty of the sound as I was when I saw similarly shown films like "The Sound of Music" and "Camelot", or "Ben-Hur" upon its 10th anniversary re-release. And even on its VHS releases, the stereo in "Oliver!" does not sound as "bright" or "spectacular" as other similarly recorded films.However, remastering SHOULD improve the sound. Instead, the sound on this CD leaves you with a feeling of "Why did they bother?" It isn't BAD sound, really, just not nearly as good as it could have been, especially with the technological advances of the last twenty years, and ESPECIALLY in view of the fact the three greatest Rodgers and Hammerstein soundtrack albums, all made more than a decade before "Oliver!" have all been recently re-mastered so that they now sound as good or better than "Oliver!" And it would help greatly if an expanded version of the "Oliver!" soundtrack were released, especially since this version commits the unpardonable sin of leaving out some of the actual song verses to accomodate the dance music into an album that plays 50 minutes.The actual performances on this album, however, are excellent, especially Ron Moody as Fagin and Shani Wallis as Nancy.
Thai historian Thongchai Winichakul's account of a critical period in Thai history pairs an originalap proach with thorough academic research. As the subtitle `a History of the Geo-Body of a Nation' already suggests, the book deals with the crucial episode of the formation of Thailand as a nation-state.Inspired by Imagined Communities, Benedict Anderson's seminal work on nationalism, the author explains in his introduction that he intends to focus his analysis on a by historians much neglected aspect of the spatio-temporal category: geography.Taking the traditional Buddhist worldview as a starting point, he describes how 19th Century Siam, as Thailand was then called, had to come to terms with the many alien concepts considered commonplace in the science of modern geography. Many of these concepts were to have important political implications.Deriving its political system from the Buddhist `Mandala model', the Siamese initially had great difficulies coping with the elementary aspects of political geography. Boundaries and more in particular border demarcations were, if not unknown altogether, considered of minor or no importance in the political view of the traditional ruling class. The Siamese were perfectly at ease in dealing with often illdefined and fluid spheres of influence, frontiers and the `thick lines' of the boundary regions separating the indigenous political entities of Southeast Asia. Likewise they saw no contradiction in the double sovereignty under which the territories at the `margins' of the regional kingdoms often fell.But the Siamese proved to be fast learners and Thonchai quickly dispels the myth that the Siamese were mere victims of or only innocent bystanders at the high political game that was played by the colonial powers in 19th Century Asia. Instead he contends that Siam was very conscious of what was at stake and was just as much a player as Britain or France.`Siam Mapped' is an innovating, provocative and very refreshing account of a very important phase in the history of Thailand. Already exercising its influence on the further course of research into the development of the Thai national-state, this book is a must-read for anyone with a serious interest in the history of Thailand or nationalism in general.
A woman with no memory of who she is or where she came from in a wedding dress stained with blood. A retired cop turned PI with issues of his own. Who or what is &quot;Mary&quot; running from? Where did the blood on her dress come from? And who are the men claiming to be her fiance?This is one of those rare finds. A book you can't put down once you pick it up. You'll give up a night of sleep for this one, but it's well worth it. Sally Steward delivers romance and suspense on a grand scale in Private Vows! Another Sally Steward/Sally Carleen for my keeper shelf. Don't miss this one!
I purchased the whole series, partly because I love it and partly because it goes down as the most tremendous undertaking ever attempt for television.The last Chapter is both appalling and mesmerizing. Sir John Gielgud's performance as the redeemed Aaron Jastrow is magnificent and worth the price alone. The work of Polly Bergen and Mitchum and Jane Seymour are a bonus.
A must have for the Catholic Faith. Commisioned by John Paul II, a hardback, how can you go wrong! This is the latest or 2nd version most up to date.
Lusty, naughty in the bad raunchy way. Loved it !Brandon's crew members bring Heather to him as female entertainment. She's an innocent country mouse/Cinderella. Found on the docks in a doxy's outfit. How's the captain to see she's in shock? There's been some mistake? Even while the captain's aware of her virginal demeanor; he believes she's just begun the 'profession' - which leads to the controversial rape scene.The story goes from the English countryside - to a London dockside - out to sea - a southern plantation ... The author wisks you place to place.
Just Jaeckin, "master"-ful director of Emmanuelle, must have salivated at the chance to adapt the novel by Pauline Reage. The story gives ample opportunity for "O" to have casual [love] with many, many partners while still extolling flighty principles of devotion. The fact that anyone would think this movie has principles is laughable. But one has to admire the audacity of Mr. Jaeckin in thinking that people will view this as a masterpiece of modern art. I am almost certain that most people who will purchase this film will do so out of self-gratitude rather than intellectual pursuits. I guess some people will get their jollies any way they can. As a side note, the commentary track by the director is actually pretty entertaining. He has a lot of amusing (possibly unintentionally) insights into the film that makes the commentary track far more interesting than the film itself. If you are a huge fan of commentary tracks, you might want to check this out as a rental. Otherwise, keep your pants on and avoid The Story of O like the plague
This book has many fine qualities. The author's tone is friendly and laid back; she offers a lot of encouraging words while also remaining consummately professional. Most of the important topics are covered, and in good detail--it's almost like having a conversation with her at your side. Obviously, Dr. Brasner is a skilled and compassionate physician, and it was really interesting to hear her describe her own care (as she had twins with a c-section). However, if you want 1) complete details on all aspects of pregnancy and childbirth (both pleasant and unpleasant), 2) solid information on a more natural, family-centered childbirth or a birth with minimal intervention, 3) complete information on epidurals, induction, continous monitoring, and other interventions, you will not want to rely solely on this text. Granted, Dr. Brasner is very honest and upfront about her opinion on the topic of medical intervention; there is nothing hidden. For example, she clearly feels that epidurals are a great thing, spending minimal time addressing any possible negatives of an epidural (and they do exist). I am very glad I read this book, for it offered me a new perspective. However, for the more &quot;complete&quot; picture, I feel there are better choices (i.e. The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby, or A Good Birth, A Safe Birth, or one of Henci Goer's works). This is a decent &quot;supplemental&quot; reading to add to your shelf, but I urge all moms-to-be, even those who don't aim for unmedicated childbirth, to not let this be the only book and perspective they use.
I have used this blade in my miter saw for the last 3 years. The blades hold up well and make very clean cuts and is nearly vibration free. Under moderate use, I have found the blades to last 12-16 months before they need replacement/sharpening.
I'm absolutely blown away by this recording. Alberta Hunter may have been a blues singer but her phrasing and breath control (at 83!) are fantastic. Quite a few jazz singers could learn a thing or two from listening to her.
Mama won't take your Kodachrome away, it is time and the elements which are attacking your treasured family photographs. Your Polaroid snapshots are fading as you read this. Those &quot;magnetic&quot; photo albums with the adhesive pages are gassing your family pictures to crumbs. Your digital images may not be viewable by your great grandchildren. But don't give up hope - take action. Maureen Taylor's &quot;Preserving Your Family Photographs&quot; tells you how to take charge and protect your family's photographic history. &quot;Preserving Your Family Photographs&quot; shows you how taking some simple steps now will slow down the aging process of your photographs. And its doesn't require a chemistry set. The book further discusses how and when to choose a professional conservator, concerns about digital photography, how to organize your collection, and even how to safely place your treasures in a scrapbook. This book takes up where &quot;Uncovering Your Ancestry Through Family Photographs&quot; leaves off. After you've identified your family photographs, &quot;Preserving Your Family Photographs&quot; tells you how to keep them for generations to come.
If you are looking for an easier to read manual of the Canon EOS 2000, this is the book for you. If you are a novice wanting to learn about photography, forget about it.I bought the Canon EOS 2000 because I wanted to learn to take professional pictures yet have the automatic features so I can take &quot;good&quot; pictures while I am learning. I expected this book to help me make the jump from using the automatic features to using the camera in the manual mode. In other words, I expected to learn something about photography. Unfortunately, this book did not help.The book does a reasonable job of explaining the different automatic modes and situations where they should be used. It also provides information about how to change the settings of the camera and some basic information about how you can take better pictures. At the same time though, it does not teach anything about photography. I guess they assume that someone wanting to know about the manual settings is already versed in photography and knows what to do with them. In my case, they were wrong.A huge portion of the book is dedicated to lenses. It uses more than 50 pages of the 175 pages for providing the history of removable lenses, zoom lenses, and listing the different lenses available for the camera. While this maybe a helpful reference sometime in the future, it does virtually nothing for teaching me about photography. Disappointing.The bottom line is that if you are looking for getting more information about the camera, you will find it here. If you want to learn something about photography, look somewhere else.
Good war love story. Have it on VHS which was on cable at one time so got it on DVD now. Romance in wartime.
As someone in the process of writing a Ph.D. in bioethics, allow me to say that this is essential reading. Not only has Patrick Lee written a great introduction to natural law thinking, he may also have written the single best pro-life book in print today. Lucid, concise, and logical, I think of this work as a standard that my thinking should be modeled after and should measure up to. I encourage all Christian philosophy students to get a copy and keep careful notes. Also, be sure to check out other writers from the same school, namely, Robert P George and John Finnis.
I was told to use Pampers wipes and diapers from the beginning, but received some of these Huggies wipes at my shower. I decided to use them and they were like sand paper compared to Pampers brand. Yes, they are thicker, but the Pampers remove the poo just as well. I went by what would feel best to my baby, and that was the Pampers, as I knew they felt better to me. I can't say enough good things about Pampers wipes and diapers for that matter. I didn't even use the rest of the pack on my baby, I just couldn't do it. I hope this helps any parent trying to choose the best thing for their baby.
I've been using Palm and Pocket PC / Windows CE devices for almost seven years now. Palm Pro, Palm IIIx, Visor, Visor Edge, several Clies, Nino, iPaq 3600, iPaq 3800, Jornada, Cassiopeia, Maestro, Razor Zayo...I'm hardly a newcomer here.That said, every device had some sort of flaw. PalmOS was too limited to be a decent value, while Pocket PC / CE devices were too heavy to keep in my pocket. Finally, HP got it right.The h2215 is the perfect balance between a powerful OS, powerful hardware, and a device you can truly keep in your pocket. The expansion options are absolutely wonderful -- you've got CF I/II and an SD slot that supports SDIO, so you'll always be able to have extra memory, without sacrificing wireless connectivity.While Pocket PC 2003 isn't much different than 2002 in terms of cosmetics, it's a huge leap forward in terms of stability and ease of use. Connecting to wireless networks is a snap, and I've yet to have anything cause me to do a reset.The h2215 is light, and easy to hold. The rubberized grips are absolutely perfect -- just light enough to keep the unit firmly in your hand, but not as uncomfortable as the grips on the side of the Dell Axim.The best part (at least for me) is that old iPaq accessories work on the h2215. I was able to pull the sync cable I bought for my old 3800-series out of the closet, and plug it right in to the 2215 without any problems.This is truly the best PDA I've ever carried. At this price, it's a steal.
what can i say,i got the cd because i loved "i'm just a kid". THE ONE FROM "The New Kid" SOUNDTRACK!!! this version is pathetic. i mean, if they go big, horray for them but lets just say i won't be cheering them on next time im in some podunk club downtown.get midtown or NFG if you want to enjoy some REAL punk music.
Cult albums all sound so different that inevitably everyone has their favorite, so it's no surprise that there are people who dislike this album. They want it to sound like Love, or Sonic Temple, or Electric, so those that are disappointed that they didn't get their wish are quick to dis it. It was the same when &quot;The Witch&quot; single came out - the first reaction was &quot;What the *^%?&quot;, which was followed by the realization that it was a great song. While this album may not have as distinctive a sound as those other Cult albums, it's still a great listen. It does, however, require a commitment to listen to it a few times, at least.The tracks that are the most fun to listen to are Wild Hearted Son and White, but Earth Mofo and Wonderland will not go out of your head. Especially Wonderland - it is an amazing, amazing track. Full Tilt, Ceremony and Sweet Salvation are the low points of the album, but are still good enough that you wouldn't skip them.Well worth having, especially for a Cult fan. Wait until the next, self-titled album before coming to the realization that The Cult eventually just ran out of gas.
Best known for "Rock On", the rest isn't much stylisticly similar, it's feeble '60's attempt at God-knows-what - it's not really Pop, and it's definitely not Rock and Roll. NOT RECOMMENDED!
I purchased my Roomba back in August when both of my other vacuums died at the same time and needed to be replaced. I was really in the market for a traditional vacuum, but I saw the rave reviews this little one was getting so I decided to try one. (I also purchased an inexpensive traditional vacuum for stairs.)Like everyone else, I am crazy about my Roomba! Not being the greatest housekeeper by any means, I probably vacuumed my carpets about once a month. I never realized they were so dirty until I put Roomba to work. Now I vacuum the floors at least twice a week and am amazed at how much dirt and dust gets picked up each time, not to mention cat hair!Roomba cleans under most of my furniture, including under my bed, which probably hadn't been cleaned in years, since the room's too small to move it anywhere and the traditional vacuum won't reach. You quickly learn where the problem areas are where it might get stuck, and sometimes I just rescue it by picking it up and sometimes I put up a virtual wall to prevent the problem. In any case, it's a lot easier than vacuuming the old-fashioned way. I usually turn it on while reading the newspaper in the morning.If you have pets you will have to take out the brushes and clean them every week or so, because hair does get wound around the ends and impedes the brushes from working properly. It's not difficult to do and it actually makes me feel good to know that my Roomba is doing such a good job!DO get the rapid charger and an extra battery. The built in charger takes 12 hours and is nearly shot after a thorough cleaning of my large living room, although it will do two of the other rooms. Still, if you want to do more than a room or two a day, you'll be grateful for an extra battery, especially when you can charge it in 2-1/2 hours instead of 12!The only negative I can think of is that I nearly always have to search under all the bedroom furniture to find it when it stops, because the room is small and doesn't have a lot of open floor space, so when it stops, it's nearly always under the bed or the dresser or something. But when I see all the dust it picks up--especially in that room which hadn't been thoroughly cleaned in YEARS--I feel so good that my room is so much cleaner than it used to be that I don't mind playing a little hide-and-seek once or twice a week.
This band don't have much talent at all. Think of the tracks on here, at least. Most of it is fairly crappy, with Papa Roach's producer here. Obviously, it's gonna be stupid-sounding. Especially this. I'm not a metal hater, but I don't like Drowning Pool because of bad lyrics and bad music.Here's what you should think of:1 and 11: Mocking religion. That's what they do. And it's pretty recycled, too. Musically, I prefer pure static over this. The offkey singing does nothing for me.2: whooo! "We're adrenaline-pumping music! We repeat ourselves" ... "Bodies". The song's melody is mediocre in the verses, but other than that, there's nothing redeeming. Try pissing and singing the "something's got to give" lines. It works.3: Self-centered. That's what I get out of it. The lyrics and singing are so bad, I'd wanna be deaf. "damn I love myself" is not gonna impress me.Before I get repetitive, I'll tell you, "Reminded" is the only good song on the whole thing. It is relationship-like, but nonetheless, they're like a [mainstream] version of Coal Chamber or Sepultra.If you want good metal, listen to Gravity Kills, KoRn, System of a Down, Sevendust, and others, but not this.
The first of the feature films centered on the Next Generation crew is also probably the best. The film continues to develop Data's character, using an emotion chip that provides several hilarious scenes and more range to Brent Spiner's excellent portrayals. Picard has some moving moments as well, in a plot that includes aspects of time travel and wish fulfillment that allow him to meet James T. Kirk (William Shatner) from the original Enterprise! Various character developments and really epic events toward the end of the film make this "must-viewing" for anyone who wants to follow the series! A real pleasure to watch, despite a great variety of moods and plot elements. And even though Malcolm McDowell is handed a rather cliched "villain" role, he manages to just barely keep that character out of the standard "snarling villain" stereotypes that pervade so many of the other Star Trek feature films. Although Trek worked best as a television series, of all 10 Trek films that were based on those series, I feel this film is a strong candidate (with Star Trek IV) for being the best one. (I do not count the new "Star Trek" movie by J.J. Abrams, since the only person with that film that had any involvement whatsoever with the earlier productions was Leonard Nimoy, and since the film contradicts so many of the established norms for the show.)
I needed a funnel to transfer used oil for recycle drop off. The shape and size of this funnel make it ideal for transfering my used oil to 1 gallon containers. The funnel also has a built in screen. This is important to me because I can check for metal shavings or other debris. And the price was great too.
Bought this to put in my bedroom. It works great at bringing in cool air and when its hot inside your house, you can easily switch it to taking air out of the room. Had this for a very long time and it works great, highly recommend this.
The Good -A few of the main concepts of the book are sound and time proven, and it has some interesting and novel ideas. Unfortunately, this only fills about 20% of the book...The Bad -What was meant to be an entertaining fictional side plot, in the fashion ofThe Goal: A Process of Ongoing ImprovementorThe Max Strategy: How a Businessman Got Stuck at an Airport and Learned to Make His Career Take Off, doesn't work. It ends up being both corny and antiquated. Basically, the main character of the book is a 20 something trying to save the large conglomerate which employs him. Give me a break - this just isn't realistic in the modern world. The vast majority of my peers including myself (in that age group) could care less about the slow and large, uncaring bureaucracies we work for. If anything we're dreaming up of escape plans to start our own businesses. Throughout the book I just kept wondering whether Steve (the main character) was a complete moron or whether the story took place 30 years ago (when my parents were that age).A bigger flaw is how the book's concepts are delivered. Hearing the mentor character, Zhiao, give lessons is akin to listening to Bill Cosby's or Grandpa Simpson's random rambling for hours. It's very difficult to differentiate the useless/nonsensical stuff from the decent pieces of data, Zhiao keeps jumping from here and there. Sadly I could go on and on about how horrible the plot and side dialogue are...An example of the dialog:Zhiao, "What kind of fish do you think you are?Steve, "I am a light fish."- enough said.Another problem is that the author doesn't go into more detail with some of his concepts, so what you're left with is some vague idea of them...ConclusionThis is largely a waste of time.
This is an excellent book that also provides answers and suggestions and not just observations on how weak and ineffective security is since 9/11. Everybody knows the issues but analysis is limited and nobody has real solutions although this book provides many. The author's long time at Kroll, an investigative company very well known on Wall Street, lends a lot more credence than some of the books I read by former rogue news reporters. I also wouldn't give any thought to the anonymous reviewer here who can't be named, gives a bad rating, and is probably a competitor or someone who might have been caught!!! Made me want to buy this book even more...
People seem to think that the Fame soundtrack was better. All I can say, and please excuse me for it: what are you on? I have seen both the play, performed very well by people in Fairbanks (you rock, ppl!) and the movie. And everyone in my family agreed that the movie cannot possibly compare with the play.I will admit that the title song is one of the best songs in the world. But it's not like they took it out of the play. And while Out Here On My Own had a very pretty tune, in the lyrics department it could not hope to compare with songs like Teacher's Argument or In LA.Frankly, there were three good songs in the movie and one that has a good dance scene to it but is not really worth listening to. Of those three good songs, one is in the musical and the other two, while still good, just aren't enough to make me agree that the movie soundtrack could ever compare to this soundtrack.Some people say that the play doesn't touch on important issues like the movie does, and perhaps that is true. But that, it seems to me, is irrelevant while discussing the music, as the music in the movie wasn't about any issues any more than the music in the play is. Another concern is that the lyrics are simplistic. Well, so are the lyrics in the movie. And so are the lyrics to most Abba songs, and most Tatu songs, and most songs in other musicals, say, the Music Man or to some extent Oklahoma and Showboat. Does that make us like them less? You want good lyrics, you go watch something with Sondheim or Cole Porter lyrics.My favorite song on this would probably be Lets Play A Love Scene. Although Fame, Teacher's Argument, and Bring On Tomorrow are excellent. I rather liked In LA, although I maintain that the person in Fairbanks did it better. I Want To Make Magic was very good on this CD, although the song usually sets my teeth on edge for some strange reason. While I dislike the song Can't Keep It Down, I have no complaints about the singer's voice.All in all, this would have to be one of my favorite soundtracks. You want deep lyrics? Go somewhere else (but not to Fame the Movie). You want beautiful and often amusing tunes? Here's a good place to look.
Overall, this is a pretty good phone, and does everything I want it to. It has decent sound and range...but that's what I expected. It has a couple of quirks that prevent it from getting a 5-star rating.First of all, if the answering machine has picked up, it does not know that another extension (in my case, a corded phone) has picked up, and doesn't shut off. Real annoying, especially since it picks up on 3.5 rings (or 1.5 if there are messages). A real pain since these phones are at opposite ends of the house. If I had known this before buying the phone, I would have opted for a seperate phone and answering machine.Secondly, it always adds a &quot;1&quot; and the area code to caller id numbers, even when it is a local call. As an added &quot;bonus&quot; if you just hit &quot;redial&quot; on one of these calls, it will go thru, and you will be charged for a &quot;local toll call&quot;.Third, deleting the &quot;missed calls&quot; list on the base doesn't erase them from the handsets, and vice versa. Deleting the &quot;missed calls&quot; from the handset is not intuitive.
there isn't very many good modern day thrash bands around. But this cd is an exception. This is some of the best that will ever be around, you must listen to this cd.
You would have thought, with a list of brass credits this big, that the music on this album would have more intensity, but aside from 'Alcazar', which is beautiful, the horn section sounds, well, cold and mechanical. It doesn't sound like a seasoned group of musicians, but rather like a CD where each track was put together in the studio (those redundant guitar lines on 'Snakes' are a great example). This includes a section of horns that sound like they were were sampled electronically and added around Sanborn's solo sax. Try Tower of Power for some really emotive brass section work.
I've seen this several times over the years and still can't make sense of why it's such a favorite. The acting is subpar, the drama cheesy and in my opinion as an active duty sailor, fails quite miserably to capture the true spirit of being in the Navy. To think that lunatic Tom Cruise practically built a career off of this garbage...sigh...
I bought and watched this movie when it was first released and haven't watched it since so this is a very belated review. I enjoyed this movie, it was unique, well done and well acted, and creeped me out pretty good. I get tired of the same old plots being re-hashed over and over and this was fresh and different.
What can I say? If you've seen the show you know. Peep is awesome. Opening music by Taj Mahal and narrated by Joan Cusack. The characters are adorable and it's not torture to watch (a million times over) as an adult. If you haven't seen it, you're in for a treat! Just Youtube it before buying. One or two episodes and you'll know whether it's for you or not. My family loves it!
I have several movies like this one, about the murders of women in Mexico along the Bordertown of Juarez. The theme is unsettling, and many movies like this one are poor ripoffs of the Genre, or the situation. This is better done, and the acting is better.
If I'm listening to serious music, like a classical symphony, I will of course put on my expensive phones, but if I'm just listening to You Tube or selecting cuts from Amazon, these work just fine. I probably use them 90% of the time because they have some other important attributes to think about. They fit into a shallow drawer, unlike a lot of full size phones. You can stuff them into a coat pocket. I have found them to be very sturdy. And I find them very comfortable because of their lightness and because the earpiece is small. Also, I have a big head and have trouble with some good headphones that feel like they are strangling my ears. These have a big adjustment range. These are a great buy.
When &quot;My So-Called Life&quot; was taken off the air, I was doubly dissapointed. One, I thought the show was incredible. Two, I thought I'd never hear any of it's chilling music again. Here it is. &quot;Angela Smiled&quot; starts off a beautiful CD with a bang!First, Snuffy is an amazingly tasteful guitar player and the guitar production is incredible (fret noise, buzzing and all). Second, you've never heard anything like these tracks. Well, maybe you have. &quot;Felicity&quot;, &quot;Thirtysomething&quot;, &quot;Once and Again&quot;. But the originals are just as good. &quot;Eugene's Ragtop&quot; smokes with a bluesy swing. &quot;New York&quot; and &quot;Big City&quot; give us a glimpse of Walden's rough side, with just enough bite to demand your attention. And &quot;Love Unspoken, well what can you say. Hold back the tears on this one. Still, with all that, &quot;Angela Smiled&quot; is worth the price of admission alone. Sit back and enjoy it!
My professional background is supply chain consulting, with significant project experience in service parts logistics, inventory management and operations planning and control.I was initially excited to purchase this book, because textbooks entirely dedicated to the topic of service parts are very rare and difficult to find. The book significantly disappointed me in several ways, however.First, the vast majority of the content seems to be comprised of the loose-knit and very informal beliefs and ramblings of the authors. I did not find any kind of unifying framework or suggested strategy(s) presented by the authors, which I beleive is a serious absence. Also, there are several examples in the book where I believe the authors simply just made a statement, without a lot of critical thought or supporting evidence, to put words down on paper.Second, the book is almost entirely dedicated to very technical, low-level topics (for example, part numbering), but the authors fail miserably at presenting the details in a scientific, formal and complete fashion. For example, I have a basic litmus test for inventory texts to gauge their completeness: I check the table of contents for a detailed discussion on segmentation. I am referring to robust, multi-criterion segmentation, where variables such as part criticality, usage variation, availability and dollar-volume are used in multiple ways to truly understand the supply and demand characteristics of a body of inventory. This book has no such discussion.Last, the book seems to me to be just poorly written and produced. Subtopics within chapters do not flow, paragraphs are often fragmented, and points are often made with the implied statement of, &quot;just believe us [the authors] because of our extensive experience.&quot; Many leading edge topics on ideas such as supply chain collaboration, information sharing, outsourcing, advanced decision support and detailed statistical analysis, are not even covered. Also, many of the graphics and diagrams are of a very low quality.I do not recommend this book for any reader. My best suggestion would be to scour the Internet and other inventory texts if you have a critical need for content specific to service parts.
Most regular and organic salad dressings use cheap soy oil, so it's almost impossible to avoid. This salad dressing bottle allows you to make your own dressing simply by shaking the contents in the bottle - cost effective, reusable, and environmentally friendly. Unlike the Good Seasons bottle which snaps on and slips off, the cap to this bottle has threading which allows a more secure grip of the bottle. Then, with the thumb pressed on the cap, the bottle can be shaken. The plastic lid is unlined and does not have any latex glue or film to contaminate the bottle. It's a good bottle to store all sorts of dressings, sauces, and flavored vinegars for a healthy lifestyle.
I own several ASP.NET books, and this has been by far the most useful. It is very readable and contains great explanations of everything. Time after time when I've had a question, this has been the book that gave me the anwer. All the code samples work, as far I've tried them so far. If you are new to ASP.NET, I highly recommend this book. This is not just a simple re-hash of the Microsoft documentation.However, you should know that the examples are in VB.NET only. Also, the examples do not use code-behind.
I believe after The Exorcist 2, The Exorcist series just stedily went down hill. Pt 3 lost its fear factor; The Beginning lost its fear factor and lacked good effects; Dominion had no fear factor at all, the effects sucked, the plotline was not original and it was boaring, the acting was poor, and the movie was about an hour too long. If you want to see movies with great possession scenes check out The first two Exorcist movies, Stigmata, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, or American Haunting. Don't watch this even if it comes on the tv, you'll be waisting your time.
THIS IS A GOOD DOCUMENTARY ABOUT A REAL LIFE HEROIN ADDICT NAMED JOHN SPACELY. IT FOLLOWS HIM IN A REAL LIFE SETTING IN NEW YORK IN THE 1980'S. THE ONLY THING THAT SUCKS ABOUT THE FILM IS ITS A LITTLE ''DULL'' AND ''DARK'' DO TO THE POOR QUALITY OF TECHNOLOGY AND CAMERAS BACK THEN I GUESS. BUT OTHER THEN THAT THIS WAS A GOOD ''REAL LIFE'' DOCUMENTARY ON WHAT ITS LIKE TO BE HOOKED ON DOPE. THIS IS AS REAL AS IT GETS!!! HE'S REALLY GETTING HIGH AND DESTROYING HIS LIFE DEEPER IN THIS FILM. A FEW MONTHS AFTER THIS FILM WAS MADE JOHN SPACELY (THE MAIN PERSON IN THE FILM) DIED AS A RESULT OF A HEROIN OVERDOSE.
The instructions are confusing. They tried to cram them all on the back of the small package and there is only one, useless drawing.My chunk of wood is nothing like the photo and is, in fact, ugly (right half is really dark wood and left is really light).This model holds up to 15 pounds, even if screwed into plain dry wall without a stud (package comes with drywall screws). I might trust my light strat on it, but, due to the fact this hanger projects so far out from the wall, I think this one is really meant for acoustic guitars. I'd get the electric/metal base model "String Swing" for a Les Paul or bass.Other than that, this is a perfectly functional product and this seller shipped it within a few days. It arrived brand new and intact.
All I can say is that this new cd isn't all that great. As a matter of fact, it's rather poor. I've listened to it a few times and I just can't get into it like new cd's that I own. I play a lot of other cd's over and over while Heart's isn't played any longer. Truth be told, I've shelved the thing. People who see Ann and Nancy as gods who can do no wrong will love it and that's fine. I guess I'm not much of a fan anymore. I hope all the rest who buy this cd find things they like.And I'm hoping that someday they will make a followup that will have stronger material. This sure isn't it.
I bought this map because I was headed to Gettysburg with my history-buff husband to see the site of this historical battle. When I got there, I discovered I didn't need the map, but wasn't sorry I had it. The map is also a very concise reference work on this 3-day battle that encompassed 25 square miles, and studying it was good preparation. However, you will find enormous resources at the site for learning about the battle. The National Park Service, as usual, has done an amazing job.If you can afford it, I strongly urge you to hire a "Certified Battlefield Guide." For &lt;$$$> (&lt;$$$> per hour, 2 hour minimum) you get your own personal expert who will drive your car around the site, stopping when you want or when it is appropriate, bringing the historical events to life. We would have kept our guide all day if he had not had another commitment in the afternoon. But we did find that, with his information and this map, we could go back to the battlefield and wander the key areas and have a wonderful, interesting, moving experience. I'm glad I bought the map because it is very well done, but know I could have managed without it.
I won't try to add to already detailed reviews but I will add; buyer beware. The disc I have has an audio glitch which sounds a little like a record passing regularly over a scratch. It's not bad enough to ruin the experience but it is a nuisance. This sort of thing should not be slipping through production.
We live along the pacific central cost about 1000 miles from WWV. We should have no problem getting the signal, but the clock has not worked well.When we got the clock we put a battery in but it never set itself. We contacted the company and were told to use a fresh Alkaline battery, not a rechargeable one. And apparently it needs to be super-fresh---with an exp date at least 6 years in the future.We got a new battery and put it in and the clock did not set itself for 3 days.Today is the change-over from Daylight Savings Time to Standard Time. The clock did not change over.Tech support for the company is weak. The company did not respond to emails. We called them and left a message on an answer machine. They called back, but a day later.I like having a clock that sets itself by radio, but I think that this clock needs either two batteries or a better antenna. And the company needs better tech support.
I'm amazed that this album has such high stars here.Bought back then when it had just come out. What a disappointment it was(I recall only couple of other albums I*ve ordered which have left me pondering as much to what did I end up getting ).The song Say Goodbye to Christopher is just a brilliant track. That one is truly worth 4-5 stars but to me almost all the other tracks are real shallow in comparison (1-2 others I can listen without getting the chills). To me things get too sweet without no rough corners to it. And I really like real emotional stuff, but there needs to be some brilliance to it. Here's a lot of corny lines packed next to each other... Not my cup of tea...
I was surprised to find that this was not just another formula super hero movie. Of course there were tremendous action scenes, and very evil villains, but the hero was different. The hero was intelligent. It was so refreshing to watch someone with great intelligence problem solve during "impossible situations". Also, although he starts out as a rebel with a bad streak, he experiences a major transformation and the audience gets to watch his character develop in a way that I found to be meaningful.Although the movie dragged a bit at some points, it became so interesting that I wanted it to keep going. In fact, I'm really looking forward to the next Iron Man movie (the plot totally calls for it so I'd guess it will happen).I would also mention that Robert Downey Jr. was outstanding. I've always considered him to be one of the greatest actors of our time, and he did not disappoint. Of course Gweneth Paltrow did an excellent job as well.In conclusion, I would highly recommend this movie, particularly to those who enjoy intelligent characters, action, sci-fi and good vs. evil.
Once again, Clancy does his homework and comes out with something that is technically believable, although I have to admit the plot is stretching the envelope of believability. I have but one bone to grind with Clancy, who made his mark by being technically accurate (yes - this is nit-picking). Re the Schloss sequence, infra-red goggles cannot see through closed windows. They will reflect the temperature of the glass, and a person behind the window will remain hidden, unless he presses himself against the glass. Sorry Tom, you messed up there.But that's the only fault I can find. Good job.
This disc is just the hottest, sexiest, sweetest, smoothest, dreamiest disc that I have heard ever. First of all, it's about time someone updated the sound of Bossa Nova. It is not 1965 anymore. Everything on this disc is slowed down, and interspersed with electronica, trip hop beats, slow chill grooves, and deep bass. What an improvement. Half of the songs are straight bossa nova, and half are bossa dance chill electronica, or whatever they are calling it today. The production quality is so clear, warm, modern, first rate, that you will be transported to somewhere in South American on the opening note. The sound quality is definately 21st Century. The production quality of this disc is so unlike anything else that I would buy it just to hear the sound. Astounding is an appropriate term. Now the singing. Bebel Gilberto is so clear, soft, she sells you the sex without any sleaze. She's just so nice. She's just so honest. Her voice is gorgeous. Period. Her voice sells you on how fabulous this disc is. Nine of the eleven songs are sung in Portugese and the other two in English. I don't understand a word she is saying, and I could care less. Brazillian Portugese is so erotic and sensual, I wouldn't have it any other way. When I first put this on and listened I was shocked at the clarity and the atmosphere. This disc is atmospheric. You are in Brasil. Now I want to talk about "So Nice (Summer Samba)". This is a song that is older than the hills and every arrangement makes you feel like you are in a roller rink with the cheesy organ that is always used. No one takes this song seriously anymore. This arrangement is the definitive arrangement of this song. Bebel has taken this song and given it credibility and meaning. When she says that being with you would be so nice, she takes the sleaze out of love. She is the girl next door. I feel like a kid again, with a view of love that is just so nice. I just smile. This song, the way she sings it just makes me smile. The music, the production and the singing on this disc are very special. I have been telling every friend I have about this, and I implore you to buy this disc.
Once again Chuck Norris brings shame the name of Karate. Chuck Norris's fights are so slow and lame that you think the dog could beat him up.For instance... I think everybody who spends two days in a Karate class knows the first thing to do when somone puts you in a headlock is to stomp on their foot. sure there are a billion things you can do to somone who can't lock your neck right, but White belts who are just beginning learn right off the bat the concept of headlock=footstomp! Chuck on the otherhand is put into a poor headlock for a little over a minute standing up before it finally clicks in him to step on the guys foot! Then of corse is the normal Chuck Norris symptom of combos where he does one move... after another...catches his breath... throws another, ect. everything is impractical. Only the extreamly gullable children could respect this stuff.As far as the plot goes, there are a few good lines a lot of bad acting and a long scene where a two foot dog yips at an armed man from ten feet away until he becomes so frightenedd he confesses to the whole plot. Too grown up for children too childish for grownups and too much dispecable nonsense for the living brain
If you enjoyed reading first grade primers of Dick and Jane, then you will like this book because the writer seems almost unable to write a truly interesting sentence. It is filled with sentences that read like this: Mattie sat on the toilet. She was reading a book. The door was locked. She was hungry...I could not finish this book. It is that badly done.
Bought this book for my Mom as a gift. Purchased it along with the Backyard Birder's Box Set (also available on Amazon) and she really enjoys it.
I'll admit, I've never been a Stephen King fan. But I think anyone who reads this would have to agree that without his name on the manuscript, this would've jumped from the slush pile to the recycle bin in a matter of minutes.It's really a short story padded to much greater length, sort of like an egg roll that's stuffed with nothing but cabbage. But what the heck; at least 90% of business books are guilty of that. What really irked me about this book is its outright laziness--aside from leaving the puzzle unsolved, there are some glaring anachronisms that even a junior editor should've caught.Overall, I get the impression that I've put more effort into writing this review than The Great Stephen King put into writing this book. Very disappointing, especially when contrasted with some of the other (older) entries in the Hard Case Crime series. Buy it if you must, but don't say you weren't warned.
On this CD they backed off from the more synthesizer new-age sound thathad been her trademark. This album was practically a hip hop album,nothing really interesting or captivating on this one. I hope they canget back to doing stuff like 'Apples and Diamonds' and 'Tigerlily' andreally all the stuff that came BEFORE this one. That was the nicheBertine had, almost exclusively, and should continue developing.

The Fabulous MoolahYou have a 70 year old women in there with a late 20's early 30s. This match sucked. Moolah wins the title and I don't care if it is a memorable moment, it's stupid. 1/4*New Age Outlaws V. The HollysGood match, but it could have been better. The Hollys win by DQ. **1/2Good Housekeeping Match for the Intercontinental Championship:Jeff Jarrett (Champion) V. ChynaThis match was entertaining, don't get me wrong, but, you have Chyna win the Intercontinental Championship? This is one of the worst moments in the WWF ever. You have a great wrestler in Jarrett jobbing to Chyna? How is a guitar not a household item? I have a guitar, my father has a guitar, hell, my wife even have a guitar. It's a safe beat that most people have atleast one guitar in their house. Jarrett got screwed. He would leave for WCW the next day and one thing that WCW did that I liked was that they put the World Title on Jarrett. The match was a ***The Rock V. The BulldogThis is the British Bulldog getting that push that he should have gotten in his first run in the WWF. Wait, he did, for two months in 1996 and they were awesome matches. The Rock wins and this match could have been a little longer and better. **3/4Ladder Match:The Hardy Boyz V. Edge & ChristianThis is the first ever Tag Team Ladder Match and it won match of the year in 1999 and it's not hard to see why. This was a great moment in the WWF because it helped the company turn the corner if only for a short time until Benoit joins the company and has some great wrestling matches and don't forget Angle who was waiting in the wings for his time to shine. Awesome match with some sick bumps and I think it's the only ladder match that has had only two teams in it, but I'm not sure. Hardyz wins in a classic. *****Val Venis V. MankindThis is Val's big push. This match was actually not that bad. It was actually very good. Val wins and he basically did nothing after this, which is sad, because he is a great wrestler and very underrated. ***1/4Four Corners Elimination Match:Kane V. Bradshaw V. Faarooq V. X-PacGood match, nothing really noteworthly here. X-Pac wins. ***WWF Championship:Triple H (Champion) V. Stone Cold Steve AustinGreat match with, you guessed it, Triple H winning. ***3/4Overall, a good show. Putting the Intercontinental Title on Chyna just gave that great title a very bad name. Triple H wins because Austin needed neck surgery and the ladder match was just awesome.
This very intimate book accomplishes what no bio can: show us inside Kahlo, via her own ramblings and disorganization and odd illustartions and ink spills and lines, and drawings, etc. It is a weird highway to the inner mind of the goddess of 20th century art.With a movie in the works ..., Kahlo is sure to solidify her position as the top-of-the-art-food-chain Latin American artist of the century (Georgia O'Keefe considered her the best female artist of the 20th century) and make her iconic face even more famous.Kahlo deserves this position because she painted honestly and brutally. She painted her memorable Jewish-Austrian-Spanish-Mexican face, single eyebrow and slim moustache in stark honesty; she had many lovers of both sexes (when such a course of sex exploits was practically unknown); she grabbed her Mexicanity with a fierce pride and ferocity that would not be in vogue until decades after her death (Kahlo was born in 1907 and died in 1954) and yet during her life she was just the wife of a very famous Mexican muralist and a champagne Communist who partied with the Fords and Rockefellers while marching with the workers down the wide avenues of Mexico City. It is thus ironic that it is Kahlo, whose astonishing life and unique paintings are now the subject of lawsuits between governments and collectors, has taken the limelight from her talented womanizer husband and is rightfully considered one of the best artists of the 20th century, period. This is a nice addition and a must read for Kahlophiles.
I bought this toaster on Amazon. I loved the style and it seemed like a solid built toaster. First time I used it it smelled like burning wiring. I tried it a second time and the same thing. The smell lingered in my kitchen for half an hour or so. I called Haier and they told me that was not normal and could be dangerous. I immediately returned it to Amazon and asked for replacement but was told they do not have any more. Today a safety person from Haier called me to ask a lot of questions about this toaster and the issues...he told me this model has been discontinued....buy at your own risk....there is a reason it was discontinued...now the market is flooded with them at really low prices compared to the original price. Maybe the problem I had was prevalent.
The cover might suggest it is some Asian-influenced world music, but it's not. Nor it is the 80s pop music, as the Babble used to be a new wave group called Thompson Twins. It is a nice modern (2000s) pop-rock music, with nice rhytms and vocals, a bit smilar to Depeche Mode. To me it is quite addicting, so buy your own copy since you will not find most tracks on audiogalaxy :)
during the few years I worked as a stock broker I used this product for hours a day, my first reason for buying this was to improve my gaming performance; I wanted to be able to train my fingers to click my Playstation controller buttons faster and it ended up serving another purpose, I thought forget "stress balls" this right here is all I need :-)
I completely agree with all the reviewers before me! This series is slowly disintegrating before our eyes.I too would like to read a book (even if I'd have to wait a long time for it) that would at least match the girst books of the series.The characters really seem there only for the benefit of the reader/writer and add nothing to an already shalow and plot-less story.The bad thing is that Ms Kenyon is ruining even the old characters, the ones that made us fall in love with the series in the first place. I'm talking about Acheron Parthenopaeus. Maybe he has another evil twin posing for him in this story, because I didn't catch even a glimpse of the original Ash in here.And let's not talk about his relationship with Nick. What was that all about?!I bought this book in hardcover in hope of getting a certain improvement from the last few books in teh series, but alas it didn't happen.It was a complete waste of money and I can guarantee I'll wait for the next one to hit the shelves in paperback.Because I will continue reading this series, because I love it too much to just go cold-turkey. I just hope it'll improve soon, or I'm afraid it's going to start losing fans pretty soon. It sure isn't gaining any new ones with this kind of performance.
I opened this book and that was the end of me untill I turned the last page. If you love books and your not wealthy but you have pie in the sky dreams about having your own library someday...READ THIS. You can live the folly and reality through this book. You will go on adventures through the halls of bookstores that you have to buz the door to get in and the books sell with the decimal point a bit far to the right for normal people. You will stumble with the authors through the little bookstores with wobbly wood floors and books stacked everywhere. You will dig through the piles of books to uncover some wonderful finds. If you have a bookshelf in your home and for some reason you get joy out just seeing your books, knowing they are there, just touching them and seeing your own identity in what your choose to buy - Get this book. You'll learn how complicated and intriguing book collecting can be. You'll get in on those autions that have buried treasures of books. And maybe, if your lucky, you'll take away a lesson of your own. I learned that like the authors I would like to own hard cover books of the classics and the books I love but in the end I will collect the books I love for what they contain. I can't afford to own all first editions but I can afford to own and experience the stories, the visions and the intriques the writers of books provide. I love my books just as much even if they are not all HC first editions and worth thousands of dollars.
A very gripping hour and ten minutes! The shifting time horizon engages the viewer's mind full time. This definitively establishes itself as a new marker to measure film noirs by.
One thing I'd like to add is that Starship Troopers offered a brilliant preview of what our Army has become in the last 15 years: a successful multiethnic institution. The soldiers in the book come from practically every society on earth. The narrator, for example, is a Tagalog-speaking Filipino named Juan Rico. As military sociologist Charles Moskos has pointed out, the reason the U.S. Army succeeds in getting people from a diverse variety of ethnic groups to work together is because it is NOT multicultural: it's monocultural. It imposes a very distinct militaristic culture upon its recruits. And it offers a unifying goal: victory. (Sports teams are similar.) This offers lessons for the rest of our society, especially our elite universities, which are having so much more trouble dealing with ethnic diversity than the military or college athletic squads.Steve Saile
I'm sorry to say it, but I thought this was book was terrible! I barely make it through the whole book. There was absolutely no plot, unless you count the little girl wanting a dad and not having one a plot. Or maybe the plot was that her mother didn't trust people to not leave her. Either way, they were both able to overcome these "problems" in a matter of two seconds (yes, I'm exaggerating a little bit, but it was a pretty short time). There was a lot of repeating the main character's doubts. I don't know how many times the story had to talk about her fear of people abandoning her, but I just started skimming those parts. If you are looking for a total fluff piece, and that is perfectly fine if you are, then this is the story for you. It really just wasn't what I was hoping for and I was a little disappointed.
If you see yourself as a strong, intelligent woman, DO NOT read this book. The 'heroine' is anything but! Her rationalizations of why not to report key information regarding a murderer to her 'wonderful Texas Ranger' husband, and her reluctance to 'clue' this hunk in on her lucrative business, is beyond any normal persons reasoning. And her teen aged daughters behaviors? Is anyone that foolish?Oh, and can she possible squeeze "Texas Ranger" into anymore sentences...on the SAME page?Normally I consider all books worth reading, but I'll not soon pick up another one of Carla's.
A must see Western in true tradition of Sam Pekinpah. Fantastic cast and plenty of action. If your looking for a love story - forget it. This is a macho guy movie. In the end the Bad Guys are the Good Guys.
Sure, this recording sounds about as good as you will ever hear it, but the music on it is certainly an acquired taste. If I remember correctly, I bought this album when it first came out, listened to it once then gave it away. I was curious to learn if my musical tastes had become more tolerant over the past 45 years but they, apparently, haven't.
it is obvious given the amount of negative votes here that i will receive my share for this negative review. I have purchased all six of Tamara's books and she has a record with me of 4 wins and 2 losses. The Haunted, and Moonfall were extremely good books and I also enjoyed Eternity and Bad Things. Her latest offering, The Forgotten, is one of the most boring and uninspired novels I have read in some time. I really hate to say that but I have to. Please do yourself a favor and spend your money on something else. I won't even loan this book to any of my friends. It is that bad.
The first CD issue of Little Richard's debut album on Epic/Okeh is a must-have for LR collectors and casual fans. Although there are two 1950s tunes (Chuck Willis' "Don't Deceive Me) Please Don't Go" and Barrett Strong's "Money"), there are no arrangements grounded in that era - the production is strictly '60s, and quite progressive for the time. Larry Williams, also of Specialty Records, who had his greatest record successes based upon the barrelhouse beat of his "mentor" in the '50s, became his Producer in the '60s, and with Arranger Arthur Wright, came up with something different - a big band sound with a touch of Motown, a sound which would be echoed later by groups like Blood, Sweat, and Tears. You don't believe me? Play Richard's uptempo "I Need Love" from this collection and then play "Lucretia McEvil". Dig? Case closed. Other acts, including Tom Jones, must have spun these sides more than once.Richard's first session for Epic/Okeh happened in 02-66 and produced the regional and R & B hit "Poor Dog (Who Can't Wag His Own Tail" and "Well" [aka "Well, Alright!"], a Sam Cooke tune devised during the historic 1962 U.K. tour when Sam, Gene Vincent, and a new group called the Beatles got together. (LR had already cut it in early '64 for Specialty but it got put temporarily on the shelf). This session was unlike most others in his first R & R comeback period, '62 to '65, as quality control was obviously a catchphrase. Although he had made several outstanding cuts for Vee Jay and Modern, too many times it seemed as if second-rate was okay and some material was issued which never should have been. Here LR is given notable support. "Poor Dog" was a driving Rock and Soul 4/4 item and "Well" was more Rock and Jazz. They are typical interesting cuts from the session. (Although "Poor Dog" is presented here in a later abbreviated, album version, originally in stereo, now, mystifyingly in mono. What gives?).A later session yielded "(You're My Girl) I Don't Want To Discuss It", a *should-have-been* smash hit if there ever was one. Apparently, the radio station programmers and dee-jays didn't hear what Delaney & Bonnie, Rhinocerous (who also duly noted "I Need Love"), and Rod Stewart heard. It is totally contemporary in approach, yet it sounds fresh and new. From the spoken introduction (probably by Larry Williams), to the toe-tapping rythym and beautifully arranged chorus, it's an instant favorite for anyone who gets a chance to listen."Commandments Of Love", the only other chart-maker from these sessions, is much more "standard", a ballad well delivered, although sounding a bit over-rehearsed - a criticism which could be leveled at almost all the OKeh sessions. Richard sounds interested, sounds professional, but never really digs in emotionally. Another example would be the Willis number. His vocal technique is amazing, the best in the field, but we get the feeling he was looking at his watch while he was cutting it.Another depressing aspect is in a couple of arrangements of Rock and Soul classics - "Land of a Thousand Dances" and "Function at the Junction". It seems that the powers-that-be actually wanted Mr. Penniman, the Rock and Roll Originator, to copy others. It's a tasty repast but the recipe is a little tired. Not a meal fit for...a King.Historians and collectors don't get excited by track number one, the bonus cut, "Get Down With It". It's *not* the Europoean studio version arranged by Reg Guest, as shown. CBS 8116 was released only in Europe, backed by Fats Domino's "Rosemary" and features a guy named Reggie Dwight (aka Elton John). What is pressed is the well-known version from the "Okeh Club" - the popular album "Little Richard's Greatest Hits, Recorded Live". (BGO, can you please correct this on another edition?).
I love the CD can't wait to get his Book he wrote!!!!!!!!!!!!
This CD is some of ICE's best work to date. The whole CD is awesome, every track on here rocks. This is a must purchase for any true ICE fan or any fan of real rap music, this is no cheesy Eminem crap this is the real deal coming from the ICE man!
I'm not a fan of Elaine Cunningham's novels, apart from Counselors and Kings Trilogy, which was very good. I always find her main characters more or less annoying (Danilo Thann and Liriel Baenre, in that order), and that usually takes her traditionally excellent plots and style out of the spotlight. This book has no such characters and it is plain brilliant, speaking in FR terms, of course.The book itself is rather different from other FR novels, since it follows the island kingdom of Evermeet from its very creation to the present time (Faerun's present time, that is). It touches not only every major event in the history of Evermeet, but also in the history of Faerun's elves as a race. (Crown Wars, Moonblades...).The book hasn't got a single main character, but instead it follows a number of important characters through Evermeet's history. Motivations differ greatly from character to character, but all of the "main" characters had an impact on the island kingdom.The book covers a HUGE span of time, and the writer uses that in an excellent way, so you understand the importance of some events considered minor only later on in the book. For example, the way certain items pop up time after time over a 15000 year span.I'm trying to think of something I didn't like in this book, but really nothing is coming into my mind. Really.Whoever liked Tolkien's "Silmarilion" is going to like this book as well. It's not as complex, or to put it more plainly - confusing as J.R.R.'s book, so those who didn't like "Silmarilion" for that reason should give this book a shot. Wizards (or TSR as they were known back then when this book was published) put the writing of this book in real hands.A must-read for every FR fan, and a sincere recommendation to every fantasy reader.
- and the moving camera, which for the last 20 years has been an over-used method of filming almost anything on a big scale, often draws attention to the medium itself when used as it is here, and as much as it is here. Also drawing attention to the medium itself is plenty of disgracefully bad editing/continuity in many places, and a great deal of unnatural voice dubbing, especially of Gandalf and Aragorn.When I heard they were making a film of the book I didn't look forward to it with any pleasant anticipation, even though the book means more to me than any other prose fiction. My fear was that it would be conceived visually much like any other recent 'sword and sorcery' type of film (or horror film given Jackson's track record); that the music would be the usual sort of thing we get in all big films; and that much too recognisable faces would be cast in the leading parts so that suspension of disbelief would be difficult.With the partial exception of the last all my fears were confirmed, and the voice dubbing was much worse than I could have foreseen.And I had been naive enough NOT to have foreseen the weak attempts at comedy for the family audience. What on earth made me think that Tolkien would be spared that?Peter Jackson should have understood as a first principle, the book being the very special kind of book it is - i.e.the most fully imagined 'sub-creation' yet achieved, set in a wholly imaginary ancient time and place, and most especially, a book in which the deep subject is the concern to experience, with fresh appreciation:a) LANGUAGE (which includes the simplicity of Tolkien's prose and all the songs/poems about Middle Earth and its stories),b) SPACE (landscape and geography) along with the simplest and most basic aspects of nature and physical reality like grass and trees and water,c) and the dimension of TIME as revealed by the long history of Middle Earth constantly referred to by Tolkien, and the long journey across the geography of Middle Earth),- that it would need a complete rethink of the way such a film would need to look (and sound) so that it would register somehow as different from other films of adventure made in the last twenty years. I don't mean the costumes or even the design of the sets etc. I mean the way the camera is used, how it moves or, alternatively, observes transparently, what sort of distance it keeps, the rhythm of the editing, and of course the framing. When a film has exactly the same sort of filmic style (the current industry standard), as any other big feature film it is not easy to feel that you are observing what Tolkien called a 'secondary world' (see Tolkien's major essay 'On Faery-Stories in 'Tree and Leaf' or in the new expanded edition on its own).As for the music, regardless of its actual quality as music, it wasn't what is needed to capture the ethos of the book. It should ideally have been 'ancient' and small scale like medieval music or ancient Celtic, Chinese, Japanese, or Indian classical music - not the usual bombastic overblown all-purpose film music which even committed the further idiocy of making the Hobbits Irish - I suppose Shore had the half-baked notion of leprechauns in his head.If they had to commission a full orchestral score for this film they could, in view of the ambitiousnes of the project as a whole, at least have chosen a distinguished composer of serious music who would have come up with something different and on more of a level with the book - Robin Holloway, Colin Matthews, Maxwell Davies, James MacMillan, Thomas Ades, or even Birtwistle perhaps. There was a time when it was properly understood that a film of this importance would be given a score by one of the leading composers of the day, a Korngold, Walton, Bax or Vaughan Williams. If ever a film called for a return to this practice this was it.Well at least most of the casting was acceptable although whatever was gained by heavily disguising McKellen was lost by close-miking his voice and having him mutter under his breath in a way that normally signifies stream-of consciousness interior thoughts. Just as all recent films use far too many close-ups so they also rely too much on post-production voice dubbing, or sound engineering, to create false drama and hypnotic immersion (at least for those susceptible to such methods).This compounds the problem created by the close-ups and makes it even more difficult to experience Tolkien's 'sub-creation' (a term Tolkien used for his kind of secondary world) as anything different from ordinary primary reality.There was one exception to the generally good casting: Frodo, who apart from anything else, was at least 10 years too young, even making allowances for the longevity of Hobbits. In other cases it was more of a case of the actors being encouraged by the director to play it for self-conscious comedy, something which is depressingly the case in almost all commercial cinema apart from gangster films. But I would have much preferred a completely unknown actor in the key role of Gandalf, and in the other important role of Bilbo - and I think they would probably have made a better job of it.There were of course many good things about this and especially the other films. Some of the casting was spot on: Aragorn, Boromir, Arwen and Eowyn (such fine noble women). I had no problem with the design of the weapons and costumes although I was disappointed with the art direction of many scenes because of very average framing (compare it with the 1960 film 'The Alamo' for example, which in addition had a magnificent and perfectly appropriate musical score). Of course with the camera moving about so much, and so many close-ups of faces, actually framing a shot was probably the last thing on Jackson's mind, or on the mind of his second-unit director.I found the big set pieces quite impressive although some of the 'monsters' were too big - as usual the film industry can't resist going over the top.But I was not at all impressed by the way landscape was used, and indeed not used, especially in the first part where there was very little sense of the long eventful journey through a slowly changing landscape, or of what should have been at least in the first stages a very English landscape. Even the extended version didn't add to this sense as I had hoped - the Sign Of The Prancing Pony is reached all too soon. Language and landscape and the more subtle aspect of time are the most important ingredients of the book and sadly landscape and time came off as poorly as language. But at least there were a couple of magical scenes in which Elvish was spoken, with sub-titles on screen. In those scenes the magic of the book and the otherness of Middle Earth suddenly shone out and made my skin tingle.I was also irritated by the frequent sloppy continuity due to bad editing within scenes taking too many short cuts, and deliberately oversaturated colours in many of the scenes of the Shire in the first film. This first of the three films was the weakest for several reasons although many people like myself will feel that in the book as a whole it is by far the most important part of the story, and the part we want to re-read most.Leaving aside Gollum of course, I can only single out one male performance as especially well judged and convincing and that is SEAN BEAN's as Boromir. He was so impressive it came as no surprise that just after the release of this film he appeared on the London stage as Macbeth.Ridley Scott's 'Kingdom Of Heaven' is a far superior film, and at least until its last 25 minutes or so, even his 'Robin Hood' is also a better piece of film making in many ways, but there is plenty of bad editing in the action scenes, some clumsy voice dubbing of Russell Crow which may be bad 'Voice acting', and the music is even worse. Unfortunately I have only been able to find one example in the last 15 years of a commercial 'historical' film with a decent score, and that is Besson's 'Joan of Arc'. In 'Robin Hood' there was far less reliance on close-ups which is a lazy way of directing a film, and instead of these intimacies (especially inappropriate for epic narratives like Tolkien's) we get some real effort to create some context and ethos with some impressive framing of images. You cannot create the special magic of a secondary world with close-ups and close-miking of voices - there has to be some distance.If you have read the book and love it then I would advise you to stick with the image you have in your head and not to see the film. It is a GREAT book, it is not a great film and in no way did it capture the essential ethos of the book. But perhaps the scenes in Elvish with Liv Tyler, and the last battle and death of Boromir are worth seeing if you ask a friend to show them to you and spare you the rest.Jackson may have been the right person to produce this film but he wasn't the right person to direct it, or be in charge of post-production.
WOW!! I have just finished this book and the first thing that comes to my mind is WOW!!! It was great! The characters were strong, and the plot was full of twists. There are only two reasons why this book got only four stars from me. The first and probably the biggest is Chance and Fancy's relationship. They had great chemistry, but their constant sniping at each other got a little old. And two, I was really dissapointed when Gil was killed. I would have loved to read a book about him. He was easy to love. Overall I'd say this was one of the better books, by far! I strongly reccomend it!!!
I gave this movie 2 stars; but if it wasn't for the decent special effects, I would have given it 1 star. Why? Because of all the false teaching regarding Creation and the End of the World. Aliens did not put us on Earth; aliens will not save any of us when it is destroyed. Jesus is the beginning and the end; the Almighty, the Creator. There is much evidence from the Bible that Jesus will return soon. Unfortunately, movies like Knowing and 2012 are spreading lies about the End and other matters.Read what the Bible says about the End. Make no mistake; you will know when it happens, and you will know that God is bringing the End (it will not be some natural or man-made disaster). Take a moment and read 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10, and Revelation 6:14-17. View my profile; visit my website. May God have mercy on your soul while it is still the day of salvation.
I HAVE READ EVERY ONE OF CARL WEBERS BOOK....AND THE MAN IS AN EXCELLENT EXCELLENT WRITER....FROM THE FIRST PAGE YOU ARE CAUGHT INTO THE BOOK.....I READ HIS LATEST "SO YOU CALL YOURSELF A MAN" IN TWO DAYS......THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ...ITS LIKE WATCHING A MOVIE..WAITING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT...I TOLD EVERYBODY ABOUT THIS BOOK AND THEY ALL AGREE....I CANT WAIT TO READ HIS NEXT BOOK....CARL HAS BECOME MY ALL TIME FAVORITE WRITER...THE BOOK IS EXCELLENT!!!!!! HAD ME SCREAMING AT THE SHOCKING DISCOVERIES...AND LAUGHING......THIS IS THE BEST BOOK
What a great song! I grew up in the 80s, when all the hairbands were trying to copy stuff like this. I love the entire album, as it reminds me of Nugent, Foghat, Lynyrd Skynryd, Zeppelin, Purple, AC/DC, Sabbath and most of the better rockers of the 70s. It's a total hard rockin classic.
This is truly one of my favorites. Quirky,imaginitive,and sometimes poetic lyrics keep you interested. I have recommended this cd to several people and even the skeptical listeners are converted. I prefer the ballads on this cd...James is wonderful; I could listen to this song over and over again and not get tired of it. I have had this cd for several years and every time I listen to it, it gets better. I recently purchased the new Huffamoose cd (I wanna be your pants) and I was expecting it to produce the same feelings; however, I definitely prefer &quot;We've Been Had...&quot;I would recommend this to anyone. It really is a hidden gem.
During the Nazi Era, this book was the most un-read bestseller in Europe. Lots of people purchased the volume, but very few took the time to read it.Therein lies a tragedy; Hitler had outlined his entire diabolical program before it was carried out. In Mein Kampf, Hitler's evil blueprint was laid out in detail, but nobody knew much about it because they didn't take the time to read it.This book is putrid and evil, but revealing.
I had very bad experiences using the previous generation of Energizer 2500mAh rechargeable NiMH cells (circa 2005). They started out strong but soon developed rapid-self-discharge problem, and became useless after just a few dozen charge/discharge cycles. This product offered here ("2 Pack of Rechargeable AA NiMH Battery Retail Pack - 4-pack") is actually the NEW version. Energizer has finally discontinued the '2500mAh' series back in 2010, presumably due to massive complaints. All the new Energizer rechargeable AA cells on the market now are rated at only '2300mAh'.I have tested four of those new cells, using the Discharge/Refresh function of myLa Crosse BC-900charger/analyzer. Here are my findings:- Fresh out of the package, those cells hold an average of 330mAh, or just 14% of the full capacity.- After fully charging them for the first time, they hold an average of 1040mAh.- After two more discharge/charge cycles, the average capacity improved to 2340mAhBased on the above observations, I can conclude that those 'New' Energizer cells are just ordinary NiMH cells with lower capacity. They are not the LSD (low-self-discharge) type pioneered bySANYO eneloopin 2006. This is very disappointing, because other name-brand battery makers have already introduced similar LSD products, such as theRayovac HybridandDuracell Pre Charged. In contrast, Mr. Energizer Bunny simply 'rolled back' its battery technology to circa 2004.On the new package it also advertises "Charge up to 250 more times". But that's compared to previous generation Energizer 2500mAh cells, which has a rated lifespan of only 250 cycles (actual lifespan is much shorter). Most name-brand LSD cells are rated for 500-1000 cycles, withsecond-generation Sanyo eneloopcells being the apex at 1500 cycles.In summary, those so-called 'New' Energizer NiMH cells have capacity just slightly higher than that of LSD NiMH cells (typically measured at 2100mAh), yet they do not offer the advantage of lower self discharge rate. As of this writing, this product is priced even higher than 2nd-gen Sanyo eneloop. So it is just a bad deal.The only positive thing I can say about those 2300mAh Energizer cells is: they don't self-discharge as badly as previous generation of 2500mAh cells. But that's not saying much.
...that you ever decided to write this novel.I have long enjoyed Weir's popular histories and, in fact, consider her one of the better popular historians. While the Tudor era is my 'specialty' and I have many books by 'serious' historians, I have ALL of Weir's just for the pleasure they give me. I use popular histories whenever I'm interested in an era new to me. If a popular historian piques my interest, I'll go on to the 'hard stuff'. But, Alison is just so much fun to read that I buy her books for pleasure and not just knowledge!*Innocent Traitor* could have been wonderful. Instead it has to reach up to achieve mediocrity. Weir's strange use of language keeps whomping me in the face with a dead fish and breaking the flow of the story.Instead of choosing all-modern or all-Tudor English, she uses mostly-modern with a now-and-again 'methinks' type word or phrase. It's most disconcerting. Ex. Queen Jane Seymour says, "His (Henry's) obsessive and pathetic need for this child to be a boy is more than I can cope with." (Pg. 7, Ballentine USA edition) Not only would the queen NOT have said 'obsessive and pathetic' or 'more than I can cope with' she would never even have thought these words. Like most women, Jane Seymour had been raised to believe that a woman's only valid calling was to produce male heirs with the barely-secondary conviction that women were created to 'cope with' whatever men chose to throw at them. And the entire nation understood Henry's need to have a son. At that point in history and with his daughter Elizabeth's reign yet to come, no one thought England could survive as a nation with a female ruler. So, these 'thoughts' of Jane Seymour's are a glaring and annoying anachronism; just one of many.Yet later, Frances and Henry Grey 'make merry' when having sex. Sheesh!The story is certainly riveting, and Weir does an admirable job of laying the various political motivations out, with clarity, to a public possibly putting a toe into the Tudor era. That is, of course, the strong foundation her being an historian had to lay, even with the fictional set dressing. I think that Weir is incapable of making a hash of the historicity of her story.I wish she had left it at that.
Despite a few dated and tasteless scenes, this movie sustains very well over 30 years later. The script is brilliant, as is the direction, and Zero Mostel's acting, though bordering on cartoonish here and there, is astonishing.Since the Marx Brothers' "Duck Soup" and W.C. Fields' "It's A Gift", both from 1934, there are very few film comedies which even approach "Classic" status. My personal favorites, along with the three just mentioned, are "So Fine" with Jack Warden as a desperate garment industry Manager, and "The Freshman", with Marlon Brando, sending up his "Godfather" role.What makes this picture so entertaining is the twisted plot - you really can't see how, or decide when the demented scheme (of raising too much money for a terrible Broadway play and leaving for Rio when it's time to pay the investors) will blow up in the faces of the milquetoast Accountant Gene Wilder or the has-been Producer Zero Mostel. And just when you feel spent from laughing, a huge opening night production number of "Springtime For Hitler", with a goose-stepping chorus line and Busby Burkeley effects, is presented.Yes, a few segments have not traveled well through time, specifically, the scenes mocking the "gay" Valet or ogling the bubble-headed blonde Secretary; the very entertaining Hitler "audition" by the failed Beat Generation follower turned Flower Child Dick Shawn also doesn't quite register by now, but altogether this film must be considered as essential viewing.
This movie was made in 1985, but has kept its edge for 25 years. A TV journalist has to choose between ratings and ethics in a case involving a teacher charged with having sexual relations with a young student. Tensions mount as the issue becomes a lot more complicated than anyone ever expected.Surprisingly effective and not the exploitive schlock typical of this genre. Rated R, probably for thematic reasons.
Hope Sandoval belongs to a growing sorority of women who are choosing to express the quiter, darker, creative side of life. Among them are Lucinda Williams, Bjork, Natalie Merchant, Lori Carson,Patty Griffin and to a lesser extent Beth Orton and Heather Duby. It absolutely amazes me that each of these brillant and talented artists have taken breaks from their pop origins and received heavy handed criticism for making records that are &quot;not upbeat&quot; and &quot;too serious.&quot; Certainly speaks to our societies addiction to happiness. These brave women have left the status quo and ventured off in the areas rarely uncharted by artists addicted to the catchy pop, upbeat HOOK -- god love them! Well there are plenty of hooks on Hope Sandoval's lovely dark valentine &quot;Bavarian Fruit Bread.&quot; The uninitiated must just challenge themselves a little harder to hear them initially. Just listen to &quot;On the Low,&quot; &quot;Butterfly Mornings&quot; and &quot;Charlotte.&quot; Sandoval et al are asking their audience to consider the other options available to being human. Happiness is wonderful but as temporary as all the other emotions available to us. The dark side should not be feared, it is where creativity is borne-- settle in and let Hope Sandoval and the sounds of &quot;Bavarian Fruit Bread&quot; take you there.
I can't say why I decided to read this. I'm not a big fan of urban fantasy, so I never could really get into the Dresden books (although the one I tried was certainly witty and well-written -- this is clearly about my tastes, not about the writing). Nor am I a big fan of fantasy based on Rome. However, read it I did, and I found it to be a quite entertaining fantasy novel. How entertaining? I ordered the rest of the books in the series and read them straight through, including the one that's only out in hardcover. Oh, and now I am chomping at the bit for this fall's release of the final book in the series.Want to know about the plot? There are other reviews that detail that, so I refer you to them. What captured my attention was that combination of what it takes to make a good fantasy novel: fluent writing, interesting believable characters, and good solid world-building.It helped that the first series of events in this book both surprised me and (in retrospect) could not have gone any other way, which promised strong plotting. Indeed, the entire book has a good and interesting premise explored in a powerfully developed plot. The characters intrigued me, both the good guys and the bad guys, and most of all the ones who are somewhere in between.The magic system is interesting although I think it's probably the place where someone who wanted to poke holes could. The world is believably drawn. The events of the book are both complete in the book and clearly part of a larger pattern.And the best part of all, this very strong and enjoyable book is by far the weakest of the five so far published in this series. I'm so glad I found it.
Wow, what a great book! Very few authors develop all of their characters so thoroughly that you feel like you know them. The plot took many twists and turns and how people responded wasn't exactly what you thought would happen, but more realistically what would have happened and I loved it. Another thing I loved was that no one in the story was entirely good, or entirely bad. They were human with strengths and weaknesses. I will definitely be reading more by this author.
If you haven't heard this type of music, it's funny. Quite humorious to hear old rap songs turned into lounge music. But gets old quick. Good for an easy joke at social settings.
Charlotte Church's latest offering Enchantment, is anything but enchanting. It's too egregiously eclectic, with classical selections, Broadway pieces that were once favorites until she sang them, and songs from a hodgepodge of other genres. She's a musical dilettante on this album and it ends up giving one a really bad headache. Charlotte also relies far too heavily on instrumentation on this album, instead of allowing it to complement her singing. This loud instrumentation, that's almost blatant at times, drowns out Charlotte Church's voice on several important parts in the songs, signaling that Charlotte just couldn't sing up to par. She overwhelms and oversings such delicate songs as The Flower Duet and just finds herself trying too hard on songs like Bali Ha'i. The instrumentation of Carrickfergus really leaves something to be desired. Haba&ntilde;era is perhaps Charlotte's brightest moment on the album, a brief flickering light though, as she fudges words because she simply hasn't yet mastered Latin-based languages. The consequent roughness of Enchantment would seem like something one would find on a debut album, not her third. Charlotte may like to think she's in the ranks of stunning Sarah Brightman (which she tries just to hard to be like), but she comes off as a copy-cat and inept on this album. Perhaps on her next album, she should try infusing her songs with emotion, putting her talent to actual use, or, solving this problem entirely, write some of her own material instead of reusing everyone elses. Try Sarah Brightman's Classics or La Luna to calm your passion for classic songs, but not Charlotte Church's disappointing Enchantment.
Daisy Suckley was a cousin of FDR. She spent a great deal of time with him prior to the Presidency and again from 1941 to 1945, after Missy LeHand had a debilitating stroke.Daisy died in 1995 and her diaries--unread until her death--were made into a book called "Closest Companion," which is a treasure trove of FDR info. Among the details: FDR told Daisy--in vague terms--about the Manhattan Project!I reference "Closest Companion" because in it, Daisy tells about watching "Gabriel Over the White House" with FDR prior to his being inaugerated. She says in her diary that she would like to see a President do the things that the President does in this film.Nevermind that he may have overstepped Constitutional boundaries...the President in this movie does something about the problems being faced by America in 1932/33.And just maybe this movie nudged FDR forward a bit...
I recently read this wonderful book for a course on Narrative Theory. I have not read _Jane Eyre_, though my wife reminds me I have seen at least parts of two versions of that book on film. As a consequence, I read this (despite the knowledge gained reading the forward) without the &quot;benefit&quot; of viewing it as a prequel to Ms. Bronte's work.Standing alone, on its own, the book is a challenging story of interpersonal clashes, misunderstandings, fear, and loathing all rolled into a sort of gothic romance. Ms. Rhys has done a wonderful job of character development, of manipulating narrative devices, to develop her personal insight to private desires, fears, and madness.For those who have read or are going to read it, I have two questions: first, given Antoinette is the narrator of the story, at what time in her life is the story being told? Second, what makes so many readers name Antoinette's husband &quot;Mr. Rochester&quot;?
I will say this movie is no lonesome dove but it is a fine movie it dose go through a few historical events (Although these events where fictionalized and the time lines don't add up) and it is a good western. if your a fan of the lonesome dove movies and books you will enjoy this. This movie introduces you to the hero's of the lonesome dove series and you learn why there are and end up the way they did. It is a exciting movie but be warned it is long.
"Riviera Rendezvous" alone was worth the price of the entire CD! I also really liked "Kinda Kinky". The songs are just so cool and different than anything else that's out there, musically.
I can deal with:1. Mary Jane being a neighbor of the Parkers (what???)2. Green Goblin's Transformer face & costume3. Ohh yes, the terrible CGI...But Mary Jane falling off the bridge? next time read the comic, Mr. Raimi, or you could watch X-Men (I have to say that I'm not big fan of them) or Batman and learn how a good comic book based movie should be done. Take this from a 22+ year reader of Spider-man......to quote J. Jonah Jameson (BTW him was excellent) from the movie: "crap...crap...mega crap". If you still want to see this, erase from your memory all your existing knowledge of Spider-man.
"Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap" Gal 6:7I open this review with scripture. Why you ask? WELL EVERY Christian movie ever made is a mockery of God. When Christians make a movie they never think of how to entertain they just try to drill the message in. The Point of Christian films should be toencourage people to live as Christ did. Not Judge others, accept people for who they are while not ignoring their sinful nature.Christian movies seldom give this message and it's made worse by drilling home personal opinions of the ministry behind these movies. Courageous is a fine example of this. The message of this film "BE A MAN BY FORCING CHRIST ON TO YOUR KIDS" This message is delivered through a melodramatic poorly edited sermon near the end of the film. It's less a Christian Sermon and looks more like when Hitler gave his speeches in Nazi Germany.Christians, some the mildness sheep with blind faith, Will love this others will see this as what it is. A Poor attempt to make a GOOD Christian movie.We have separation of Church and state...we also apparently have a separation of Church and entertainment.
Above all, besides being incredibly beautiful eye-candy, "Casshern" is a deeply spiritual film. It is a meditation on human nature, innocence, war and the origins of evil. It cuts right to the heart of what really matters in life and what truly lies in the deepest soul of each person. I was enthralled for most of the film, disgusted at some of it, and in tears during the final scenes. The contrast between the remembered happiness of simpler times and the twisted anger and hatred evinced throughout the rest of the movie was striking and heart-wrenching, especially in the implication that it is that simple love and joy that truly lasts in eternity, rendering the endless war and greed and cruelty on earth ultimately meaningless. I highly recommend this movie.
In metal circles I've noticed the tendency to criticize and ignore this exellent disc by Dismember. I can't imagine why. As far as I'm concerned, it's their best album.The aggression is palpable from the first riffs of "I Saw Him Die" through to the end. In addition to the strong level of musicianship here, the songs share a strong contextual link. Every one deals with issues of warfare and (of course) the resultant slaughter. These may be typical topics for death metal musicians, but this is one of the few times I could feel the music crashing out of my speakers convey the harshness of warfare. Buy this & enjoy the brutality from your covered little cove, worm.Dismember the virgins!
First I have to say I'm a big fan right now of the Flat Belly Diet but anytime science actually backs a new diet plan rather than just some celebrity or marketing dollars, I try it out as it's part of my job.I began this diet 2 weeks ago and I have had high blood pressure since I was about 20. I went through all kinds of tests because doctors and specialists were convinced there was something massively wrong with me as I weighed 115 lbs, was a vegetarian, and had blood pressure so bad I was vomiting....they couldn't believe I had high blood pressure sorbet thought something was failing internallyNope, no reason...just genetic. Since then, I've gotten it down with cardio but when I don't have time for cardio, like recently, it goes up again. I have been able to stop taking 2 of the strongest meds I've always taken but I was still having to take diuretics to get rid of the salt in my body to lower my blood pressure as it has NEVER been normal for decades.Until now.But I'll get to all that.Because you'll ALSO lose weight with this. And that ALSO lowers it more...you'll have great energy and never be hungry as well.So is it another fad? Actually the principles of this, similar to the Flat Belly Diet, are some of the most proven philosophies and largest studies of obesity that make it up in recent years. Yes, it's in medical materials rather than magazines.However news magazines like it too.It was just rated the #1 healthiest diet in US News and World Report.Over ALL diets...Jenni Craig, Nutrisystem, anything.This was the diet used by the USDA for its health guidelines called "MY PLATE" which updated the food pyramid.This diet is endorsed by the American Heart Association.Here are the components:Type of foodFirst set of numbers: Number of servings for 1600 - 3100 Calorie dietsSecond set of numbers: Servings on a 2000 Calorie dietGrains and grain products(include at least 3 whole grain foods each day)6 - 127 - 8Fruits4 - 64 - 5Vegetables4 - 64 - 5Low fat or non fat dairy foods2 - 42 - 3Lean meats, fish, poultry1.5 - 2.52 or lessNuts, seeds, and legumes3 - 6 per week4 - 5 per weekFats and sweets2 - 4limitedCan this be adapted for vegans and vegetarians? Easily. With lean proteins replacing the lean meats.Now here's why it works. These components give you the tools to keep you full but specifially have been found to reduce visceral fat faster. Yes, Even Dr. Oz has done two shows on it. Monounsaturated fats such as the nuts and seeds actually help you lose weight if part of your daily diet but within the desired 1600 calorie range.Whole grains are a big part. Numerous studies have shown fiber and whole and unprocessed foods increases weight loss and helps blood pressure. In fact, some studies have shown that Americans actually haven't increased their caloric intake since the spike of obesity, they have simply increased their prs=eservatives and processed foods. These studies have resulted in even major diet systems making changes to encourage whole foods, such as Weight Watchers. By whole grains, this does not mean "wheat bread" it means "whole wheat bread" and no preservatives. Wheat is no different than white...the nutrients are stripped out, it's just not bleached. Big difference. Wheat is extraordinarily healthy.Do increasing your fruits and veggies really help? It will lower your risk of all major health issues by extraordinary amounts. And high blood pressure, stroke, cancers are all part of that. Undisputed. Better yet, low glycemic veggies that are not starchy take as many calories to digest them as are in them so you stay full but eat less calories and can do so with more energy and faster weight loss and faster results in getting your heart healthy.In fact they say you WILL lower your blood pressure in 14 days.Yes it works. I'd like to see monounsaturated fats play actually a larger part because the "good fats", for me and in so many studies, will be healthy in this calorie range even at more servings (but not exceeding the calorie range) but they know more than me and they are in there and this can give you YEARS longer and very healthy ones at that. It's back by study after study, it's not a fad, and it works.Note: I had excellent lowered blood pressure and lowered weight but I do not have high cholesterol so I personally cannot give you MY results on that, however, my best friend who has it got off of her medication for cholesterol. However, it took her a month rather than 2 weeks to do so. But she also lost 16 lbs the first month and said she wasn't hungry. I did not have those kind of weight loss results but I'm pretty little to begin with.
When I read this to little kids, they say &quot;That's not the way it goes! Tell it right!&quot; But that's the whole point, and I love it! The non-linear structure, the way the stories overrun the pages, it's just sheer joy. I have shared this book with many friends, and I have given all my copies away. I have trouble keeping this one on my shelf.
I bought this to replace a Black & Decker blender that was horrible and broke. This one is a vast improvement. Makes short work of ice for smoothies. I've owned about 6 blenders, this one's the best so far.
I got this for my oldest daughter because I had bought a ringtailed FIESTA brand lemur at the store at the zoo for my youngest daughter. We looked through 300 pages of toys and Marina picked this out. VERY SOFT VERY PRETTY ANIMAL! WOW! Really exotic. The fur is gorgeous colors and the eyes are mesmerizing golden pools of light! I am thoroughly impressed with the quality. Marina LOVES her red ruffed lemur! Loves it!
With all the fans I've bought lately, I'm becoming something of an authority on the subject. That said, for its purpose, this is a perfect fan. What makes it so?It's QUIET. I can put it on my beside table at low or even medium speed and barely hear it. Sometimes I have to look to make sure it's on.It pivots diagonally. Oscillation is provided by the front vent which turns, so the fan itself doesn't move. Oscillator can be turned off if desired.Mounts on a wall or table. It does have a tipover switch, so locating it where it works best can be a challenge, but not a problem.Has a two hour timer or run continuously. Three speeds. Low gives you a gentle breeze and is as close to silent as you can get. High gives you a nice breeze you can feel across a room.It's a good value. You won't find a better fan for less. I don't think you'll find a better fan of this size at any price.I liked this fan so much I bought another, and will probably buy a third. In summer it is the perfect bedroom fan. In winter it moves warm air around the house, or pushes warm air down from a high ceiling.I should disclose that when I got my first one, either the tipover switch was defective, or I was doing something wrong. Regardless, Amazon quickly replaced it at their expense.Sometimes you just are really satisfied with a common product that normally you wouldn't even notice. I came upon this product by chance (in the Gold Box deals), and am delighted with this purchase. Highly recommended.
dude this movie was HILARIOUS!!! its about this dude, and he couldnt find his car
I've been listening to synthpop ever since it happened. It was usually a UK/Euro phenomenon. But by the early 80s there were US synthpop bands like Our Daughters Wedding that were playing catch up to their UK counterparts. By the late 80s synthpop was moribund when this band appeared. I passed them over in the day. But I'd picked up a (shudder) Madonna Tribute album on Cleopatra a few years back just to get the [not worth it] Heaven 17 cover of "Holiday" but when I listened to the disc, INSOC's cover of "Express Yourself" just popped off of the disc. Their take of the Madonna tune was not unlike their sound on their big hit "What's On Your Mind." It just hit me a lot better in the 21st century, so I resolved to get some INSOC and listen. That tune sounds better now and being followed by the superb "Tomorrow," I was sure I was going to have a new toy. Then came an Abba cover that added nothing after which came "Repitition," the dreaded mid-80s synth ballad featuring that soporific mellow electric piano with reverb keyboard preset [probably from a hated DX-7] that I DESPISE SO and I'm happy to dock this fair-to-middling effort a full star. The rest is listenable but inconseqential American late-80s synthpop. Maybe a best of would work better for me.
I loved 7.0, but 8.0 can't do anything... worse than the crash prone QuickClean 4.0!
This book was truly a work of art. Everything just seemed to fit right into place. In Interview with the vampire, Lestat was portrayed as sort of the villian if you will. Anne takes us way before the time of Louis and Claudia. Revealing the history of Enkil and Akasha, The legend of the great Marius, Gabrielle (I do hope I spelt that correctly), Lestat's mother who on the verge of death was made into a vampire by Lestat. His first creation if you will. The history of Armand and how he came to be and last but not least about Magnus who created Lestat, left him with a great fortune and flung himself into the flames. This is art.
It's a take a break, change your life, do what you gotta do feel good book. Frankie is a stressed exec who is so dedicated to her job she takes her work on vacation with her. Randy is a beach bum whose main goal in life is to avoid responsibility of any kind. These two get together and manage to teach each other something about living life to the fullest and being true to yourself. The real joy of this book though was the ending. Ms. Bond didn't take the easy way out, she took both of her characters and made them grow as people, beyond the relationship. I would definitely recommoned this book to the romance reader who is tired of heavy angst and social issues and just wants to have fun. This is a great light-hearted romantic read, perfect for summer or any vacation.
EnthrallingMesmorizingUnbelievableMagicalSoothingCreative beyond beliefThis CD is more Eastern (Asia, India, Himalayas, etc.) than Southwestern, but don't let that stop you. Buy it, love it, enjoy it, it's one of a literal handful of CDs that I would NOT be without, in my life.
My player was overheating because I was putting it in my sports bra while I ran, this did the trick perfectly!
I'm grateful I found this at my local library so I could listen to it before buying it -- I mean NOT buying it. Lucinda sounds drunk or stoned. She's off key, her phrasing and pacing is bad, and the whole thing is painful to listen to. Like the other thumbs down reviewers, I have no idea why anyone thought this concert should have been made available commercially. Save your money and stick to her studio recordings.
I just received this set, and have only watched Superchick and Galaxina, both prints or transfers I'd give 4/5, Superchick, was about the style and kind of movie I was expecting from this set, but Galaxina such a rare treat, to have a good print of this film in my collection I feel so rich. I doubt any exceptional or unexceptional B sci-fi like this will ever go to blu ray, and will probably go out of print in the next few years. This is easily one of if not the best cheesy B scifi flicks ever, get this set!!!I've watched a few more of the movies now, and I am happy to report Mill Creek has finally stepped up their game all the transfers are good to very good, and complete, not like their previous bargain sets poor transfers, cuts, and sound drops, also there are no annoying logos in the corner of the films :)) I'm very pleased with this set, Hustler Squad was a great flick too, nice price, great deal.
not as nice as it looked on the site. Way too big for anyones wrist too. It keeps rolling around and does not stay clipped
I really don't care what your thoughts are on the album. I personally think it is one of the most metal albums of all time. Dark, cold, and emotional. What more can you expect????I purchased this album the day it was released, it's a classic release. I only hope future releases from Antimatter can hold up...Their earlier stuff is great as well, different, but good. This album is like a pure speedball of emotion...buy it now!
There is no doubt that this work had one of the greatest, if not the greatest impact on western literature.Name any book and you can see elements in which that book is portrayed within The Odyssey.The story takes place some time after the Iliad in which suitors overrun the home of the brave tactician Odysseus. His son, Telemakhos has no recollection of his father since the day he was born was the day that he left to fight the Trojan War. The beautiful wife of Odysseus, Penelope remains steadfast and faithful even though her home is flooded with the most eligible of bachelors. His son had grown to manhood but still not a true man since he grew up without his father guidance. At that time, Athena comes to him in form of a human to help him on his way and suggest he leaves to find news of his father and to be out of harms way because the suitors plan to attack him.During this time his father is trapped on the island of the beautiful nymph which he "reluctantly" beds and but is soon freed by the god Hermes.The rest tells the tales of how Odysseus returns home. Odysseus tells the story that takes place beforehand through storytelling.Odysseus is the pinnacle of Greek heroes. But his character does have it flaws. Odysseus also willingly beds down with not one but two beautiful goddesses during his travels and expresses little remorse for his infidelities - though he rails against the suitors who are trying to capture his wife. But he is blessed with both strength and brains. There is no better &quot;improviser&quot; or &quot;strategist&quot; in Greek mythology, though the label attached is often &quot;cunning&quot; or &quot;deceiver&quot;; indeed, many Greeks saw Odysseus' habit of lying as a vice and a weakness. His penchant for disguise complements his ability to make up plausible stories about his background. Although Odysseus' ingenuity comes across as his chief weapon, his Achilles' heel of sorts is the frequency with which he falls victim to temptation and makes grave tactical errors, none more so than when adding insult to injury to Polyphemos and revealing his true name. Still, Odysseus is aware of this flaw, and bids his men to tie him up when they pass by the Seirenes, the paragons of temptation. By the end of his journey, he has learned to resist temptation, willingly suffering abuse by the suitors to meet his eventual goal of destroying them.At the end, (not to give it away) poetic justice is served. But you knew that.
The title pretty much sums it up for me. This book was interesting. I wound up liking the murdered couple and got rather tired of of Mr. Corey's constant smart alek remarks even though they could be very funny at times. The plot has an unusual twist that Mr. Corey eventually figures out even though there are numerous people who try to stop him.The government thinks that the murdered couple has stolen a killer virus from them and goes on the usual CYA ( Cover Your Asses) but at the same time tries to prevent John Corey from solving the real mystery.
This book is an excellent glimpse of what life is like in the modern American military for the civilian reader who may not know the first thing about the intricacies of military bureaucracy, acronymese and other forms of military-speak, and the like. Quite simply, and quite at odds with 99% of what is written about the military (flattering or negative) he simply seems to get it, to have some understanding of the men and women who choose to wear the uniform, their world view, and why so many choose to continue serving despite danger, protracted and repeated deployments overseas, etc. In this, the book is wonderfully refreshing.One reviewer expressed a negative opinion of the book because the author admits he tends to like the people he interviews and travels among. So what? Kaplan himself assesses issues of objectivity even as he discusses his fondness for the American officers and NCOs he meets. It is rather refreshing to see a journalist admit his bias and place himself in the narrative rather than cling to the fiction that any human being can be truly neutral and objective, hiding real motives and agendas behind a facade of false impartiality. So long as an author is forthcoming about his personal opinions and background I can only see the narrative enriched, rather than flawed, by such candor.For any reader who wants to understand American foreign policy and the role of the military this is a reasonable book, though there are better. But, for a reader who wants to understand the mid-level officers and sergeants who are called on to enact American foreign policy and, in some cases, create and define it this book is as good a read as you will find. You may or may not like what Kaplan has to say (and even more so the officers and NCOs he quotes in the book), but if you are not a member of the US military you will learn something about how the men and women in uniform view the world and their place in it.Addendum: In reading over other reviews of this book, I'm struck by two intriguing, but, in my opinion utterly wrong notions.First, are those reviewers who fault Kaplan for favoring foreign involvement over the defense of the continental United States. This is simply ill-informed isolationism. Preventing the next regional war before it begins by deploying a few dedicated and veteran troops is not skimping on the defense of the United States or its interests, it is the absolute antithetis of the critics' claims.Second, one reviewer claims that the lesson of the last 40 years is that special operations forces cannot win wars by themselves. They certainly cannot win every war scenario, but the belief that they cannot win wars is the same thinking that transformed Vietnam into a decade long bleeding wound as Big Army thinkers found the absolute worst way to fight that war, ignoring the historical value of special operations and unconventional warfare in both American history as well as our foreign allies such as the British in Malaya. The reason Americans do not reflect back on our war in El Salvador is because a handful of Special Forces personnel, tied in with indigenous forces, won that war quietly and without requiring an ordeal on the order of Vietnam.Concerning both these topics, Kaplan seems far more coherent and far more in tune with reality than the critics.
"The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be. Our feeblest contemplations of the Cosmos stir us -- there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if a distant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest of mysteries."Carl Sagan was an amazing man. He was a Pulitzer-prize winning author and director of the Laboratory for Planetary Studies at Cornell University. He was an American astronomer, astrobiologist, and highly successful science popularizer. He pioneered exobiology and promoted the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence. Even so, I believe his largest achievement was in his capability to convey his ideas, which allowed so many people to better understand the cosmos. His award-winning series, first broadcast in 1980, covered a wide range of scientific subjects including the origin of life and a perspective of our place in the universe.Conceived and hosted by Dr. Sagan, Cosmos dragged science out of the classroom and into real life, using a then-revolutionary mix of on-location segments shot around the world, cutting edge special effects, computer graphics, historical recreations and more to explain intricate, often abstract concepts to the average person. Sagan's phrases are carefully chosen, his analogies focused and fascinating.

These are included at the end of several episodes. It is amazing, however, how few revisions and updates this series needs, as the science contained in these episodes is still hugely valid today.Cosmos is presented in newly enhanced and remastered video and looks great, even on my Sony 36" HD screen. The show's color palette is vibrant and balanced, the result of the color-correcting done on the series specifically for this release, and there is minimal grain and debris in the print. The restoration quality is remarkable considering this series is over 26 years old. Occasionally new images from the Hubble telescope are inserted into the episodes to replace artist renderings from 1980, and they look spectacular. Also, new 3D animation was incorporated into some segments, and occasionally more recent video material was added; for example, footage of the Exxon Valdez oil spill now appears in a segment on ecological disasters.The audio is impressive as well. A new 5.1 mix, supervised by Cosmos sound designer Kent Gibson, was created from the original mono audio stems. The grand musical score benefits enormously; if you have a 5.1 set-up you will notice it from the opening of the first episode. Sagan's narration always remains clear. In addition, there is an isolated musical score & sound effects track, also in 5.1.It is truly amazing how relevant this series still is today. Sagan's message of cherishing life is truly universal, and his warnings about runaway greenhouse warming and nuclear war are just as pertinent today, perhaps even more so than in 1980. The episodes each provide a wealth of information and insight, but also pose some questions, which prompts you to think a little yourself on the topics. I simply can't recommend this release highly enough, as it is the most insightful and entertaining science series ever made, and a tribute to the man who dedicated his life to the ideal of understanding ourselves and the cosmos from which we spring.
I love the video. I only wish that the viewer would be given the option of different audio music from a menu. Classical, reggae, calypso, or light jazz would be a great option. I really get tired of the new age-like instrumental music after awhile. If you are viewing it at home turn down the audio and play your choice of music on your stereo. This is why I gave it 4 stars. The high definition quality is good. I am viewing it on a 1080p HDTV set using Toshiba's first HD DVD player.
Growing up in the late 1960s and early 1970s, I discovered the wonderful four-color world of comic books. I progressed quickly from Casper and Wendy through Archie and Jughead to the amazing adventures of Superman, Batman and their all-powerful peers. The great comics of this time period formed my definitive view of what the medium should look like: exciting, powerful, and daring.Like most kids, I didn't pay very much attention to who made these books. That appreciation came later. Names like Stan Lee, Carmine Infantino, Neal Adams, Jim Steranko, Will Eisner, Joe Kubert, and others came into my sphere of awareness. And, of course, Nick Cardy.Way back then, I didn't even notice how much of his stuff was on my favorites list: Aquaman, Teen Titans, and countless mystery stories from Ghosts, Unexpected, and House of Secrets. Not to mention some of the most memorable covers I'd ever seen (many of which are reprinted in this book, including some in full color).This book is a fantastic collection of Nick Cardy's work, presented as an overview of an amazing career. The material is presented mostly as a chronological survey, which actually makes it easy to follow Cardy's career. There are a few other chapters, including one on the differences between inking and penciling. The meat of the book - in fact, the bulk of its text - is an interview that author John Coates conducted with the formerly reclusive Cardy.To call the book "lavishly illustrated" is to make an understatement. There are so many illustrations and samples, including a four-page run of "Tarzan" daily strips, that you'll find yourself reading the book twice; once for the interview and once more to read all the great comics and strips peppered throughout the book.This is a VERY good book for fans of Nick Cardy, and for people interested in the early, wild-n-wooly days of the Golden Age of comics. There are plenty of anecdotes and stories about other comic creators, so this book has significant value to comic historians. It also provides a detailed index of his comics work. So, if you're a fan or historian, this book will not let you down... and you won't be able to put it down, either!
I am a big fan of Nicole Oring, which is why I bought this movie. I own many of these torchlight movies with her in it, but this one is by far, the best I've seen so far. This movie also stars porn regulars Joeleen and Cherokee (who for some reason is credited as "Cheyenne"). There are 2 boy/girl scenes, both with Oring. 2 girl/girl scenes, one with Oring and Joeleen and one with Joeleen and Cherokee and the Grand Finale is a girl/girl/girl scene with all 3 actresses mentioned.There is explicit nudity here, mostly on the part of Nicole Oring, (strange, since she is the only non-porn star in this film) especially in the final 3-way scene.The plot is very simplistic; Oring's character wakes up with the drummer of a particular band after a night of partying. Strange thing is, each time she wakes up after these nights of partying, she wakes up with a different person, sometimes guy, sometimes girl - each claiming to be the drummer of said band. Kinda weird and silly, but whatever - the sex scenes were all pretty hot!
I saw the movie and loved it. Then purchased "Master and Commander" and settled in for a nice read. I had heard of the "Sea of Words" book and seen it in the stores but was resistant to purchasing anything unecessary. In this case it was a mistake.After about 100 pages, I stopped reading the book until I actually had the Sea of Words in hand (Christmas). I realized that skipping over terms and phrases which I didn't completely understand was becoming too frustrating; one of the joys of reading the book is the 'forgotten' words and history.I think its safe to assume that anyone even considering the book will probably purchase it regardless of any review; my only recommendation is that if you have the money, just go ahead and get the "Sea of Words" book at the same time; that way its there for reference right from the start.
~Joanna Wayne begins a new miniseries called Hidden Passions in "Another Woman's Baby." Megan Lancaster returns to her hometown for Christmas nine months pregnant. A surrogate mother, Megan agreed to carry her best friend's baby before the parents were killed. Now Megan is struggling to decide what to do with the baby when Bart Cromwell arrives in her life. Bart is secretly trying to protect Megan from a danger she doesn't know she faces. Can he also help her make a family with her baby?"Another Woman's Baby" is a well-written story with an emphasis on the relationship between Bart and Megan. It is slowly paced with good development and scenes that help us to see how they fall in love. Though the book does take place within a few weeks, this is a nice change from most Intrigues, where the characters are on the run and fall in love in a few days. Because the characters are in one place, they have the opportunity to learn about one another. Bart is a protective and kind hero. Megan is strong and determined. Readers who enjoy the kind of love story where the characters spend a lot of time together and get to know each other will enjoy this one. Readers who enjoy strong suspense in their stories may be disappointed, because the romance is the strength of "Another Woman's Baby," not the suspense.I found the suspense portion of to be too obvious and boring. I suspect many mystery readers and diehard Intrigue readers will find the same. Within a few chapters, I immediately guessed everything that was ultimately revealed about Megan, the birth mother and why someone was after her. There's really only one solution to the mystery that will ensure not only a happy ending, but an ending that will wrap everything up so neatly and place a bright red bow on top. This makes it far too easy to guess the big surprises in the end and may leave some readers bored or frustrated waiting for the characters to come to conclusions they already have. If Wayne had made it seem like any other solution was possible it would have made the story more suspenseful. It also would have added to the emotional drama. Issues are tied up so neatly the characters don't have to make any tough choices. They're all made for them. Also, while the slower pace adds to the romance, it lessens the suspense. The villain's threats are spread out over so much time that I wondered why this person didn't seem in any hurry to get rid of Megan if that was really the goal. Though Wayne's setting and tone is atmospheric, the suspense plot was too obvious for me.Had the ending been more of a surprise, I would have enjoyed the story more. Instead, it became a too-predictable waiting game and I was bored. Romance readers should enjoy "Another Woman's Baby" more than mystery readers.
I remember sitting in front of the television at my babysitters house about twenty plus years ago watching this movie over and over again. It was, and still is a great movie. All actors were under the age of sixteen when filming this movie, and each one did a great job. So if you like gangster movies acted by children set in the ninteen twenties filmed in the seventies give this one a shot, it's well worth your time.
First saw this dude on Conan O'Brien a while back. Forgot his name, and stumbled back across him by accident. What a find. Super enjoyable, laid back, kinda acoustic, kinda electronic, all around awesome album. Hard to really describe cause each song is different from the last. Kinda sounds a little like Gomez or the Beta Band, throw in a bit of Beck and stir. "The Commuter" has been stuck in my head for a long time. The line "I smoke this cigarettes with the cancer guarantee"...awesome.
This woman has got it! James Brown put the hits in this. This music is not for the faint of heart. I just had my 27th heart attack listening to this record.
This was the first book I have ever read concerning the history of the Israelis and Palestinians and I was very impressed. The book outlines the problems throughout the recent history of the region in a concise and smooth manner. I especially liked the fact that the book was co-authored by an Israeli and a Palestinian, eliminating any intentional or unintentional bias. The BBC series is also very informative but not as much so as this book, which goes into more detail concerning the histories of the two groups of peoples.
After reading the prologue I was worried about this novel. I expected it to be no better (but certainly not worse) than the recent fare Lindsey has given us.Fortunately, the rest of the book was delightful. Sure, it has problems with anachronism (no, a lady wouldn't be allowed to galavant across Europe on her own) and plot (yes, they do fall into bed rather swiftly) but honestly, what romance doesn't?That's not to say that this is Lindsey's finest work, but it did instill a great deal of hope in this reader that she is getting back to form. Perhaps it's her move to Pocket from Avon - whatever the cause, I applaud her and encourage her to keep it up! She's getting closer to the former glory of her novels, where you fell in love with both the hero and heroine equally.Sebastian is an example of her classic dark, brooding hero with Margaret playing the spunky foil. They aren't drawn as well as some of her previous characters, but they are compelling and the reader comes to like them both.She seems to hit her stride with this novel roughly halfway through. The ending is a bit rushed, but nothing we haven't seen before. The plot is well developed and convuluted enough to keep you interested.Out of Lindsey's most recent works, this is the one I can best recommend. It gives me hope that her follow-up novel, a Mallory, will be even better and bring us back into the fold of that beloved family with the wit and style we know she's capable of.
HAving grown up wathching Kennedy and Johnson and McNamara on our black and white tv, it was hauting to listen to McNamara talk about it. He raises some issues that neither Republicans nor Democrats can answer...I do need to very a few statements from the movie. For example, is it really true thet McNamara got Ford to introduce seat belts and padded dashboards without governement legislation. If so, score one for capitalism!Also, I was taught that Kennedy was getting ready to send large numbers of troops into Viet Nam before he was assassinated. McNamara contradicted that.
***Update (11/25/12)***Bought my second wok since the first one (of almost four years) had endured the toughest conditions. The coating has started to peel and it is time to replace. Please keep in mind people, these non-stick coatings do NOT last forever and especially if you do a lot of cooking like me. This applies to ALL nonstick products no matter what the costs. If you want something where you wouldn't have to deal with the problem then maybe consider buying a pre-seasoned carbon wok, but then again they involved a different type of maintenance too like spreading oil to clean the wok after you cook instead of washing it. I like to wash my wok clean. This time, I will try to prolong it by using lower heat (instead of max) and go easy with the bamboo spatula.Still made in the U.S.A., only the stamping on the bottom is a bit different, and thank goodness for the Amazon promo credit which made the deal much sweeter!(original review)Before this, I was extensively comparing to two others: TheT fal Jumbo Wokalong with theCirculon Elite Hard-Anodized Aluminum 14-Inchand I finally nailed it down to the Nordic Ware. One of the main reasons were because I wanted to replace a $[...] wok by 'Invitations' that I purchased not too long ago from Bed Bath & Beyond - actually it was like $[...] after rebates and promotions, so no love lost here.The comparisons...T fal Jumbo Wok: I was ready to buy this wok from a major retailer. As I was going through the bunch, I could not find one that was like new, either there is a scuff here, a scratch there or a knick in between, and as I went through and finally came to one that was knick and scratch-free; the helper handle was deformed. So I said "screw it". Although this wok looked rather good, but it just didn't have the right feel to it, also, it was a bit on the light side and felt kind of flimsy - not worth the price.Circulon Elite: The same retailer did not carry the actual item but I was able to get an idea from one of their medium sized stir fry pans. The product feels heavy (which I like) but I wasn't too fond of the high-low food release design. I'm sure it was a feat of engineer but that didn't do it for me, non-stick is non-stick, it doesn't have to be any more complicated than it is. I'm more into the long-term and durability of its material that was put into it rather than the fancy grooves. I'm sure it works wonders, but for the addition to its marketing strategy; I wasn't sold.The conclusion: I wanted a wok which was not only identical to the one I replaced but can perform and handle my day to day tasks. I stir-fry, steam, braise, fry, saute - whatever, you name it! The Nordic Ware 14" wok has exceeded all the expectations, if not, more! It was tested in and by commercial kitchens and NSF certified so I can count on its rigorous strength. Upon the first day of using it (unlike the one I replaced and used with wooden utensils; the non stick coating stripped right off of its initial use), I stir-fried some vegetables with high heat from my electric counter top and was able to achieve some nice searings, food releases with a breeze and it has definitely passed the test of time! Before I toss the other wok out, I kept the removable handle and it fit my new wok like a glove. Now I know why the other cheap wok wanted to imitate the Nordic Ware 14" Asian Spun Wok, clearly, there is no comparison!Pros:*Great weight and balance*Premium non-stick coating*Perfect size and depth for tossing*NSF certified and very high quality*Made in USA*20 Year warranty!!!Cons:*Grip handle is a bit thin, but can get used to (I replaced it with the old wok's rubber grip which is more thicker and fits perfectly)*Removable rubber handle is some work when coincide with oven, the good thing is I don't really use it in the oven except for storing afterwards.
I have only had my Nano for a few days, but I LOVE it! My boyfriend got it for my for my b-day and loved it so much he got himself one!I was so amazed with the small size and how incredibly light weight it is. So far I have about 700 songs downloaded onto it. I recommend getting the car stereo adaptor which I have and it is amazing!Now, one reviewer said something about the Nano being flimsy and it will break if you drop it. Obviously you need to take care of this device and if you're clumsy and drop it then you deserve to have it break. As for the scratches on the screen, I have not removed the protective plastic that is on my Nano to protect it from well scratches. If you have removed that protective plastic, simply go to Radioshack or another electronics store and ask for PDA protectors. They come in sheets of 4 and you can cut them to if the Nano screen and vioila! Insta-scratch protector!Like I said, I have only had mine for 5 days but so far I am in love!
After reading Blood Of Heaven I was quite eager to read Threshold. Blood of Heaven was a book that I could not put down. I cared a great deal about the characters and the storyline was extremely captivating. I was so eager to find out what was going to happen next. I read the book in 3-4 days. Well with Threhold I was majorly disappointed. The storyline was interesting, however I really did not like where he took the premise. The story was not as focused as Blood of Heaven, Myers seemed unsure of what he really wanted to do with this book. Some of the characters were interesting, however many of them really did not interest me. Most of the secondary characters were not developed at all, they were just there. Thier backgrounds and motivations were really not developed. The main character of Brandon was somewhat interesting, however he seemed like a weak character to base a book around, Sarah was a far more interesting. My biggest problem with the book was trying to visualize many of Brandon's visions, they become more outlandish and outright silly as the book went on. Brandon's final confrontation at the end did absolutely nothing for me, I could not take it seriously at all. Years ago when I used to read Stephen King he was able to make just about anything believable, no matter how bizarre and out there it may have been. That most definately was not the case with Threshold. Overall I found parts of the book enjoyable. I did like the resolution and the development of Brandon's abilities. This book really did not grab me. I have just started Fire of Heaven, I do hope I am not disappointed with that one.
Like a previous reviewer, I have read this book and the opposing one, Caffeine Blues. Both offer a multitude of scientific studies to support their respective viewpoints. I plan to reread them soon, and do a more detailed comparison.Like another previous reviewer, I especially found the chapter on using caffeine to combat depression fascinating. It gave me the courage (or bravado?) to substitute a small daily dose of caffeine for my Paxil, with encouraging results so far (two months).It's hard to remain objective about something like caffeine, as is obvious from the tone of some of the other reviews. I remember a friend who I highly respected, once sneering that coffee lovers would explain away studies linking coffee and heart disease by objecting that it was the cream in the coffee rather than the coffee itself causing the problem. Since that was before we had been told about the danger of the transfats used to make those fake "creamers", those coffee apologists were probably right. Moreover, it came to light soon after his sneering remark that some of those early studies had failed to correct for the fact that a disproportionate number of heavy coffee drinkers were also smokers... thus giving an even more compelling reason for the innocence of the coffee.I admit that I'm hoping caffeine proves to be beneficial rather than harmful. But I plan to be as fair as I can be.Let me also point out that the caffeine pills recommended by the author are inexpensive and the formula is not susceptible to copyright. You can buy generic versions in any drugstore, or just drink coffee. There is not a whole lot of benefit to any particular pharmaceutical company, so I don't find the claim that he is writing this for his corporate masters very compelling. The author of Caffeine Blues touts a lot of products in his book as well, so the "follow the money" argument doesn't seem to tip the balance in favor of either position.
I have only read up to chapter 4. Making that point clear, the only thing I can say about this book is: How many computer books you can say you non-stop? This book is a page-turner!Extremely well written, very open-oriented and detailed. Full with advices all around.The only reason why I am writting this review before finishing it is because I got the Fourth Edition 2 weeks ago at a local bookstore... I don't know why this website still carries the older version.... So look for the new one! It is THE Win2k book to have in your library...
This is one of Frank Sinatra's better films, though it is about average plot wise for an outing like this. A PI single handedly breaks a case while smoking, drinking and making wise cracks. Frank himself is always a joy. However, what makes this a five star film is Deanna Lund. It was one of her biggest roles as a beautiful young starlet and was actually to be her last hurrah before returning to Florida as a businesswoman. However, Irwin Allen saw the rushes and knew that Deanna was the perfect Valerie for Land of the Giants and the rest is history. Her one scene steals the film and Frank was definitely impressed, but that's another story.
i've used hammer gel for many years, ever since i did an exhaustive reading of several cycling messageboards, adn found that hammer gel was just about the top rated gel amongs users. sometimes i've bought Gu gels becuase they do tend to be cheaper, esp. when you can find them on sale, and they suffice, but hammer gel seems to give me a little more energy, especially this espresso flavor with the caffeine load.I use either for inline speed skating races (always), and quite often during training for the same, or while doing running training, esp. when i feel i need a little get-up-and-go. The espresso works wonders in this regard. In fact, it works 'too good' and i have to watch that it doesn't become a mandatory part of every training workout.Though many suggest taking it with water, i haven't found it necessary, and i hate to carry water bottle, so i take it straight.Best to take a little a few minutes before starting and then once or twice during workout. For races, best to take as recommended, and they do suggest intervals on the instructions.The bottle does save a few bucks, but sacrifices convenience. Bottle allows for partial shots. on one order (rom REI), i found both bottles to require thinning with a little water since it was very thick- no problem to accomplish. Personally, i go with the bottles, and carry a few of the packets in my sports bag in case i ever forget the flask or just run out.I love this stuff, and it does give a kick to my workouts. It will also save your workout big time if you ever find yourself bonking. That's why i originally got it, but i use it more generally now.
I'll have to agree with the person that said, "I think she wrote this because she had to." This book was so very boring. Not to mention there are only two sex scenes throughout this entire long and drawn out story. The hero and heroine are forgettable characters. The heroine is quite unlikable. This plot is not so bad; it's just that this was not put together well at all. I was very disappointed. This book was extremely hard for me to read from beginning to end.
My lights did great for the first year, but the battery compartment corroded over the winter and they were useless after that. Not recommended unless you only need them for a year.
Plot Summary: Three shepherd boys on the verge of manhood will flee their sleepy village when the Dark One's forces attack. Helped by a Warder named Lan, and an Aes Sedai named Moiraine, Rand, Mat, and Perrin try to stay one step ahead of the unnatural enemies who stalk them. The friends don't know why they've been targeted, and Moiraine is determined to get them to Tar Valon, the stronghold of the ancient Aes Sedai. One of these three will become the key to the Dark One's return to power, and he's determined to have their obedience, or their lives.The easiest way to describe The Eye of the World is to compare it to J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings series (from this point on I'm going to resort to acronyms, and use WoT for Wheel of Time and LOTR for The Lord of the Rings). There are so many similarities between these epic fantasy creations that if they were relations, I'd say they were first cousins at the very least, or maybe even siblings. They definitely should not breed together, or they'd produce pop-eyed children. For readers hankering for a good, long, adventure that traverses thousands of miles, this 800-page brick will do the job admirably. I enjoyed myself from start to finish, and while this introduction book didn't tap my deeper emotions, I think that if I continue the series it just might.For all that I'm tempted to draw parallels between LOTR and WoT, there was one big difference that pleased me greatly. It's been many years since I read Tolkien's great work, but I do recall getting bogged down at times, bored by yet another elfin song, or some obscure piece of history that had me skimming paragraphs, if not whole pages. In my opinion, Tolkien was a little too wrapped up in his own little world at times, and he forgot about the reader. I think that Robert Jordan's style is much more accessible, and he kept everything moving at a brisk clip. Even when one of his characters settled down to tell a story, it never tested the limits of my concentration. Mr. Jordan's work is extremely similar to Tolkien's, but I found it more readable. Not once in 800-pages was I tempted to skip or skim, and that's saying something.One of the trickiest things about these epic stories is juggling the wide cast of characters. There are a lot of people running around, half of them with un-pronounceable names (too bad I didn't notice the glossary at the back until the very end), but I think Mr. Jordan did a decent job. I wish a bit more time was invested in Rand, the corner stone for the story, but with eleven more books to go, I'm confident that even the guys on the sidelines will be brought to life in exquisite detail.I'm reading through the WoT series as part of a monthly reading challenge, and I'm glad that we're tackling these one-a-month. While many readers probably read these back-to-back, I'll enjoy the break in between each installment. The Eye of the World was stuffed to the gills, and I want to have time to ponder it, and let my anticipation build for the second book, The Great Hunt.
A blind girl has an operation and can finally see the world....but her new found sight also shows her the dead.If you don't mind films with subtitles, this is a good pick. Great music for the film that really sets the mood. Very well done. More suspense or drama than horror.The best part about this movie is that it takes the audience through the various stages of her sight. At first, things are blurry and hazy, which makes it difficult to tell if she's seeing something real or other-worldly. Then slowly her vision improves and that's where the fun begins!
Fly Again is one of the best dance albums of 2004. I was blown away with tracks like - Living Out Loud. It started off with a piano intro and one minute into the track the dance beats started pounding. I wasn't expecting the bonus CD featuring Chris Cox with extended mixes of the Fly Again album. What a treat! This is equally IMPRESSIVE music and should be commended.
The storyline for this regency is a bit different in that she's a prostitute after falling for a man's advances. Her despoiller continues to use her like bait -- luring gentlemen for a night with the mysterious masked Miss M - whom he's trained between beatings.He never lets a man continue to visit 'Miss M" often enough to threaten his hold over her. Untill he loses badly in a card game to Lord Devlin. Sounds like it'd be good, huh?Devlin truly saves Miss M (Uhh, can we get a name please?). He's a soldier who's believably in love with her. sigh. The gentleman is willing to set mother and child up comfortably, and then never see her again, after the marriage (to someone else) he must make - as he feels responsible for Miss M.Sap. I recommend this book for Harlequin subscribers, but most may prefer a more interesting story (not just storyline). This doesn't have that level of stimulation throughout to be a good romance novel.
The included receiver has very limited range. If you already have another receiver (I did) you might be able to live with this set.There is no back lighting on the keys or mediapad LCD.The media pad is somewhat useful to use as remote control for iTunes and Windows Media Player. However the useless LCD can't navigate song titles, it simply displays the currently playing title. Would be great if you could scroll down a list of artist/tunes and tag for play.
After having both navigated the treacherous waters of Melville's book and signed on to John Huston's cinematic voyage, there is only one conclusion an old salt can come to - John Huston was a genius. The screenplay he created with Ray Bradbury stands as perhaps the greatest adaptation of a work I've read/seen. Not that it is completely faithful to the letter of the book, but more to the spirit. The book is immense, it meanders marvelously as the story of an obsessive Captain unfolds, as the history of whaling and the legends of whalers are told. It is a classic, there is no doubt, but its length, breadth, and depth are as immense as the leviathan itself. To make a movie of it would take strength, fortitude, courage, divine guidance, and perhaps a touch of black magic. The way Huston and Bradbury make memorable scenes from Melville's raw material is amazing - from the foreshadowing speech of a madman to the conquering of Saint Elmo's fire, to the circling birds at the end. Huston the writer and Huston the director have forged the weapons to smite the whale and give life to a time long past, in a movie the likes of which we may never see again. Others have tried this same task, and alas, are little remembered, while Huston's version, alone, survives.
this works well with our Acer, Windows Vista. IT comes with software, but you should have your own camcorder software for optimal results. We are using this to transfer video from our miniDV recorder and then editing the footage to put clips on YouTube. Works great for us! Great price too compared to others we looked at that did NOT include the cord w/ it. We liked that you get both with this.
I've used this floss for years, and suddenly Wal-Mart doesn't carry it anymore. I've been trying to substitute Glide floss, but it's so slippery I can't keep it wrapped around my fingers, it cuts into my skin, and it doesn't feel as if it removes anything from between my teeth, so here I am at Amazon.com, what would I do without you? Oral B Ultra Floss is easy to use, and I can feel it cleaning. Please don't stop making it!
I have not even installed this yet and I'm angry already. I've had good experiences with WD drives so I expect this one will be fine. What I'm NOT fine with is the fact that the retail package does NOT come with the cable and utility software. I could have bought the OEM version cheaper elsewhere.
I absolutely appreciate a cook book with simple, easy to use recipes. But this book is filled with almost laughable recipes that are almost too absurd to be true. Take the recipe for chopped parsley...Which is of course simply chop the parsley. Or carrot juice... which is take a few carrots and then juice them. At some point you have to ask: who in the world would buy a cook book that tells them how to make chopped parsley?! There are so many amazing raw food books out there, and this just isn't one of them.
Great quality! Most are one piece of rawhide. No shards. My dogs absolutely love them. I would definitely recommend them!
Karajan completely undermines what should have been the AIDA of a generation. What a waste of a magnificent cast and orchestra, not to mention one of the best recording jobs of its period.His tempo choices alone ruin the recording. Tebaldi is obviously at sea, and who could blame her? Everything is overextended and/or overemphasized. And for what reason, except to prove that he is the great Karajan and totally in charge?A great opportunity, completely missed.
I got this as a gift from a friend who knew I was an Ina fan. This set is basically a three-disc compilation of nine episodes of her Food Network show. They're from earlier in the show, so better than the more recent "Back to Basics" thing that she has been doing. There are a lot of recipes included, about 4-5 per episode so you're getting a good 40 or so recipes, all of which look delicious and are deceptively simple.Buy this if you don't have regular access to Food Network to watch reruns of Barefoot Contessa; otherwise, get a cookbook, which would be an easier reference than a DVD.
I am happy that I do not have to search high and low for a replacement charger. My dog often eats the cord on my chargers. This is the nintendo brand one which is nice. It is only good for the lite. That is kind of sad. At least though there is no pieces to loose. It folds up flat for easy storage. I never worry about the prongs getting damaged.
To preface - I read the last 4 Dresden books first - and the first Alera book and I found them all amazing, wonderful awesome books. I decided I should go back and read the Dresden files from the beginning since I like the characters.Then I read this book. In many ways I wasn't prepared for just how bad the writing was - the characters didn't have any development, in fact you could argue that the characters acted in ways that would only propel the plot forward - and nothing else. Murphy's actions didn't really make sense at all, the suddenly trusting new friends also didn't make a lot of sense. The attempts at plot layering felt forced and almost "cute". But the worst thing was the dialog was all rigid and stilted - cookie cutter if you will.The big problem here is that Dresden books work (to me) because of the character interactions not the plot - since all Dresden plots typically go like this:Short intro where Harry gets beat upHarry gets involved in something he doesn't want to be involved inHarry gets beat up. A lot.Harry's friends are in trouble. Some may get beat upHarry gets beat up more.Harry saves the day.So if the plot is cookie cutter and the dialog is cookie cutter - the book fails terribly.Now this basic plot structure does work in later books (white night, small favor) due to the wonderful rapport that Mr Butcher eventually starts creating, but this rapport does not exist in Fool Moon (or Grave Peril for that matter). This was a very disappointing read.
A superior being from outer space comes to earth, and of course we, instead of waiting to see what his intentions are, we shoot first, then we ask questions. Next we find a semi-friendly alien, with a message, "You are a violent people." A message we long to understand. Comply as peaceful people, or be destroyed.But we no like being told we must give up our violent ways. DUHH! A very good movie worth the price, if just for the fun of it.
This movie is a cute and sweet family movie. It helps grow kids imagination. We have even given each other names of the bears. Would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a good family movie night.
This game is better than resistance, uncharted, and the darkness. They are all great games,but this game is way better. You get to stop time,slow time and reverse time. And I only paid $37 tax included,but well worth the $49.99. Would have paid more if I had to. You should buy this game right now!!!!!!!!!!!!
I found this gate hard to set up - the instructions weren't as clear as I would have liked and did not mention to remove the vertical bars before trying to adjust sections. (I am a minor DIYer).It's great once it's in place, though! It is very sturdy and the gate is easy to open if you have a free hand.
There's bad, and then there's so bad that all I want to mention is that someone has a huge collection of Fangoria at home and used every one of the cheap makeup ideas in this one, including the one about filling a balloon with grape jelly, putting a mask on it, and bashing it with a 2x4 to make it look like a zombie head explosion. Not even fun, just badly done.I had more fun making Tazmanian Cheese Devils. Take a hot dog, put it in your mouth, chew it up. Now spray ketchup all over your face. Now spit it out, screaming "Ma dhug, ma dhug!"
I have ordered several bread machine cookbooks on Amazon and I have found wonderful loaves come out of my bread machine with this one...in fact the Jalapeno cheddar is one of our favorites (but we alter the recipe a bit for special diets--great thing about bread makers...you can!). That one is wonderful for sandwiches and a good side for a Southwestern meal.We have a 2 pound bread maker and I was pleased that this included recipes for the larger loaf machines, as well as the medium, and small loaves...every recipe lists measurements for a small, medium, and large loaf.There is a VERY wide variety of breads and it also includes easy doughs to finish into rolls, etc. The book has 138 recipes total. It even has a great recipe for soft pretzels! So you are sure to expand your thinking in terms of what you can do with your bread maker.Here are some other examples:Multigrain buttermilk breadHoney Whole Wheat BreadWhole Wheat Pita BreadAuthentic French BreadDill BreadButtermilk Cheese BreadRussian Black BreadOrange Coconut Sweet RollsTomato BreadBeer Bread......and lots more in between!That said, I am an "extreme" cookbook collector but this was the first cookbook I had ever seen that, on some recipes, didn't give you an exact measurement. Any baker knows that you have to be pretty precise on baking ingredients...so much so that commercial bakers use weights just to be exact. Now, I wouldn't want weights in my cookbook, but this book will say things like "1/8 to 1/4 c milk" on a recipe for a medium loaf. That's a pretty big difference. Or odd measurements like "7/8 to 1 cup buttermilk" 7/8? What cookbook gives you things like that? Another is "1 1/4 to 1 3/8 c water". And how do you decide which way you should go since you aren't making the recipe up on your own...you are using a cookbook to get it exactly precise?Because of that, I wondered if these weren't exactly "tried out" prior to printing, but perhaps came from variations of other recipes?It does say you need to watch your bread if it kneads and if it appears dry to add the extra liquid...but lets, face it, we buy the bread machine to dump in the ingredients and let it do all the work while we do something else and we know it can do this easily and well.Still, the recipes are great. I use whatever ingredient measurement sounds most "normal"...if it says 7/8 to 1 cup I add a cup. And I should note this isn't on every recipe that the author does this...also, it's usually only one ingredient on any given recipe, not all ingredients. Typically she'll have the variation in measurements on the liquid. Apparently, my way of figuring out the measurement works (the one that sounds most normal(!))...we haven't had a bad loaf yet. They've all been great. So perhaps I've been lucky or that variation doesn't make so big of a difference after all? I don't stand and watch my bread maker knead in order to work out the proper amount. That defeats the purpose somewhat in my opinion.If you aren't a fan of the cookbooks that ask you to add in wheat gluten, you won't need to here. Of course you can always add in anyway but some cookbooks call for it and it's not always easy to find.Know going in: If you like photos, there are none here. I'm okay with that...most loaves look fairly similar but if you need the visual, this may not be the book for you. Also, it's printed on regular paper like a novel would be written on...not slick or easy to wipe. I LOVE LOVE the fact that the author listed the nutritionals for each loaf. I can NEVER find that in bread cookbooks and they can vary quite a bit so if you are someone who watches your intake, it does help and that's a huge bonus in my book.Conclusion: Though I wished further testing would have been done to work out the science behind the perfect loaf with precise measurements and I would have preferred some slick pages, I still love this book because it has some great flavors and it has the calorie, fat, etc content too.
If you have large hairy hands that drag on the ground and you watch a lot of football then this is probably for you. Otherwise it's just too damned large and heavy for practical use.
Of all the books dealing with the subject of local TV, FROM SOUPY TO NUTS!: A HISTORY OF DETROIT TELEVISION is my favorite. Naturally, the fact that I grew up in Detroit makes me the perfect audience for this volume.This book brought back a flood of wonderful memories. So many names, so many programs. Kid-show hosts (Soupy Sales, Johnny Ginger, Jerry Booth, etc.), horror-movie hosts (Sir Graves Ghastly, The Ghoul, Morgus the Magnificent, Count Scary), newscasters and reporters, sportscasters, weathercasters, etc. -- they're all here, and plenty of others, including some unsung behind-the-scenes personnel.I had tears in my eyes reading the chapter devoted to the pro wrestlers who were my childhood heroes: Dick the Bruiser, The Sheik, Fritz Von Erich, Johnny Valentine, Bobo Brazil, and others. In later years, I got to know some of these guys, and they were friendly and cordial -- not at all like their violent, rough-and-tumble public images.I give this book my highest recommendation.
I had no issue with sticking - they peeled away perfectly, and love that they are unbleached so worry about any chemical leaching. only wish the package contained more!
I purchased Athena Technologies subwoofer from a e-retailer, and Athena Technologies customer service refused to service the defective subwoofer. I am stuck with a $250 dollar subwoofer that doesn't even power up.
I recently purchased both Hoopnotica Beginner Levels 1 and 2. I am new to hoop dancing and I watched both of these DVDs from beginning to end without hooping just to concentrate on the instructions. I think they are both excellent DVDs as they are very clear, organized and concise. If you are trying to decide on which one to get, I recommend that you start with the Level 1, but really you should get both. I plan to collect these as they come out, they are really that good. (Note that these aren't exercise routine DVDs - they are for learning the techniques of hoop dancing.)
I have read well over a thousand spiritual texts over the past forty years, and one of the first ones I read was Autobiography of a Yogi. And I not only read the book, I signed up for meditation lessons from the Self-Realization Fellowship. I religiously practiced the SRF lessons for a number of months, but as I devoured other spiritual literature and experimented with other meditation techniques, it became apparent to me that SRF was a limited spiritual vehicle and that Paramahansa Yogananda was a vastly overrated, not fully enlightened, guru. In the monumental spiritual text "Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi" (which is a quantum leap better than Autobiography of a Yogi), Yogananda visits Maharshi, the foremost twentieth-century Indian guru, and ask him questions that a fully enlightened guru would not ask another one. For example, he asks "Why is there suffering?" and "What can be done to get rid of it? As the exchange makes clear, Yogananda was a yogi-seeker, not a Self-realized sage like Maharshi.In the forty years since I jettisoned the SRF lessons, I have become an ultra-advanced spiritual practitioner and an unsurpassed expert on yoga and mysticism (and I welcome challenges to my expertise). My viewpoint on Autobiography of a Yogi is this: It's a moving (though partly fictional) read for the spiritually unsophisticated, but for those into the foremost traditions--Advaita Vedanta, Kashmir Shaivism, Zen, Mahamudra, Dzogchen, Daism, et al.--which surpass SRF's Kriya Yoga, it is a worthless one--unless you actually believe that an ageless Mahavatar--Babaji--is forever bopping around in the Himalayas.Here's my favorite Yogananda quote:"The average man cannot think clearly... He needs the master mind of a Dictator in order to think right and do right." - Yogananda. "Interview". East-West, Vol. 6.For more on Yogananda that will shock you, go to: [...]If you want to read the best spiritual autobiography ever written, get a copy of "The Knee of Listening," by Adi Da Samraj. This book, along with "Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi," served to enlighten me more than any other spiritual literature.
Logitech is generally a good brand and most of their mice have proven sturdy and long-lasting. This seems a bit flimsier than the old Marble Mouse I am used to, but time will tell. I found in the past that Logitech drivers and software were bloated and filled your computer with nuisance pop-ups and bogged down the system with background tasks that are difficult to get rid of and/or impossible to prevent. So far this mouse does not appear to have that problem. It added only 2 running processes in Task Manager after installation and they are necessary.I have to use an ergonomic mouse due to RSI. There are worse ones than this one (Logitech M570 for instance which has a difficult to use and learn trackball under your thumb) but the Trackball on this is about the only useful feature and the placement of that takes some getting used to.Starting with the Pluses, the trackball is smooth, and despite other reviewers' complaints, I don't find the left-click button that inconvenient. In fact, it is the ONLY button that seems to be reasonably well located. Like all mice of similar ilk, you don't move the mouse; it stays in place. This is useful on a bed or car seat for instance with the mouse just under your hand next to your leg.The only other good feature is the program-ability of most of the buttons.Moving on to the Minuses which are numerous, and why I only give this model 2 stars.First, it is a wireless mouse, yet it has a cumbersome USB antenna almost the size of a deck of cards dangling off the side of the laptop. You may as well use a corded mouse. Wireless aspect is defeated by having a huge wired antenna to carry around and keep track of to say nothing of how much space it takes up in your way. That alone would be enough to drop it to 2 stars in my opinion but that is a minor annoyance compared with other negatives.It is extremely sensitive to using batteries that are not the same strength and won't even install if one is on the low end of "good." Overall the driver installation is among the most difficult I have encountered for a mouse in years.In Windows 7, the antenna is recognized immediately but the mouse won't connect, even after you push the two inconvenient connect buttons, one underneath the mouse that needs to be pushed with a penpoint. Get into the 21st Century Logitech!!! Generic wireless mice costing $6 from Hong Kong connect automatically as soon as you plug in the tiny USB adapter. Back to the real point. You have to go to the Logitech website, where there is no manual and no documentation of any use at all for this mouse and download the drivers and software, which automatically installs but the mouse still won't connect until after you reboot the computer. Nowhere does it say this in the near useless quick start sheet left on the website and packed with the mouse (sometimes maybe). This is the only piece of hardware I have installed in Windows 7 that does not automatically install itself, and the only one that requires a restart before it works. Again, this is the 21st Century. What is wrong with Logitech that they can't accomplish what every other mouse, keyboard, external drive etc has managed to do so easily? It costs more to get less. This is an expensive mouse and for little apparent reason.Now to the buttons, another feature that alone would drop this to 2 stars. There are 8 buttons, most programmable. To use all the buttons without repositioning your fingers constantly requires you to use your middle finger on the trackball so the first finger is free to find the 4 tiny programmable buttons located on the top of the mouse, which I find annoying. I am used to the Logitech Marble Mouse. On that you can choose to use either your first finger or your middle finger for the ball. Like this mouse though, if you use your middle finger, then the right-click is the third finger which is not easy to learn. Of course you can lift your desired finger off the ball with either mouse and then use it to also click the buttons left or right of the ball. Sort of defeats most of the purpose of using a ball I think.The buttons are counter-intuitive, too tiny in most cases, very inconveniently placed and difficult to discern their functions from either appearance or location. Overall the mouse is designed very poorly and would only be relatively easy to learn and use if you had no prior experience with other ergonomic mice including those from Logitech (with the exception of the even worse aforementioned M570 which I can't tolerate long enough to review it).The scroll wheel is about the only button easy to tell what it is by its appearance, but since it is tiny and the same color as the body of the mouse, it is practically invisible along with the 2 buttons on each end of it. Then there is another button below that set of 3 which is programmable but there is no practical way to remember what you have programmed any of these buttons to do. And they are difficult to find and tell from each other without looking at the mouse. Who needs to look at a mouse to use it???Despite how handy the 8 buttons could be once you get used to it, there are tons of ergonomic mice and tons of trackballs that are better designed ergonomically and more user friendly. This is a very annoying mouse. I rarely give any well-built product 2 stars, but this mouse fails.
This is an update of my previous review. I want to upgrade my rating to five stars since I've washed and used these sheets several times now. They are so soft and cozy that I've pretty much kept them on the bed all winter, just wash, dry and put back on. That's unusual for me because I like to have something different on the bed each time. I don't understand the review about them falling apart because these are very high quality. Some flannel after a few washings will get kind of rough and pilly, but these remain soft. I bought the Confetti print; maybe it makes a difference which style you get. The only criticism I could come up with is that the fitted sheet is too small for my Queen mattress which is 15" thick, smaller than some mattresses which can go up to 18". But it ended up okay because the sheets do stay on, probably because they are flannel; they stick to my mattress cover which is also a knit material. I wish Amazon would offer these in King size; I'd buy two sets!__________________________________________(Original review) I love these Melrose Home Confetti flannel sheets! I was a little hesitant to order these because it states "Heavy Cotton Flannel" which I already have and don't like, and also because of poor reviews on the other (Pike) flannel sheet sets which were around the same price...BUT I am more than pleased with them. After the first wash they came out light and fluffy and SO soft...no pilling whatsoever and hardly any lint build-up in the dryer lint trap, no more than my regular cotton sateen sheets produce. The last two sets of flannel sheets I bought are so heavy, bulky and somewhat stiff, and these are just what I was hoping for, very lightweight, flexible and soft. They are made in Spain which is also a plus. If you like the heavy, stiffer kind then these are not for you. The only negative for me is that in the description it says they are oversized to allow for shrinkage, leading one to believe they would fit today's thicker mattresses, but these are definitely not for the thicker mattresses. I would order a King for a Queen bed (and just tuck in the overage on the one side of the fitted sheet) but unfortunately they are not available. Now these are 8.99...I paid 14.99, still a great deal.
This book read like a script for a movie. It consists to a large extent of dialogue interspersed with description such as 'they got out on the xth floor'. It's hard not to get the impression that the script was rejected but somehow managed to find itself a publisher. The author seems to have done little more than string together masses of tape and court proceedings with basic vocabulary. It reads like a newspaper article that has radioactively morphed into more-than-book length. I was frustrated that the story did not stay with the perspective of one person and their understanding of the situation but jumped all over the place. This may work well in a movie where you have visual representations of the different characters, but in book form it created a very superficial story. Also, the relationship between M. Whitacre and his wife, as narrated, seems highly implausible. It would be interesting to read a book written by the wife. Some professional newspaper writers successfully morph into brilliant book writers. Eichenwald is not one of them.
DO you really think that this stuff is going to work? especially the trapping? so many people love trapping but when then try it in sparring it doesnt work.the lin lop sau,the bong lop sau,the same hand tan to lop sau-cmon now none of that works against anyone who doesnt leave their hand out there after they throw a punch! this may have been how people fought hundreds if not a thousand years ago but it certainly isnt practical now! if you want to spend lots of your precious time learning an art that most of it you cant use in sparring or in the street then so be it.but like bruce said "man {or for that matter any person man or woman} is MORE IMPORTANT than any art or system" even applies to jkd and wing chun-not the other way around!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I am not ashamed to say I was- and still am- a huge Donna Summer fan in the '70's. Her music was all about relaxing, having fun, and appreciating your friends and times around you, and getting away from everyday life stresses. However, I have always thought her critics never really stood back to give this wonderful talent the true recognition she deserves. Donna Summer remains a popular talent because she has an incredible voice, which I always expouse to people that try to belittle her.Of course, I bought this Christmas CD because it was Donna Summer, but even she blew me away and humbled me with this collection of Christmas songs. This is a first rate, blue ribbon production! The orchestrations are rich and full, a complement to her incredible voice, and what you would expect to hear in Christmas music to put you in a "Christmas mood." The album has a nice mixture of classic and religious Christmas songs. My favorite tune on the CD is the title track, "Christmas Spirit." The song will bring shivers to the spine of anyone who is a true Christmas believer. The Christmas medley is good too! (Thank you, Donna, for including my favorite Christmas song, "Joy To The World.")There are a lot of favorite pop/rock/country artists who have released Christmas albums. Most of the albums have turned out to be very disappointing productions to me and receive little to no playtime with me during the holiday. That is not true with this collection of songs. This is the one Christmas CD I have that I listen to during other times of the year too. It really is that good. I have played this CD during my holiday entertaining and it has received many compliments and queries as to its quality and who the artist was (those unfortunates who have been unfamiliar with her voice.) There are those rare singers, like Karen Carpenter and Ella Fitzgerald, who's voices are instantly recognized and appreciated for the "one-of-a-kind" that they are. Donna Summer has always had one of those voices to me. I guarantee this will turn into one Christmas CD that you will play over all others in your Christmas collection.
This is classic and can be listened to for background or to rock. What a soulful artist. These two CD's are what you would consider a best of because all his music is a best of. The musicians on these cd's are first class and two icon producers in Wexler and Dowd!
I've had other root feeders and they simply didn't hold up. For those and the Yard Butler, I've first hammered a section of rebar into the ground to make a hole. This seems to extend the life of the feeder quite a bit. My Yard Butler was "plugged up" when it arrived but I used a nail to push the blockage back into the tube and then used water to reverse flush it out. Worked fine after that. The big drawback to this feeder is the fact it doesn't have a built-in fertilizer system. I ended up buying a Hozon Brass Siphon Mixer (which is listed here on Amazon) and I liked the way it worked. You mix a big bucket of whatever you are going to use and then put the siphon in the bucket, turn on the water and come back later. My other feeders would run 5 or 10 minutes before needing to be reloaded with pellets. I left the Hozon/Yard Butler running for an hour.Hint: If you turn the water on before putting the Yard Butler into the ground it will help keep it from clogging.I would buy the Yard Butler again.See my review on the Hozon Brass Siphon Mixer for the negatives on that unit.
This film is pure delight. From the beautiful rolling scenery of Scotland to the haunting soundtrack by Mark Knopfler - this film has it all. Very few films achieve the quaintness and subtle delight that this film presents. My only disappointment is with the DVD - it only comes with a mono soundtrack. A minor quibble really when one considers how good the music is and the emotions of escapism that it produces. Timeless.
I finished this two weeks ago, and I'm still bummed it's over. I was hooked. It took me a good 30 hours of play time which was fun the entire trip. Scary, gory, challenging, and fun. So worth it. The Wii controls are amazing. Number 5 can't come out soon enough.
The original Matrix movie was fantastic! The second and third movies were an embrassing waste of time, effort and money.The second and third sequels were so bad, they make "Howard the Duck" look like an Oscar winner.It's a shame a person has to buy this "Ultimate Matrix" Garbage Collection just to get the first good Matrix movie. The original Matrix movie should be released by itself on Blu-ray. If Warner Brothers decides to demonstate wisdom by releasing the original movie on Blu-ray, I will retract this gleefully negative review.I went to see "Matrix II" in a movie theater in Miami at an 8 PM Saturday showing one week after the movie opened. The theater was EMPTY. I honestly thought there was a bomb scare I was unaware of. At the time, I did not realize the bomb was the movie. I laughed through most of the movie. Not the good kind of laughter, but laughter due to how bad the movie was, the cake scene and Neo's stupidity.Long story short, do yourself a favor and wait for the original Matrix to be released by itself on Blu-ray. There is no excuse to throw money away by buying this collection.
THERE IS NO OTHER WORD TO DESCRIBE THIS ... THING (and that's) HORRIBLE : THERE IS NO SONG WORTHY OF REPEATING ! DON'T SAY GOODBYE IS EVEN WORSE LONGER, AND ALL HER OLD SPANISH SONGS SHOULD HAVE STAYED IN SPANISH ! SEXUAL LOVER S HORRIBLE ! WITH ITS HORRIBLE VOCALS AND BAD BAD TRANSLATION ITS NOT EVEN WORTH HEARING ! CASANOVA IS LIKE THE ONLY GOOD SONG ! THE ONLY REASON I LIKE IT IS FOR ITS CHORUS ! ...
Update: So far I have tried 3 different versions on the Kindle. They ALL appear to have been edited by a first grader, including the one E Williams is pushing. Is there a GOOD copy for the Kindle? [...]! The original material is great, good stuff everyone should know. If only the publishers would read it!One problem with Kindle and ebooks is that so many unqualified people can create them. This Kindle edition is full of typos. This book is in the public domain so it has been worked over many times. We need to know the source that was used to copy the work. It is obviously different from other versions. Is this a copy of the original? Or updated version? And how much was added or changed by the copier?It's like trying to follow a map that someone has edited.
When I bought this product, or at least the one I got in the store, it was pretty much made for those who wanted to record guitars(though I bought it to record on the keyboard but that's besides the point).Well what would you know, 1st the CD itself gave my drive a hard time. At times I felt like my CD drive on my computer would stop working altogether(The 2nd time I installed it I made a cd image and then installed it using a virtual drive to easy up on the cd drive). Then in installing it apparently some driver couldn't install. After installing and uninstalling I still never got it to install.Then when I did try to record my guitar, I could barely hear the signal. It's ridiculous how there are different effects for the guitar but yet you can't hear jack isht. Keep in mind the volume on my computer was all the way up and so were the speakers that i had connected to it. The main thing it was for, for recording the guitar and this isht wasn't even good for that. At most it at least gets rid of static so if you want to record a guitar or your voice, you're on your own. If you are like me and want to record yourself on the keyboard, get a piano/keyboard vst plugin and you'll be better off.The hardware itself wasn't great, the software itself isn't either and even the process of installing it is a pain(yes even physically to your cd drive, seems like it's about to break something off any time soon).
I read this because it was recommended to me. I'm in a relationship that is on the verge of ending. I was hoping for something to help me fix it or at least give me a way to cope. This book was astounding. I intend to try speaking my spouses love language, if I can change our relationship it might save us from losing a 6 yr relationship. I intend to recommend this to all of my friends. You never know who it might help. Fantastic book and highly recommend for everyone. Enjoy.
I really enjoyed this book. There are a couple of chapters in the middle that talk about the prostitution industry which got a little more graphic than I thought was necessary for a midwife's memoir, and if I were the editor I would have cut that portion back; but honestly, other than that, I really enjoyed reading this. I learned about it from watching the PBS series, which I also like. A great deal of artistic license is made in adapting this to a TV series, so I didn't feel watching the program and reading the book were redundant at all. A lot is changed and abbreviated in the TV version, and some things are completely added which aren't in this book at all.Overall, I would recommend this. It's a fascinating book to read and I learned a lot about the beginnings of England's national health care system and the bumps along the way. This is not just for midwives or people who are interested in childbirth at all. This is a great book for anybody interested in 20th Century British history (give or take a couple of decades), since it touches on subjects well beyond the early 1950's where it is mostly set.

I own nearly every one of John MacArthur's books and hold great respect for the man for all his biblically accurate teachings. He has done much for Christianity and the Reformed tradition of theology. However, I must warn other believers that this book is a complete failure and in opposition to MacArthur's life long legacy of teaching the true gospel of salvation by accepting and believing in Jesus Christ as both LORD and Savior. This is not the book for your children.Reformed Teacher/Author/Theologian John MacArthur is famous for teaching the true gospel to adults: We are sinners who deserve eternal punishment because we have broken the law of a holy perfect God. Thankfully, God came to earth as Jesus Christ and paid the price for the sins of those who would recognize their complete dependance upon Christ to save them, believe in Him and repent and turn from their sins in obedience. The obedience prooves that they REALLY believe in Christ. If they don't turn from their sins in obedience, this proves they don't really believe Christ or want him to be their Lord and Savior. This message is what I was looking for in a children's book. Since MacArthur has such a strong grasp on this true gospel message, I was sure a children's book would include this message.However, I feel like the other reviewer who gave a 2 star review, MacArthur failed to include a clear teaching of the gospel to children and I feel like his message skirts weakly around the sinfulness of children. This book has so many humanistic feel-good concepts, I am shocked that it was written by MacArthur. I feel like this book teaches an easy-believism "I make a mental declaration of belief" but no actual deep solid belief is required by this book's version of the gospel. I worry this book will give Christian children a false sense of security. Could this book's teaching have something to do with the fact that MacArthur (against the traditional beliefs of most Reformed brothers) believes that all babies/children/mentally handicapped all go to heaven? Sadly this book lacks the main recognition of our sinner nature and need for Christ that a reformed believer wants in the gospel for their children. I feel sad that John would water down the gospel for children, yet teach the full true gospel to adults.You decide for yourself: "Adam and Eve disobeyed God. They let Satan, one of the bad angels, talk them into doing something God had told them not to do. God punished them by making them leave the garden. Their sins - all the bad things they did - had separated them from God. Every person born since Adam and Eve disobeys God, too. That is why all people die and should go to a place of punishment forever. Have you ever noticed how hard it is to always be good, kind, loving and unselfish? How hard it is to obey? How hard it is to always love God with all your heart? Well, like other people, sometimes you do bad things, too. God could leave you like that and punish you just as He did Adam and Eve and the bad angels. But because God loves people so much, He wants to fill His beautiful heaven with people who will live with Him forever. Our sin should keep us out of heaven, but instead, God invites everyone - you too! - to come to Him and ask for forgiveness for our sins. And He PROMISES forgiveness to each one who asks. Can God just forgive us? Shouldn't He punish us? If God forgives us, does that mean that the bad things we do are not REALLY that bad? No, they are bad! In fact, they are so bad that even though God forgives us and doesn't punish us, He still punishes every one of our sins. How can God punish sins and not punish us? God always knows exactly what to do. He has a plan. God's Son, Jesus, came to Earth to take the punishment for us."- "Let Satan talk them into" seems to take away man's responsibility. It's like saying "The devil made me do it!"- Some readers might also feel uncomfortable with the "God punishes them by making them leave the garden". Is there a better way of looking at this than punishment?- "How hard it is to be good" doesn't give the child a sense of his own corruption and sinfulness. I would have worded it more like "Do you see how much you enjoy having your way? Do you see your own selfishness? Greed? Jealousy."- "Like other people, you do bad things too" sounds completely like an excuse! "Well, I do bad things, but you know what, so do other people! I'm no worse than them!"- "God could leave you... and punish you..." This should be "God SHOULD punish you..." MacArthur fails to show that we deserve the punishment. God is not the big meany. Humans deserve eternal punishment.- "But because God loves people so much..." Really? In the Reformed tradition, I thought it was "God loves God so much and seeks God's own glory"... so he chose to save the elect. Humans are not valuable or worth saving, as this sentence implies.- "AND God wants to fill heaven with people" Huh? When did the Bible ever state that? God doesn't need people in heaven. This isn't a REASON I'm familiar with in the Bible. The Bible doesn't give "God wanted to fill heaven with people, so he saved some" as a reason for Christ dying on the cross.- "God invites everyone - you too - to ask for forgiveness and He PROMISES forgiveness" This is easy believism. There is no recognition of sin or undeservedness. There is no mention of repentance!!! And guess what? If you "ask", then God MUST give you heaven because "God PROMISED". This is the false man-centered gospel! No, God does not have to save everyone and God does NOT save everyone who asks. Those who ask but disobey are not saved. Read the story of the rich young ruler. All those who disobey, prove they never were saved. These are the ones Jesus says "Depart, I never knew you."- "God knows what to do. He has a plan." This is as if God just comes up with plans as time passes. Ooops, Adam and Eve disobeyed, so God had to come up with Plan B. No, this destroys God's sovereignty and God's eternal plan. BEFORE the world was created, God and Christ and the Holy Spirit (God in 3 persons) planned the entire redeption story from start to finish, including even the smallest details. God never has to come up with a Plan B. Satan never can defeat God or trick God or outsmart God and neither can humans.I am so completely disappointed with this book by John MacArthur. It is against everything MacArthur stands for. It teaches children the false gospel that MacArthur has spent his lifetime teaching adults is false and won't get you to heaven.Not to be overly critican, but I believe most readers will be very disappointed with the pictures and find them too dull and boring. The artwork are pencil sketches that are watercolored in. You still see the pencil outlines. The pictures include dull brown colors of ground, trees, mountains, moon, and odd-looking open-mouthed people. I thought for sure a kid drew them, but found out John's adult daughter drew them.
I'll admit I had many doubts at first when I went to buy this game, but I had heard some good things about it so I decided I would give it a try. Well, my doubts went out the window after just an hour with this masterpiece of a game by Activision. Sky Odyssey is a flight simulation game just like Pilotwings 64 but done much better. It gives you many modes of play at first, such as target practice and landing pads. But the true fun and challenge is in the adventure mode. You are taken to a series of islands and told to complete certain missions like refuel your plane in midair or fly quickly through a small cave while avoiding falling rocks and wavy waters. Before each mission you are given a specific tutorial so you know exactly what to do and how to do it. But believe me, even with the tutorials these missions are very challenging and quite hard to complete under your given time limit. If you should finish your mission, you are then given a grade and depending what grade you get, you then get to choose one of many upgrades for your plane which will help you later on. It is really quite a innovative and cool system. And dont worry about replay value because there are plenty of missions the game has to offer.The different planes in this game are each very unique and neatly designed. As mentioned before they are all upgradable in areas such as their wing, engine, propeller, landing gear and more. And for you aspiring artists out there, the game even has a drawing program where you can draw your own symbol on the back of your plane!!The target practice and landing pad parts of the game should be used by beginners as they are good places to practice all of the flying skills with all of the planes. The control of these planes takes some getting used to and is best when you have an analog playstation controller. Once mastered, you wont be able to wait for your next chance to become a virtual pilot.My only problem with this game is the graphics. The weather effects are excellent and utilize the PS2's power very well, but on the training lessons and some parts of the main gameplay the graphics can get pretty bland and boring. A touch could've been made here and there to better enhance the whole flying experience. This is the only reason I didn't give the game a perfect score. But as long as a game has solid gameplay it usually hardly detracts from the whole experience.All in all I'd have to say this is one of the most original, challenging, and fun games I've played in a long time. If you have some extra cash and are lucky enough to own a Playstation 2, I would highly recommend this game. Unless you really don't like flight simulators, there is something in here for everyone. Definately one of the top games for PS2 this year.
I ordered this for my 5-year-old daughter and she just loved it. The movie is very tame...perfect for her age group.
I adore this little camera. It has very high resolution (great for large prints, I get sharp A3 prints out of it), very realistic colors (if you want very saturated colors look elsewhere) and low noise (A4 prints at ISO800 look just great). Its wide lens (32mm) and raw format are also nice to have. Highly recommended!
I'm sorry to write this review. I have enjoyed much of Linda Howard's writing but I just found this book too predictable and quite frankly boring. Daisy's persona just bothered me to no end. She was just too naive for me. There was no thrill of the chase with her and Jack. The romance just happened and she just happened to be the eyewitness of a crime and low and behold, her new lover is the Chief of Police coming to save the day. It just lacked substance. It was almost as if Linda Howard didn't have any idea for a story and just deceided that this one would have to do. Too predictable and lacking any luster!I'm really bummed out that I wasted my time on this one and I don't write this lightly.
When I read this book, I was in third grade. Even if I was a senior in college it would have had the same effect on me. This is my all time most favorite book. I loved the character and I longed to be just like her. I know that sounds pathetic, but its unimaginable how this book can make you feel! WOW! You laugh along with Matilda and learn with her too. This book should be read by everyone! Not just third graders. I LOVED IT AND THATS ALL I CAN SAY.
As I said above, I liked the first book better but the characters became even more human in this second installment! We get to see Carmen have yet another parental crisis, Lena lighten up while dealing with her first real love, Bridget finally come to terms with her past and Tibby finally creates a movie she is proud of. Mothers and daughters really play a huge roll in this book.Once again this author is not afraid to address real teen issues. Worth a read!
I moved into an efficiency apartment about 1.5 years ago. A major down flaw of the place is the fact that it does not have a full kitchen! WHAAAAAAAT? A person that loves to cook without a way to cook? All I had was a hot plate?BLASPHEMY!I needed a way to actually cook. "Is there a such thing as an oven that does not take up the room as a regular oven?"Enter this oven.The little kitchenette is small on top of not having an oven or stove. I looked at the Cuisinart version of the countertop oven but it was more expensive and it did not have the convection feature. I rolled the dice and went with the lesser name.I usually wait a while before I make my opinion hence 1.5 years later. This oven has saved me from going crazy and choking people because I could not cook. The convection feature is great! A few times the fan did get a little noisey but a simple cleaning fixed that right up. I have used the rotisserie many times. I will advise you that if you are making a full sized chicken you use some twine to tie up the legs and wings. If you do not do this they will (and if the bird is large enough) drag the pan and sometimes stop the motor from turning the bird. When making roasts be sure to try to get the "spit" as centered as possible. Some of the best roasts I ever made were in this oven using the rotisserie feature. I do wish it came with a way to make Kebabs or possibly a basket as the Ronco rotisserie oven.The Drawbacks?:Baking:I like to bake as well as cook meals. If you are baking anything of any importance be ready to loose a shelf! I will tell you why. Since this oven is basically a large toaster oven it has the same heating elements that a smaller toaster oven has and works the same way. The door does not seal too well so a lot of the heat is lost. This makes the elements almost in constant "ON" mode when you are using the oven. The elements are just to rods on the top and bottom of the oven. If you try to make a cake, or pie, or an item that requires an indirect heat in order for it to turn out right. I am not saying you can not bake in this oven! My solution was to use the included baking pan or one of the pizza trays on the top shelf. Yeah yeah this only gives you one shelf to cook and and it increases the cooking time if you have, let's say a two layer cake or two pies, but it is very worth it. You can either have a cake that takes twice the amount of time but turns out perfectly or you can have a cake where one of the layers has racing stripes from the elements.Toaster Oven:No can do. The oven has too much space to be a genuine toaster oven. I have a true toaster oven when I want the speed and direct "heat" of a toaster oven. It really does not make great toast because of this so I also have a true toaster, I mean come on now, toaster ovens do not make great toast either.All in all I love this oven. I use it every single day. It has saved many a people from being choked out as well! The few flaws the oven has does not compare to the benefits that this oven provides. If you are thinking about buying this oven you need to stop thinking and purchase it... it is calling your name!!!
This was book that really put Andrew Weil on the map and public speaker circuit and it was totally deserved. A wonderful mix of Weil's personal journey of being disaffected with the medical system, his travels abroad to look for answers he could only find at home, stories of patients that taught him key concepts about the body's inherent capacity to heal itself, and discussion of herbal and mind/body research that has influenced his work are only some of the main concepts he expounds upon in this volume. The main crux of the book is short and sweet: the body can heal itself because it is a healing system.Weil links the lack of doctor's belief in this healing system directly to their education. Medical students work in teaching hospitals populated by patients who represent only one end of the total spectrum of illness - the very sick. Since in this group healing responses occur less frequently than in the general population, doctors develop pessimistic attitudes that are applied across the board to all seen patients in their practice and often these attitudes are conveyed through thoughtless remarks that are the equivalent of a &quot;medical curse&quot;. These powerful words expressing little optimism for healing are often internalized by the patient (although a chosen few will rebel and fight against them just to prove the doctor wrong) and rob the patient of belief in their own capacity to respond to their illness.Building on these concepts, Weil describes several of his patients and friends who, against traditional medical odds, have undergone &quot;unexplained&quot; spontaneous healing often from life-threatening conditions. In almost all cases, acceptance of the illness rather than struggle characterized a key part of the healing process and indicated a mental shift that Weil believes can initiate a transformation of the personality with it a healing of the disease. It's a relief for anyone finding hope for the medical profession while reading this book that Weil has begun a revolutionary medical school program in his home state of Arizona that begins to incorporate many of the &quot;radical&quot; ideas found in this book. This is a medical volume that should be on everyone's shelf.
I picked this up at the library since I didn't recall reading it. What a horrible borefest. It drags on and on and on. Even the first few chapters are completely repetetive. In short, he had a poor three-part short story that he turned into a dreadful three part novel.
This album is testimony to the truth that all those hours you spent as a teen locked in your room playing air guitar will eventually come back to haunt you. I don't know much about these guys, but it's clear that there some serious metalhead residue lingering here. Naturally, since metalheads are viewed as bottom feeders in terms of musical tastes, these guys strive very hard to prove themselves worthy of a higher status. Eclectism is the new redeeming virtue and all the rage, so they eagerly opt for that. However, no matter how well they dress it up, they most basic influences are still in clear view.I suppose they call this emo because it's got those annoying, high-pitched, nasally vocals that is considered &quot;emotive&quot; but in M.V. vocalist Bixler's case, sounds most of the time like a spastic and very effeminate version of Maynard James Keenan. That's not the end of the Tool presence here (perhaps a bit of Carcass too -- who knows?), which is found in the lyrics, song titles and artwork to a noticeable extent. And when Bixler's not doing his whiny Keenan thing, he sounds like any one of a number of very bad New Wave of Heavy Metal vocalists from bands best lost to history. No surprise then that there more than a few unmistakable Iron Maiden moments littered through the disc.As for the songs -- it's the return of prog rock: complicated for complicated's sake. It's a mish-mashed, crazy quilt style of pastiche, stringing together or layering different musical ideas without interest in complementariness. Case in point: &quot;drunkship of lanterns&quot; is about as coherent and cohesive as its title suggests. It begins with a hyper-paced Santana-ish grindgroove, with bits of rockish quips and esoteric winks dancing about and Bixler screeching about god knows what on top, then it collapses into something that sounds like free jazz but isn't really, then shifts back to the previous uptempo hodge-podge it started with. It's a holy mess of a song on an epic Emerson Lake and Palmer scale. So too is &quot;cicatriz esp,&quot; which tries to slow down in midsong into a jazzy interlude that's more reminiscent of Iron Maiden's &quot;Strange World&quot; than anything jazz that then flips into something that sounds suspiciously like Sabbath's pre-electronica &quot;FX&quot; before hoolaing off into another Santana-esque whirlwind. At their most coherent, the songs on this album are something like eclectized Incubus (which is suburbanized Nirvana, which is..., etc.), and the lyrics, when not being pretentious (it doesn't get more pretentious than &quot;You must have been phlegmatic in stature&quot;), are adolescent. The guitar solong/noodling that often tries to be jazzy (I have to comment of this, being a guitarist) is flashy, noisy and ultimately distracting and useless -- think really vapid Scofield imitations by a graceless rock musician who's listened to too much heavy metal.I'm giving this album two stars because, like any pretentious prog rock opus, it had to take a generous and impressive amount of effort and determination (and hubris) to pull the whole byzantine operation off. But beyond that I can seriously pass on this CD. Plenty have already been dazzled by this band, and I'm sure there'll be more. However, for me, it's too much faux jazz, too much nonsense and too many Tool and Maiden flashbacks all at once, and it leaves me tired and far from dazzled.
I bought this album based on the song "Chasing Cars" I first heard when VH1 played the video. I like Coldplay, which this band has been compared to in both sound and song topics. So my feeling is you will appreciate this band a bit more if you already enjoy some of Coldplay's hits.For me, this is an album that has gotten better the more I have listened to it. When I first popped in the CD, I kept skipping over just to get to "Chasing Cars" (which in my mind will be this band's answer to Coldplay's monster hit "Yellow" about five years ago), a beautiful haunting tune that builds and builds to the point you wish it could go on longer. I was not taken immediately with the other songs. That changed with a few more long car trips.Now, the tracks listed as 1,2,3,4,8,and 9 are constantly being rotated on my daily commutes. I have grown to like this album with repeated listenings. I have to say the lyrics are nothing critics will be raving about. Lines like "I want to be the car crash/Not the traffic jam," which opens "Headlights on Dark Roads(#9)," may make you do a double-take the first couple of times through and you will easily see why the album is called "Eyes Open" as looking into someone's eyes is a theme played out in many songs.If you want a combination of good guitar driven melodies, some fast, some more haunting and relaxing, and are not expecting Dylan-like or Bono-esque lyrics, give "Eyes Open" a try.
This is our daughter's favorite album from birth. 16 months later, she is still enthralled with every single song, especially the song about brushing your teeth. From start to end, every song gives it's own unique character to such a colorful album. I recommend this album to all, and I think it would make a wonderful Shower gift!
This is one of the best Angel records period. This pales only to On Earth As It Is In Heaven for greatness. That is their defining album. This will be rereleased with the debut later this month on one CD. Now if only On Earth As It Is In Heaven will be rereleased as well......
I spent a good deal of money on what I thought would be the last fry pan I would ever own. It's backed by a lifetime warranty, so how can you loose? Well, let me tell you. The lifetime warranty covers manufacturing defects like bubbles and chips. But, there are more ways for the fry pan to fail than are covered by the lifetime warranty.I've owned this for about a year. I've never used metal utensils, never put it into the dishwasher, and never cleaned it with steel wool. Over the time I've owned it, the pan developed a sheen to it. Without warning, one day the pan just stopped being non-stick. Now everything sticks, even with liberal amounts of butter or oil. I wrote to Scanpan to ask them about their lifetime warranty. They sent me two pages of photographs of situations which aren't covered. What seems like normal use to me might look like over-heating to them, which voids the warranty.The problem is Scanpan puts a large metal disc on the bottom, which appears to be designed to provide even heating. What it does in practice is a) requires a long time to heat up and b) burns the corners since this is a square pan with a heavy round disc.So, I'm buying another brand today, much cheaper. Why spend a fortune on a pan which only lasts a year when a cheaper pan will do the same job at a fraction of the price? I cannot recommend Scanpan products.edit: I just received the Calphalon Contemporary Nonstick 11-Inch Square Griddle, purchased here from Amazon and I'm much happier. It takes a lot less time to heat up, looks better, and has a better non-stick finish than this more expensive one. It doesn't have the heavy metal disc on the bottom so I don't have to wait as long for it to warm up and the corners are in less of a danger of being burnt. Save your money. Don't buy from a company who will not honor their so-called lifetime warranty. I didn't get any more use out of this pan than far less expensive models. Use the money you save to buy yourself a nice steak.
Please don't buy this movie it really sucks. The cover looks cool and the description sounds cool but it will all trick you. The story starts off good but then it gets stranger as you continue.
This is a strange bundle for plotting. The Weems & Plath #255 Protractor is wonderful, but it is meant to eliminate the need for parallel rulers, so I'm puzzled as to why this kit includes both. You'll be much better served just getting the #255 Protractor, which is an updated version of the very handy Breton/Portland Plotter. Instead of using parallel rulers to "walk" a bearing or course from your position to the compass rose printed on the chart, you can just put the #255 Protractor on your desired course, turn the built-in dial until North is up and the grid lines are parallel to the latitude/longitude lines on the chart, and then read the degree heading directly off the protractor (no need to "walk" it over to the printed compass rose at all!). It saves a lot of time. I don't know why anyone would continue to use parallel rulers (or triangles, etc.).The dividers in this kit also aren't great due to some sloppiness in the joint, which detracts from their precision. You'll be better served by the Weems & Plath "Ultralight Dividers," which have a thumbscrew that allows for much more precise and secure measurements.As for the pencil... personally, I'd rather have a 0.7mm mechanical pencil. Go to an art supply or office store and get a high quality drafting pencil. I think it makes cleaner marks and is easier than constantly sharpening.I like Weems & Plath equipment, but considering that one tool (the 255 Protractor) is designed to eliminate the need for the other (the parallel rulers), this bundle doesn't seem very thoughtfully put together.
Until this camera, Fuji was consistently my favorite camera brand within the compact category (I am not a professional photographer, as I imagine you aren't if you're looking at this camera in the first place). But we'll get to all that in a second.Pros:-Extraordinary price for a 4 megapixel compact camera with 3x optical zoom.-Scene modes make it easy for newbies to get the proper settings for optimal pictures without knowing what the heck white balance and shutter speed are.-Sliding lens cover physically protects your lens against scratches from other objects in your pocket, like keys-A wide variety of manual options for those who are interested in learning about how to use them.Cons (and there are many):-Image quality is SIGNIFICANTLY worse than other Fuji cameras. I was so disappointed when I uploaded those first few shots! Fuji, why did you scrap your good sensor and replace it with this piece of junk?-Menus are extraordinarly tedious to navigate. Fuji should have mapped more controls to seperate buttons instead of grouping almost all of them together in one big menu.-Zoom/navigation button is difficult to manipulate, especially with only one hand on the camera.-Amazon's official review says that speed is a priority with this camera, but the start-up time is almost 3 seconds on average (as compared to the Exilim line's 0.5 to 1.0 second times) and the shutter speed is average (as compared to the Exilim line's .05 second shutter speed).-The sliding lens cover does not protect against dust at all, and feels very flimsy (made of plastic). Constantly feels like it's going to break off.Moral of the story: you get what you pay for. Invest in a 3 megapixel camera in the same price range, or bite the bullet and pay more money for a better 4.
I have been impressed by the quality of this bakeware set, and particularly with how truly non-stick the non-stick is. You could pay this much for junky merchandise; this is the real deal. KitchenAid continues to make sure their brand stands for deluxe quality at acceptable prices. Nice item.
I bought this system for my office after I had installed a 2415 at my home. I was in the honeymoon period at home and decided that we needed the same at the office. Initally everything was as good as advertised. The receptionist (who loved the features) thought she was in heaven and life was good.Then the handsets started failing, one after the other. Eventually, like my handsets at home, they all failed- every single one. Siemens was very distant and unhelpful, although they replaced the handsets the replacements failed more rapidly (I suspect they were "factory reconditioned") After the warranty was up, Siemens would only offer to sell me more handsets.Now the base, whose LCD screen no longer works, sits on a side table. People use it to make outside calls and answer pages. They comment on the styling (I agree with that), and remark on the sound quality (quite good on the base). They ask what the antenna is for, and I tell them not to ask.... they don't want to know.
The Carolina Cousins series is an excellent collection for adults and young teen readers. It has some wonderful spritual lessons and it has some incredible motivational properties. Although it has elements of wholesome Christian values, it is very tasteful and it does not over state these elements. It is not a fanatical series. This series would be great for secondary grade students. I'd like to see this type of reading in our school system and not so much goth or mystical mayhem. I have the full series of the Carolina Cousins. Each book is best read in sequence. I read the first book out of sequence and then I wanted more. The book had a list of the series so I ordered all of the books on Amazon. I've just started reading The Soldier's Lady and I cannot put it down. Lots of energy and twists. Wonderful historical fiction. This is good wholesome Christian literature. The story takes place in the post-Civil War era. African Americans are trying to find their way in a society that diligently tries to hang on to the slave system that made any White man with a dream a wealthy baron.
These sweat pants actually look good. They follow the body lines through the hips and thighs, but are still the same sweat pant material that are popular for lounging around the house in. The pants have a loose fit from just above the knee down, and do not have the old school elastic at the ankle but hemmed instead.
Sam Peckinpah is usually considered a very good director, but he was something more than that.Wild Bunch is a bloody mess in one aspect, but it is integral to the story.A particular strong point is Peckinpah's ability to use the entire wide screen, especially in the film's lead up to the orgy of death that ends the gang and a lot of Mexican hooligans in uniform. What makes that so difficult is the the original aspect ration was 2.20-1 while most of the DVD offerings cut most films down to 1.85. Some of that is understandable. There were 70mm prints of the film shown at some theaters and that was spectacular, particularly for the time, forth years ago.I've seen bad Peckinpah films and the truth is that even his less than stellar projects are an eyeful and interesting. Wild Bunch doesn't have many flaws and none are significant. Character actors are a gathering of the best.
I took reservation right away when Muller started quoting Ghandi with Christ. Great topic and I'm sure the principles are sound but there is no true rest with Christ and mixture.
Through Christopher's voice, the author managed to transport both to a new world, and to open my eyes to the world experienced by the autistic that move among us. I now understand a bit better what it must be like to love someone like Christopher, who really doesn't know how to reciprocate those feelings in a conventional, tangible way. I am awed by the patience of teachers like Siobbhan. And I was completely enchanged by Christopher. While I was sensitive to the pain and conflict all around him, I was enchanted by Christopher, start to finish.
I just moved into a new house and I needed someplace to put my ties, belts, shoe polish, and cologne. This item fits the bill perfectly. I like the fact that this model has the ledge on top so you can store items on top of it. The ledge has a raised surface on the edges so nothing stored on top can roll off. For the price, it feels well made. The cedar smells great too. The description says you can hold 4 belts, but I think you can easily get 6 on here as the hook is wide enough and appears to be strong enough. I plan on buying the matching shoe racks. I highly recommend this unit.
If you're looking for non-surgical ways to lose weight, the best track is FEWER CALORIES & EXERCISE. Eating smaller meals is one way to reduce caloric intake. Eating the same size meals with fewer calories is another. Or, lastly, stop the food that you injest from actually being absorbed by your body.Alli works on the principle of the latter, by blocking your body's ability to digest injested fat. And, in contrast to a lot of ads you might see on television, IT WORKS! YAY! I really have to congratulate whatever scientists actually figured out how to do this.Ok, but here's the downside. IT WORKS. Your body doesn't digest the fat, so it just goes through the rest of your digestive tract... and causes all sorts of unpleasant side effects along the way. They're really unpleasant. Seriously. I can't begin to convey how remarkably unpleasant they actually are. No matter what you heard, you will not be prepared. I actually took prescription Orlistat when it came out a few years ago, and, after stopping due to the side effects, I was *still* not prepared when I started Alli again recently.On the other hand, the side effects give you this great incentive to stay away from the pizza & deep fried chicken!!!For me, I eat remarkably healthy most of the time. I try and basically eliminate the need for Alli. But every so often, I get dragged to a business/social dinner or have to travel with few healthy food options available to me. In those cases where eating poorly is totally unavoidable, it's really nice to have Alli in my pocket.
Huge mess, NO color change at all. It did, however, stain the bathtub slightly with its sticky green gray mud.
A week before my immunology final, I had finally had it with trying to understand the whole conceptual basis of the immune system from my lecture notes and Parham's &quot;The Immune System.&quot; Both were great at giving me a detailed, granular understanding of mechanisms of each interaction, but I needed a higher-level overview of why the mechanisms were appropriate, how they interacted, and which component would respond to each class of threat.Sompayrac's book is witty, fun reading. It isn't overly simplified, and will require some effort if you're a complete beginner to the field; but if you're a student, it's an invaluable resource to supplement your textbook. You can get the detailed description from the textbook; but from reading this, you'll understand why the mechanism is important.My main regret is that I didn't think of searching for this book and buying it at the beginning of my class instead of a week before the final.FWIW, I supplemented the Parham book with this one, and also the High-Yield Immunology book to give a detailed outline. I received an A-; I think if I had gotten both at the start, it would have been an A.
Finaly a book that teels the truth. It teels how Israeli solidiers massacred Palestinians. It's a must read for everyone who wants to know the truth.
Litweiler's &quot;Freedom Principle&quot; is a pretty good book if you know nothing about &quot;free jazz&quot; (a terrible label, by the way) and want to learn about the dominant performers in the music. He provides some interesting commentary on Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, Sun Ra, Albert Ayler, Cecil Taylor, AACM members, and the European performers. Considering when the book was published, it is somewhat out-dated, since many of the artists he mentions (that are still living, of course) have gone on to develop their creativity far beyond the point where Litweiler begins and ends his analysis of it.Litweiler also develops some perspectives that seem rather off to me. For example, he says that &quot;Among the great jazz musicians, Ayler's emotional range may be the most limited&quot; (p.151). Ayler's music, in my opinion, is quite the opposite. When discussing Miles Davis' fusion period, he states &quot;the content of his music declined to a search for the new idea or effect, and innovation became valueless&quot; (p.224). Considering how many artists have been inspired by Miles' late 60s-mid 70s period (e.g., there have been a flood of reissues documenting this period of his career, and new people are discovering and loving his music from this period every day), this statement seems to be a little too bold, if not totally erroneous. Miles made the most challenging and innovative fusion music of the 70s, and his creativity inspired and influenced not only jazz musicians of the period but also funk and rock musicians. The textures he explored on those early 70s albums are as artful and challenging as anything before or since. He also claims that Sun Ra's love for popular music is a weakness: &quot;Sun Ra's most impenetrable music, as composer and improviser, has been influenced by the most flabby kinds of popular musics. He is the only jazz musician who ever recorded a version of 'Holiday for Strings'&quot; (p.143). Maybe it is just me, but I find the implied tone of the last sentence a little insulting to Sun Ra and his magnificent legacy. Such commentary smacks of elitist arrogance.This aside, I must say that Litweiler's book about Ornette Coleman is excellent. Compared with &quot;The Freedom Principle,&quot; it is like day and night--I almost wonder if they were written by the same person.
This one doesn't have the humor of Coben's buddy novels, but it's a good, fast, suspense story. I enjoyed it as much as his others.It reminded me of a good James Patterson book.
I bought this cd back in 2005 on a vacation in Atlanta and let me tell you this, it never left my cars cd player. Me and my best friend could not get enough. I love that they included the 1991 Hit "I'm still waiting". When they say love they mean it on this one. It's another phenomenal body of work from a R&B master, wow!!!!!
Very happy with these torches. Definitely a cut above those cheap tiki torches you see everywhere. Anticipate years of service from them.
I've done other TMS workouts and really enjoyed them, so I thought I'd try yoga. First off, unless you have never, ever done yoga before, Yoga Basics is a throw-away. It's just a series of sun salutations, almost identical to ones you do in the later sections. Yoga Burn was the only truely enjoyable section, although it didn't fully come through on its claim to raise my heartrate. It did you up a bit, but not enough to burn anything. Yoga for Flexibility was fine, TMS is not really known for their stretch routines. In both of the toning workouts I was distracted by the instructor. Lara is clearly a pilates teachers who quickly learned some yoga postures for this video. This does give me hope for her pilates videos at least. Overall, I think that this is a yoga workout for people who don't like yoga.
Here we have Mediterranian type (Greeks), yet Hollywood can't get away from showing most of the actors with --BLUE eyes. Blue eues? Get real!Supposedly this film it is to attract primarily an American audience, but the actors have British accents who can't but wait to say Sire versus Sir. What's wrong with the neutral American accent? Worse. This film took every opportunity to show needless smutty (nudes) sex.
After reading so many good books by authors with semi-italian names, like Lisa Scottoline (a wonderful, amazing author!), the name David Baldacci called my attention. Then, I took THE WINNER. That was my first try on his books.The plot revolves around a woman called LuAnn, who is the mother of a baby and lives with a man who only cares for drinking, a vagabond. Besides, she works has a waitress half the day to make only a very little money. Then, one day, a man called Jackson tells her she can win the national lottery. How? He has all the numbers of the next draw. LuAnn doesn't know, but if she say yes, she'll be one of the most rich women of the world. If she say no, she'll be a dead woman.Decided to say no because she's not the kind of woman to accept illegal things, she arrives at home and finds a man decided to kill... the man she lives with. But the man is already dead. Then some things I'm not going to tell happen, and she start thinking she's the main suspect of the crime (both her &quot;husband&quot; and the man she found on her home (a trailer) are found dead). Trying to escape from the police, she accept Jackson's opportunity and goes to New York, where she wins the lottery. This is just the beginning of a wonderful book, one of the best thrillers I've ever read during my whole life (which is not a big time, but was lived with intensity), and I discovered one of the best writers of the world. He criated an adorable heroine, you just can't help but fall in love with LuAnn Tyler, and also one of the most terrible vilains of the modern literature, Mr. Jackson.Now, all I'm looking forward to is to read the other books by David Baldacci. He's a marvelous writer. Believe me when I say it. Read Baldacci will be an habit now to me. Long life to David Baldacci! He deserves all the success he has been conquering. Just amazing!Marco Aurelio.
Now Jabez was more honorable than his brothers, and his mother called his name Jabez, saying, "Because I bore him in pain." And Jabez called on the God of Israel saying, "Oh, that You would bless me indeed, and enlarge my territory, that Your hand would be with me, and that You would keep me from evil, that I may not cause pain!" So God granted him what he requested.1 Chronicles 4:9-10Hardly a week goes by without someone asking me for a critique of this book. The Prayer of Jabez is a small, easy-to-read 92-page book written by Bruce Wilkinson, founder of Walk Thru the Bible. It seems to have appeared out of nowhere and has been riding at the top of the New York Times bestseller list for several months. It retails for $9.99 in the non-leather format.When I first heard about The Prayer of Jabez, it sounded to me like some kind of evangelical health-and-wealth, name-it-and-claim it type of doctrine. Naturally, I was suspicious. I bought a copy to review it for myself. Several of the Bible Study leaders in my fellowship group asked me to do an evaluation of the book. What I have to say in this seminar was the result of that study.First, I do think there are some commendable things in this book. I like the fact that it has stirred people's interest in prayer. Many who have read the book have testified that it has revitalized their prayer lives. I also appreciate Bruce Wilkinson's stress on the need for dependence upon God. I like how Wilkinson highlights the fact that when we pray for God to bless us, we are recognizing the fact that true blessing is something only God can confer on us.Jabez is someone for us to emulate. He valued God's blessing, and Scripture commends him for that, calling him "more honourable than his brethren." I am very glad that because of Bruce Wilkinson's book, Jabez will from now on be thought of as something more than just the answer to a difficult trivia question.Everything Scripture has to say about Jabez is found in 1 Chronicles 4:9-10, in the middle of one of those lengthy genealogical tables. It is a wonderful passage of Scripture and a great example of prayer, but it greatly overstates the case to suggest, as Bruce Wilkinson seems to do, that this passage alone is some kind of secret key that unlocks all the blessings God has in store for believers. To treat Jabez's prayer as a mantra to be recited word for word, is to misconstrue the whole intent of the passage.In the preface to the book, Bruce Wilkinson writes,Dear Reader,I want to teach you how to pray a daring prayer that God always answers. It is brief--only one sentence with four parts--and tucked away in the Bible, but I believe it contains the key to a life of extraordinary favor with God.Wilkinson recounts how he was introduced to this prayer while at Dallas Theological Seminary, when the seminary chaplain, Dr. Richard Seume, challenged students to seek to do more for God. According to Wilkinson, Seume said, "Want a bigger vision for your life? Sign up to be a gimper for God."A gimper, as Seume explained it, was someone who always does a little more than what's required or expected. In the furniture business, for example, gimping is putting the finishing touches on the upholstery, patiently applying the ornamental extras that are a mark of quality and value.Wilkinson says he went home and prayed, "Lord, I think I want to be a gimper for you.""But," he writes, "I was puzzled. What exactly did Jabez do to rise above the rest? Why did God answer his prayer?"Wilkinson says,I picked up my Bible and read verse 10--the prayer of Jabez. Something in his prayer would explain the mystery. It had to. . . . I bent over my Bible, and reading the prayer over and over, I searched with all my heart for the future God had for someone as ordinary as I.The next morning, I prayed Jabez's prayer word for word.And the next. And the next. Thirty years later, I haven't stopped.If you were to ask me what sentence--other than my prayer for salvation--has revolutionized my life and my ministry the most, I would tell you that it was the cry of a gimper named Jabez.And Wilkinson goes on for the rest of the book to urge his readers to begin praying the prayer of Jabez just as he has--word for word--on a daily basis.Without going into laborious detail about all the things great and small that I feel warrant criticism in this book, let me categorize the major problems in three broad categories. First, Bruce Wilkinson has--1. A wrong view of PrayerMost of what Bruce Wilkinson says about prayer is poor advice, and some of it is directly opposed to what Jesus taught about how to pray.Wilkinson writes,Recently, I was in Dallas to teach on the Jabez blessing to an audience of 9,000. Later over lunch, a man said to me, "Bruce, I heard you preach the message of Jabez fifteen years ago, and I haven't stopped praying it. The change has been so overwhelming I have just never stopped."Across the table, another friend agreed. He said he'd been praying Jabez's little prayer for ten years with similar results. The man next to him, a heart surgeon from Indianapolis, said he had been praying it for five.I told them, "Friends, I've been praying Jabez for more than half my life!"Notice that he is not talking about praying like Jabez. He's not suggesting that he incorporated similar requests into a prayer of his own. He is talking about reciting the words of 1 Chronicles 4:10 as if it were a magic formula or a mantra.He sets forth a six-step, thirty-day program to help us make reciting the words of this prayer a habit. Here are the first two steps of the six-step plan:1. Pray the Jabez prayer every morning, and keep a record of your daily prayer by marking off a calendar or a chart you make especially for that purpose.2. Write out the prayer and tape it in your Bible, in your day-timer, or some other place where you'll be reminded of your new vision.That is a horribly deficient view of prayer. When the disciples came to Jesus and said, "Lord, teach us to pray," He did not point them to 1 Chronicles 4:10 and suggest that they recite it daily. He gave them a model prayer. And even the Lord's Prayer is was only a model; it was not supposed to become a mantra for us to recite."A healthy prayer commitment according to God's Word has more facets of variety than can be squeezed out of two verses in one Bible book."-- Dr. James Rosscup.Throughout The Prayer of Jabez, Bruce Wilkinson continually suggests that the only reason we are not blessed by God is that we do not ask for the blessing. In one place he quotes James 4:2, "Ye have not, because ye ask not."But nowhere in the book does he ever highlight the balance of that truth, which James gives us immediately in verse 3: "Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts."When we pray, we're supposed to pray that God's will might be done on earth, not that our wills might be imposed on heaven.Second, The Prayer of Jabez seems to be based on--2. A wrong view of ProsperityThroughout The Prayer of Jabez, Bruce Wilkinson portrays divine blessings in terms of miracles, material blessings, and mundane popularity. Those are the only kinds of blessings he seems capable of imagining. And he laces his message with personal anecdotes that illustrate heavenly blessings in terms of earthly success."If Jabez had worked on Wall Street, he might have prayed, 'Lord, increase the value of my investment portfolios.'"--Bruce Wilkinson (p. 31)."Is it Bruce's message that we should pray for a BMW? . . . No, but if that's what you want, ask for it, and if that would convince you of God's love for you, then it might be granted."--David Kopp, editor, The Prayer of Jabez (Fort Worth Star Telegram, May 19, 2001)."God favors those who ask. He holds back nothing from those who want and earnestly long for what He wants"--Bruce Wilkinson (p. 76).Starting on page 25 of The Prayer of Jabez, Wilkinson tells an imaginary story about Mr. Jones, who goes to heaven and is given the obligatory tour by St. Peter. And along the way, he sees a massive building filled floor to ceiling with gift-wrapped boxes. And these boxes have people's names on them. Jones asks if there is a box for him, and there is, so Peter reluctantly lets Jones open his box:"There in Mr. Jones's box are all the blessings that God wanted to give him while he was on earth . . . but Mr. Jones had never asked... If you didn't ask Him for a blessing yesterday, you didn't get all that you were supposed to have."Here's a third category of complaint I have with this book: The whole thing is based on-3. A wrong view of ProvidenceWilkinson writes:In my mind's eye, I picture Jabez standing before a massive gate recessed into a sky-high wall. Weighed down by the sorrow of his past and the dreariness of his present, he sees before him only impossibility--a future shut off. But raising his hands to heaven, he cries out, "Father, oh, Father! Please bless me! And what I really mean is . . . bless me a lot!"With the last word, the transformation begins. He hears a tremendous crack. Then a groan. Then a rumble as the huge gate swings away from him in a wide arc. There, stretching to the horizon, are fields of blessings.And Jabez steps forward into another life. -- (pp. 22-23).Whenever you hear someone peddling any formula that is designed to launch you immediately to a higher plane of Christianity, you are being offered a fraud.Here's a similar rule of thumb: Whenever someone tells you God works only by miracles, where the natural flow of things is supernaturally interrupted by some special divine intervention, you are listening to someone who does not understand or appreciate the sovereignty of God in Providence.This is one of the most glaring errors in The Prayer of Jabez: Bruce Wilkinson apparently thinks that unless God intervenes in our lives miraculously, He is not working at all. He sees the hand of God only in miracles, and never in daily acts of providence.When was the last time God worked through you in such a way that you knew beyond a doubt that God had done it? In fact, when was the last time you saw miracles happen on a regular basis in your life?--(pp. 15-16).If God has to do a miracle before you know beyond the shadow of a doubt that He is working, you have a seriously deficient faith. Miracles, by definition, do not happen on a regular basis in anyone's life.God normally works through Providence. God is working even when His power is not being displayed in miracles.And if you think when we get to heaven we're going to hear God lamenting what He wanted to do but we wouldn't let Him, you have a seriously defective view of God. The God of Scripture declares that He will accomplish all His pleasure (Isaiah 46:10).Not only is Bruce Wilkinson's idea of God too small; his confidence in fallen, sinful humanity is too great:"When you take little steps, you don't need God"--(p. 44).How contrary that is to Jesus' words in John 15:5: "without me ye can do nothing."Furthermore, the idea of taking risky steps so that you'll know you are depending on God strikes me as the sin of ________________.Listen to this section from pages 47-48 of the book:It is a frightening and utterly exhilarating truth, isn't it? As God's chosen, blessed sons and daughters, we are expected to attempt something large enough that failure is guaranteed . . . unless God steps in. Take a minute to prayerfully try to comprehend how contrary that truth is to everything you would humanly choose:* It goes against common sense.* It contradicts your previous life experience.* It seems to disregard your feelings, training, and need for security.* It sets you up to look like a fool and a loser.Yet it is God's plan for his most-honored servants.Bruce Wilkinson is advising people to put the Lord to the test, in defiance of the biblical command against doing that--all because he has the mistaken notion that if God is going to work in our lives, he must do it by miraculous intervention, rather than by His daily, moment-by-moment providence.In short, this book and its popularity pose a serious danger to the evangelical movement and our understanding of what prayer is and what good praying ought to be like. For a corrective, I would recommend almost anything by E. M. Bounds, John MacArthur's Alone with God(which contains an excellent study of the Lord's prayer), or any of the great Puritan works on prayer, beginning with Matthew Henry's A Method for Prayer, recently reprinted by Christian Focus Publications in Scotland.The Prayer of JabezA Sermon (No. 994) Delivered by C. H. SPURGEONAt the Metropolitan Tabernacle, Newington"Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed!"--1 Chronicles 4:10.We know very little about Jabez, except that he was more honorable than his brethren, and that he was called Jabez because his mother bare him with sorrow. It will sometimes happen that where there is the most sorrow in the antecedents, there will be the most pleasure in the sequel. As the furious storm gives place to the clear sunshine, so the night of weeping precedes the morning of joy. Sorrow the harbinger; gladness the prince it ushers in. Cowper says:--"The path of sorrow, and that path alone,Leads to the place where sorrow is unknown."To a great extent we find that we must sow in tears before we can reap in joy. Many of our works for Christ have cost us tears. Difficulties and disappointments have wrung our soul with anguish. Yet those projects that have cost us more than ordinary sorrow, have often turned out to be the most honorable of our undertakings. While our grief called the offspring of desire "Benoni," the son of my sorrow, our faith has been afterwards able to give it a name of delight, "Benjamin," the son of my right hand. You may expect a blessing in serving God if you are enabled to persevere under many discouragements. The ship is often long coming home, because detained on the road by excess of cargo. Expect her freight to be the better when she reaches the port. More honorable than his brethren was the child whom his mother bore with sorrow. As for this Jabez, whose aim was so well pointed, his fame so far sounded, his name so lastingly embalmed--he was a man of prayer. The honor he enjoyed would not have been worth having if it had not been vigorously contested and equitably won. His devotion was the key to his promotion. Those are the best honors that come from God, the award of grace with the acknowledgment of service. When Jacob was surnamed Israel, he received his princedom after a memorable night of prayer. Surely it was far more honorable to him than if it had been bestowed upon him as a flattering destinction by some earthly emperor. The best honor is that which a man gains in communion with the Most High. Jabez, we are told, was more honorable than his brethren, and his prayer is forthwith recorded, as if to intimate that he was also more prayerful than his brethren. We are told of what petitions his prayer consisted. All through it was very significant and instructive. We have only time to take one clause of it--indeed, that one clause may be said to comprehend the rest: "Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed!" I commend it as a prayer for yourselves, dear brethren and sisters; one which will be available at all seasons; a prayer to begin Christian life with, a prayer to end it with, a prayer which would never be unseasonable in your joys or in your sorrows.Oh that thou, the God of Israel, the covenant God, would bless me indeed! The very pith of the prayer seems to lie in that word, "indeed." There are many varieties of blessing. Some are blessings only in name: they gratify our wishes for a moment, but permanently disappoint our expectations. They charm the eye, but pall on the taste. Others are mere temporary blessings: they perish with the using. Though for awhile they regale the senses, they cannot satisfy the higher cravings of the soul. But, "Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed!" I wot whom God blesseth shall be blessed. The thing good in itself is bestowed with the good-will of the giver, and shall be productive of so much good fortune to the recipient that it may well be esteemed as a blessing "indeed," for there is nothing comparable to it. Let the grace of God prompt it, let the choice of God appoint it, let the bounty of God confer it, and then the endowment shall be something godlike indeed; something worthy of the lips that pronounce the benediction, and verily to be craved by every one who seeks honor that is substantial and enduring. "Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed!" Think it over, and you will see that there is a depth of meaning in the expression.We may set this in contrast with human blessings: "Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed!" It is very delightful to be blessed by our parents, and those venerable friends whose benedictions come from their hearts, and are backed up by their prayers. Many a poor man has had no other legacy to leave his children except his blessing, but the blessing of an honest, holy, Christian father is a rich treasure to his son. One might well feel it were a thing to be deplored through life if he had lost a parent's blessing. We like to have it. The blessing of our spiritual parents is consolatory. Though we believe in no priestcraft, we like to live in the affections of those who were the means of bringing us to Christ, and from whose lips we were instructed in the things of God. And how very precious is the blessing of the poor! I do not wonder that Job treasured that up as a sweet thing. "When the ear heard me, then it blessed me." If you have relieved the widow and the fatherless, and their thanks are returned to you in benediction, it is no mean reward. But, dear friends, after all--all that parents, relatives, saints, and grateful persons can do in the way of blessing, falls very far short of what we desire to have. O Lord, we would have the blessings of our fellow-creatures, the blessings that come from their hearts; but, "Oh that Thou wouldest bless me indeed!" for thou canst bless with authority. Their blessings may be but words, but thine are effectual. They may often wish what they cannot do, and desire to give what they have not at their own disposal, but thy will is omnipotent. Thou didst create the world with but a word. O that such omnipotence would now bespeak me thy blessing! Other blessings may bring us some tiny cheer, but in thy favor is life. Other blessings are mere tittles in comparison with thy blessing; for thy blessing is the title "to an inheritance incorruptible" and unfading, to "a kingdom which cannot be moved." Well therefore might David pray in another place, "With thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever." Perhaps in this place, Jabez may have put the blessing of God in contrast with the blessings of men. Men will bless thee when thou doest well for thyself. They will praise the man who is successful in business. Nothing succeeds like success. Nothing has so much the approval of the general public as a man's prosperity. Alas! they do not weigh men's actions in the balances of the sanctuary, but in quite other scales. You will find those about you who will commend you if you are prosperous; or like Job's comforters, condemn you if you suffer adversity. Perhaps there may be some feature about their blessings that may please you, because you feel you deserve them. They commend you for your patriotism: you have been a patriot. They commend you for your generosity: you know you have been self-sacrificing. Well, but after all, what is there in the verdict of man? At a trial, the verdict of the policeman who stands in the court, or of the spectators who sit in the court-house, amounts to just nothing. The man who is being tried feels that the only thing that is of importance at all will be the verdict of the jury, and the sentence of the judge. So it will little avail us whatever we may do, how others commend or censure. Their blessings are not of any great value. But, "Oh that thou wouldest bless me," that thou wouldest say, "Well done, good and faithful servant." Commend thou the feeble service that through thy grace my heart has rendered. That will be to bless me indeed.Men are sometimes blessed in a very fulsome sense by flattery. There are always those who, like the fox in the fable, hope to gain the cheese by praising the crow. They never saw such plumage, and no voice could be so sweet as yours. The whole of their mind is set, not on you, but on what they are to gain by you. The race of flatterers is never extinct, though the flattered usually flatter themselves it is so. They may conceive that men flatter others, but all is so palpable and transparent when heaped upon themselves, that they accept it with a great deal of self-complacency, as being perhaps a little exaggerated, but after all exceedingly near the truth. We are not very apt to take a large discount off the praises that others offer us; yet, were we wise, we should press to our bosom those who censure us; and we should always keep at arm's length those who praise us, for those who censure us to our face cannot possibly be making a market of us; but with regard to those who extol us, rising early, and using loud sentences of praise, we may suspect, and we shall very seldom be unjust in the suspicion, that there is some other motive in the praise which they render to us than that which appears on the surface. Young man, art thou placed in a position where God honors thee? Beware of flatterers. Or hast thou come into a large estate? Hast thou abundance? There are always flies where there is honey. Beware of flattery. Young woman, art thou fair to look upon? There will be those about thee that will have their designs, perhaps their evil designs, in lauding thy beauty. Beware of flatterers. Turn thou aside from all these who have honey on their tongue, because of the poison of asps that is under it. Bethink thee of Solomon's caution, "meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips." Cry to God, "Deliver thou me from all this vain adulation, which nauseates my soul." So shalt thou pray to him the more fervently, "Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed!" Let me have thy benediction, which never says more than it means; which never gives less than it promises. If you take then the prayer of Jabez as being put in contrast with the benedictions which come from men, you see much force in it.But we may put it in another light, and compare the blessing Jabez craved with those blessings that are temporal and transient. There are many bounties given to us mercifully by God for which we are bound to be very grateful; but we must not set too much store by them. We may accept them with gratitude, but we must not make them our idols. When we have them we have great need to cry, "Oh that thou wouldest bless me indeed, and make these inferior blessings real blessings;" and if we have them not, we should with greater vehemence cry, "Oh that we may be rich in faith, and if not blessed with these external favors, may we be blessed spiritually, and then we shall be blessed indeed."Let us review some of these mercies, and just say a word or two about them.One of the first cravings of men's hearts is wealth. So universal the desire to gain it, that we might almost say it is a natural instinct. How many have thought if they once possessed it they should be blessed indeed! but there are ten thousand proofs that happiness consists not in the abundance which a man possesseth. So many instances are well known to you all, that I need not quote any to show that riches are not a blessing indeed. They are rather apparently than really so. Hence, it has been well said, that when we see how much a man has we envy him; but could we see how little he enjoys we should pity him. Some that have had the most easy circumstances have had the most uneasy minds. Those who have acquired all they could wish, had their wishes been at all sane, have been led by the possession of what they had to be discontented because they had not more."Thus the base miser starves amidst his store, Broods o'er his gold, and griping still at more,Sits sadly pining, and believes he's poor."Nothing is more clear to any one who chooses to observe it, than that riches are not the chief good at whose advent sorrow flies, and in whose presence joy perennial springs. Full often wealth cozens the owner. Dainties are spread on his table, but his appetite fails, minstrels wait his bidding, but his ears are deaf to all the strains of music; holidays he may have as many as he pleases, but for him recreation has lost all its charms: or he is young, fortune has come to him by inheritance, and he makes pleasure his pursuit till sport becomes more irksome than work, and dissipation worse than drudgery. Ye know how riches make themselves wings; like the bird that roosted on the tree, they fly away. In sickness and despondency these ample means that once seemed to whisper, "Soul, take thine ease," prove themselves to be poor comforters. In death they even tend to make the pang of separation more acute, because there is the more to leave, the more to lose. We may well say, if we have wealth, "My God, put me not off with these husks; let me never make a god of the silver and the gold, the goods and the chattels, the estates and investments, which in thy providence thou hast given me. I beseech thee, bless me indeed. As for these worldly possessions, they will be my bane unless I have thy grace with them." And if you have not wealth, and perhaps the most of you will never have it, say, "My Father, thou hast denied me this outward and seeming good, enrich me with thy love, give me the gold of thy favor, bless me indeed; then allot to others whatever thou wilt, thou shalt divide my portion, my soul shall wait thy daily will; do thou bless me indeed, and I shall be content."Another transient blessing which our poor humanity fondly covets and eagerly pursues is fame. In this respect we would fain be more honorable than our brethren, and outstrip all our competitors. It seems natural to us all to wish to make a name, and gain some note in the circle we move in at any rate, and we wish to make that circle wider if we can. But here, as of riches, it is indisputable that the greatest fame does not bring with it any equal measure of gratification. Men, in seeking after notoriety or honor, have a degree of pleasure in the search which they do not always possess when they have gained their object. Some of the most famous men have also been the most wretched of the human race. If thou hast honor and fame, accept it; but let this prayer go up, "My God, bless thou me indeed, for what profit were it, if my name were in a thousand mouths, if thou shouldest spue it out of thy mouth? What matter, though my name were written on marble, if it were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life? These blessings are only apparently blessings, windy blessings, blessings that mock me. Give me thy blessing: then the honor which comes of thee will make me blessed indeed." If you happen to have lived in obscurity, and have never entered the lists for honors among your fellow-men, be content to run well your own course and fulfill truly your own vocation. To lack fame is not the most grievous of ills; it is worse to have it like the snow, that whitens the ground in the morning, and disappears in the heat of the day. What matters it to a dead man that men are talking of him? Get thou the blessing indeed.There is another temporal blessing which wise men desire, and legitimately may wish for rather than the other two--the blessing of health. Can we ever prize it sufficiently? To trifle with such a boon is the madness of folly. The highest eulogiums that can be passed on health would not be extravagant. He that has a healthy body is infinitely more blessed than he who is sickly, whatever his estates may be. Yet if I have health, my bones well set, and my muscles well strung, if I scarcely know an ache or pain, but can rise in the morning, and with elastic step go forth to labor, and cast myself upon my couch at night, and sleep the sleep of the happy, yet, oh let me not glory in my strength! In a moment it may fail me. A few short weeks may reduce the strong man to a skeleton. Consumption may set in, the cheek may pale with the shadow of death. Let not the strong man glory in his strength. The Lord "delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man." And let us not make our boast concerning these things. Say, thou that are in good health, "My God, bless me indeed. Give me the healthy soul. Heal me of my spiritual diseases. Jehovah Rophi come, and purge out the leprosy that is in my heart by nature: make me healthy in the heavenly sense, that I may not be put aside among the unclean, but allowed to stand amongst the congregation of thy saints. Bless my bodily health to me that I may use it rightly, spending the strength I have in thy service and to thy glory; otherwise, though blessed with health, I may not be blessed indeed." Some of you, dear friends, do not possess the great treasure of health. Wearisome days and nights are appointed you. Your bones are become an almanac, in which you note the changes of the weather. There is much about you that is fitted to excite pity. But I pray that you may have the blessing indeed, and I know what that is. I can heartily sympathise with a sister that said to me the other day, "I had such nearness to God when I was sick, such full assurance, and such joy in the Lord, and I regret to say I have lost it now; that I could almost wish to be ill again, if thereby I might have a renewal of communion with God." I have oftentimes looked gratefully back to my sick chamber. I am certain that I never did grow in grace one half so much anywhere as I have upon the bed of pain. It ought not to be so. Our joyous mercies ought to be great fertilizers to our spirit; but not unfrequently our griefs are more salutary than our joys. The pruning knife is best for some of us. Well, after all, whatever you have to suffer, of weakness, of debility, of pain, and anguish, may it be so attended with the divine presence, that this light affliction may work out for you a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, and so you may be blessed indeed.I will only dwell upon one more temporal mercy, which is very precious--I mean the blessing of home. I do not think any one can ever prize it too highly, or speak too well of it. What a blessing it is to have the fireside, and the dear relationships that gather round the word "Home," wife, children, father, brother, sister! Why, there are no songs in any language that are more full of music than those dedicated to "Mother." We hear a great deal about the German "Fatherland"--we like the sound. But the word, "Father," is the whole of it. The "land" is nothing: the "Father" is key to the music. There are many of us, I hope, blessed with a great many of these relationships. Do not let us be content to solace our souls with ties that must ere long be sundered. Let us ask that over and above them may come the blessing indeed. I thank thee, my God, for my earthly father; but oh, be thou my Father, then am I blessed indeed. I thank thee, my God, for a mother's love; but comfort thou my soul as one whom a mother comforteth, then am I blessed indeed. I thank thee, Savior, for the marriage bond; but be thou the bridegroom of my soul. I thank thee for the tie of brotherhood; but be thou my brother born for adversity, bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh. The home thou hast given me I prize, and thank thee for it; but I
This is a travelogue. I didn't expect an expose or a documentary, but I was somehow expecting more than I got.I think it was only about 9 minutes long. After watching what can best be described as a mini-letter box format, I was glad it wasn't longer. I will watch it next time on my laptop.I needed this to see what Haiti looked like in the WWII era. So I got what I needed.
I bought this years ago in a maroon color. It still works beautifully. I love that I can choose the cup size and grind type!! I read in a coffee making book how long you should grind per grind size and this machine is spot on! I normally use a flavored coffee which gets kinda stuck to the blades, but it cleans off easily. I'm very happy with this!
These guys were amongst the most popular of the CT rappers. They had a few hip-hop classics, most notably "The Human Jock Box" which had the finest human beat-boxing on record, next to Wise from Stetasonic. That had many single then this album dropped. They got played on Yo! Mtv Raps, but then disappeared.Until the "Third Unheard: CT hip-hop album dropped, I did not know that they were a part of crews back in the start of it all. They were on a major label and got plenty of spins on WBLS, but then they were gone. "Where is they now?"
These are not in stores around my area for very long before they are gone. I will order from Amazon because they are really good for a 100 calorie snack.
I'm a day trader and trade stocks, ETF's, and options. I always looking for new ideas to help me screen for "buy candidates." I thought this book might have some new twist on technical indicators. When I opened it up, I was disappointed. I literally read the book, cover to cover in 10 minutes. I went though it quickly because the material was so simple. Basically the theory in the book is as follows: 6 phases of a stock. Recovery Phase (50SMA &lt; 200SMA, Close > 50SMA), Accumulation phase (Close > 50SMA, Close > 200SMA, 50SMA &lt; 200 SMA),etc.... same simple concept for the other four phases. Then for the grand finale,the last chapter "Putting it all together"...drum roll.... Was a review of the previous six chapters.. happy holidays.
I've been reading through this text over the past several weeks.I have been reading chapters of interest only (I do want to complete the book someday, right now, I'm chapter surfing)!Pastor Wiersbe gives suggestions on how to bring messages alive.It does take a little more effort; however, I believe it's worth the extra work.As the title of the book states, it is focused on bringing our messages alive.Alive in Sunday morning Devotion.Alive in the Sunday School lesson.Alive in the preached message in the pulpit.The text will help those who "Preach" as well as "Teach".I used some of his techniques last week at HOOPS4KIDZ in Milwaukee.I had to speak for two sessions, 30 minutes each to boys and girls ranging from ages five to seventeen. I believe the content and presentation (delivery) was well received. Glory To God!Appendix A: Teaches us how to transform messages from a sermon outline, into a message of hope. Pastor Wiersbe says, "Find one of your old sermons, and do these steps summarized in "Appendix A" and see a change!"Too often we find ourselves spoon-feeding our hearers with "Information"and not feeding them "the living Word". This surely is not intentional. We have biblical content, biblical text, biblical interpretation and the leading of the Holy Ghost. We are not trying to entertain anybody; we are attempting to convey life and hope.The main premise of the book is"to make our hearers, see the message with their eyes!"Allow me say this:Preachers & Teachers:This is neither a criticism nor an attempt to suggest you need improvement. Pastor Wiersbe is purely sharing his enthusiasm.God has surely anointed you to preach the Gospel.I highly recommend this book.I highly recommend this book to those who are willing to go that extra mile, to draw others into God's Kingdom!!!PeaceFellow Laborer In Christ JesusMichael(Youth Minister Volunteer)
What a wonderful concert. I watched the whole thing, the 100th club and the rehearsals and when it was over I said "It's over already"? :(Wow the 100th club, Siouxsie could stretch her arm and touch the audience on the head. They definitely outgrew that place a LONG time ago. She barely had any room for her dancing, but she was happy and her voice was astounding here. The temperature was perfect for her, they treated her good.At the Royal Festival Hall Siouxsie was freezing cold (poor thing)! She *effectively* complained 3 times through the show - with very colorful and spicy words! :DMy evaluation on some songs:Godzilla! - I had never heard this song before, the effects they play are strange but the song grown onto you pretty quick.Dear Prudence - I have seen better live versions of this song, but it was still pretty good.Christine - What a wonderful display of this song, I was never a fan of it, but I loved this live version; she did great!Shooting Sun - Never heard this song before, what a wonderful song and she made me fall in love with it.Kiss Them For Me - It was wonderful, I have seen Siouxsie perform this song many times, she didn't do too well a few times and I have to say this is the best I've seen her perform this.The Rapture - Oh it made me cry! The Rapture FINALLY LIVE AND WHOLE! Siouxsie forgot a couple of words on first paragraph, but from that point on; she made all the waiting for a wonderful Rapture live performance worthwhile. Thank you Siouxsie for including The Rapture I love you!!!!Pinned Down - One of her fast songs and it really shines here I love it.Happy House - LOL yes this song is about crazy people and Siouxsie makes it very obvious with her throwing herself on stage and those hand movements she makes. Gotta love it!Face To Face - Ok must admit although I've heard it for a long time, never really appreciated this song but all of a sudden one day I just decided to listen to it with more detail, so unlike me. I've learned to appreciate a beauty about it. However, the best cat song for her is "Loveless" nonetheless from Mantaray.Cities in Dust and Peek-A-Boo - wonderful I didn't think she would be able to do them because of her deeper voice. She did a great job.
This CD is pretty nice, I like that there isn't really any definite melody because my mind tends to fixate on a melody and won't let me sleep. I like being able to choose the length of nap. I choose a longer track than the nap I want to take because it takes a few minutes for me to fall asleep.The only drawback is that there are some strange, high pitched sounds in the background that often sound like either a fax machine or sirens in the distance. The lower pitched sounds are a lot more relaxing and I have a bit of a hard time with those high ones.That said, the tracks are helpful and the sounds at the end to wake you up aren't loud or obtrusive, but they do work. I appreciate that I don't wake up with my heart pounding from a jarring sound! I kind of wish there were some longer tracks for a day off when I have time for a longer nap!
Last summer (2004) I had the oppertunity to watch to me one of the greatest new shows of all time, The "4400",. At first I didnt know if it was a movie, mini series or a tv series but all I knew was that I had to watch it and man was I ever entertained. After the last episode, I was hoping it would return as a dvd and another seasen. Well next summer it will and the dvd is out and I had to buy it and I did.The show is about 4400 who have been missing for around half a cenary all of a sudden appear un aged and have no memory of what happened as if nothing strange happened to them. No one knows where have they been or who took them but all they know is each one of them has a special power.The dvd comes in 2 discs, with 2 episodes on one and 3 on the other. There arent special features (comentary, behinds the scenes. etc) but the dvd is still great since I can see the first season anytime I wantThe show was like a combination of the X Files and X- Men. It has a lot of action, romance and maybe some comedy in it.
I love the padded handles and the sharp guillotine action of the blade, but I've used it three times and each time, it pinches the pad on the inside of my hand under my index finger. The last time, it peeled back the skin and it bled a little bit. I've had dogs my entire life and always used a set of Millers-Forge, but bought these trimmers in a pinch because I've misplaced my good ones. I called Amazon and they're refunding my money and having me return the item. I wish they had worked for me because I like the idea of having the styptic powder stored in the handle.
The master of comedy doesn't dissapoint. He is a true comic genius and a master of his craft. Own all of his cd's you will never be tired of listening to them. Same goes for the DVD's he has out.
Chris Kattan was funny in this movie, it was a random purchase but Im glad I did, nice special effects and make-up, a kinda shocking ending. But overall its a solid movie.
"Modern Times" is an exceedingly well-written account of the history of the twentieth century--from the time of the First World War to the Nineties.With the skills of a superb storyteller, Paul Johnson manages to cover, in about 800 pages, all of the important events, personalities, issues, trends, and organizes them into twenty coherent essays. Drawing on his own formidable knowledge base and a wealth of source material vast and deep, his account of key historical events are fascinating, often accompanied by interesting and obscure details, such as private conversations between the key figures, contemporaneous commentaries, evidences recovered long after an event, etc., which are not on pages of most history books.Everyone who reads this book will discern the author's conservative undertone, although that tone has not interfered with the truthful presentation of historical events. Johnson does not only narrate; throughout the book, he quite liberally offers his own interpretation and causation analysis of events, and his assessment of the movers and shakers of their times. This conservative undertone, I must say, is Johnson's trademark. Johnson expresses his own sentiment judiciously and lets the reader judge his views along with his work.His conservative sentiments notwithstanding, I find Paul Johnson to be, first of all, credible, and then also balanced in his treatment of issues. (By balanced, I don't mean not taking sides; I mean presenting both sides.) Quite distinct from the ideologically predisposed, Johnson does not pull punches, even with figures he professedly admires.This is the second book of Paul Johnson's that I read, the first being "Intellectuals". I enjoyed both books tremendously. Although I am not as incensed as some reviewers about his liberal use of foreign phrases, titles and quotes within the text, often without English translation, I AM mildly annoyed by it. Overall, I highly recommend this book. I find it to be the most impressive of narrative history books. You will find it an excellent investment of your reading time.
Ok, not gonna lie, Family Guy is one of the worst shows on television. Why? Well, to start things off, its unoriginal. Let's think of the concept: a dumb, drunk, and irresponsible father, an insightful wife, a dumb son, a smart but unpopular daughter, a dog, and a baby, and a bunch of wild neighbors. Doesn't sound anything like the Simpsons, now does it?Also, it's not funny. I recently watched an episode cause my friend made me, and half the episode was taken up by Peter randomly fighting a chicken. Why? Because it's funny? No, because it takes up half the episode, and the writers are not clever enough to fill up a 30 min. time slot w/ commercials with jokes that are relevant. Which brings me to my next point: have you noticed how none of the jokes have anything to do with the plot? Thats because they're stolen!Another thing is that the show is so intent on being offensive that it loses any humor it does have. I'm not someone who is offended easily; the only thing that does is when something is vulgar for the sake of being vulgar, and Family Guy is indeed. By the way, American Beauty is my favorite movie.So please do not watch this show. Watch the Simpsons instead, something that has a brain!
There has been an industry in Kennedy assassination books, with nearly half of them ridiculous and nearly another half having no integrity. In my judgment, Mr. Posner's book belongs to the latter category.Posner's book not only contains errors, it brings nothing fresh to the controversy. Posner simply re-interpreted parts of the body of old evidence according to his inclination, and he is an awkward writer. But it is the body of evidence itself which is in question, or at least many important parts of it.Anyone interested in the Kennedy assassination couldn't help noticing this lamentable book being widely reviewed and praised in the mainline press. You must ask yourself, why would that be, when other very able books went largely ignored?The Warren Commission was only a prosecutor's brief, and a fairly poor one at that. Indeed, the Commission itself investigated almost nothing, relying entirely on Hoover's FBI for investigative work.Shortly before the Warren Report was released, Bertrand Russell issued sixteen questions about the assassination. Having seen an advance copy, he knew the Report would answer none of them.To this day, there is no answer to his questions, and most especially this one: "If, as we are told, Oswald was the lone assassin, where is the issue of national security?"In the case put forward by the Warren Commission, and echoed by writers like Posner, the assassination boils down to an ordinary murder which should be a matter of no secrecy.Russell's question echoes again and again down the decades as adjustments are made to the official story. Employing techniques one expects to be used for covering up long-term intelligence interests, various points raised by early independent researchers like Joachim Joesten have been conceded here or there along the way without altering the central finding. This is an effective method: concede details and appear open to new facts while always forcefully returning to the main point.A significant writer along these lines is Edward Jay Epstein, an author whose other writing suggests intelligence connections. His first book on the assassination, "Inquest," conceded numerous flaws in the Warren Report. Epstein went on in subsequent books, "Counterplot" and "Legend" to attack at length - and for the critical reader, quite unconvincingly - ideas of conspiracy, Oswald's intelligence connections, and his innocence.Posner's book is nothing more than a continuation along the same line of effort.If you only ever read one book on the Kennedy assassination, it should not be Posner's. That book should be "Conspiracy" by Anthony Summers(5 STARS) with absolutely first-class investigative journalism and a clear and compelling narrative."Conspiracy," now aging in some aspects, was startling when published, not startling because of extreme claims, but startling for its skilled marshaling of a huge body of facts. It is done so well, you will not be able to put it down.And if you still insist on reading Posner, you really owe it to yourself also to read Summers.
This film is a waste: It took millions of dollars, several actors and an actress who have done good work in past films, and two of Hollywood's most successful, if superficial, producers to make and what are the results? The plot is not only idiotic but totally predictable, the perfomances are laughingly bad and hammy, and even the special effects are boring. The entire film is more or less just a long Aerosmith video. The worst thing in this movie is Bruce Willis's speech to his daughter before he bravely sacrifices himself to save Earth from the big rock. It doesn't come off as a father who has always been unable to tell his daughter how much he loves her saying goodbye before saving humanity. It comes off as a jerk actor reciting lines, while thinking about his twenty-million paycheck and how he's making the audience cry.
The strong points of this book are excellent research and discriminating choice of famous retorts and comebacks. You'll see the well-known ones you expect, from wits such as Winston Churchill and Calvin Coolidge, but also a host of witty remarks from lesser known personages.I'm serious about how good the research is. I had wondered for years about a story concerning a retired engineer called in to fix an intractable problem. I had heard many variations, most of them with no details. This book identified the particulars: it was Charles Steinmetz of General Electric who famously sent the $10,000 bill, itemized with $1 for a chalk mark and $9999 for knowing where to put it.The introductions to each bit of repartee are OK, but they don't come off so well contrasted with the conciseness of the repartee itself. There's a fair bit of detail on the people and situations involved. Sometimes it helps accentuate the wit. Other times it seemed a bit superfluous to me.Overall, though, I recommend it. If you're a speaker looking for funny stories, you'll likely find a few. If you just like clever use of language, you'll find plenty of it. And it's a great book for a guestroom nightstand when you're done with it.
I got this as an upgrade to the previous version of the Homedock Deluxe for its added feature of displaying video titles onscreen. But it doesn't work. The list of TV shows is completely out of whack - episode titles appear randomly under different series folders. And long titles don't scroll so you can read them, like the ipod does.Tried the web based software update which did not work. DLO responded quickly to my question about it saying they had "no further information."I tried this new dock with an ipod video 5.5. I hear the video listing does not work at all with the latest ipods.So I'm going to return this and go back to using my old version of the unit - which has always worked well - except that the remote does break. I've gone thru 3. Don't replace the battery, just order a new remote direct from dlo.An added note though - some people have complained about distorted sound - I found that it was just a matter of turning down the volume of the homedock using the remote control - an feature I'm sure some people don't even know exists! This feature allows the homedock to make its audio signal quite hot - which is good for some videos that have very low audio levels (itunes tv shows for example) - but bad for most music mp3s which have a much hotter output.
Okay, as you've no doubt realised from reading the other reviews here, this book is controversial. It has two rape scenes, beginning with a man being raped by a woman (against both of their wills) and followed by him exacting revenge by visiting the same treatment upon her. I don't like rape. I'm always one of those people who call for tougher penalties in rape cases, and if I were a narrow minded person I might have condemned this book for featuring rapes.However, I must admit, I found this book utterly compelling. Sometimes it shocked me, I'll grant you, but this gave me a great excuse to explore my own feelings about the subject matter, and also gave me a view into the psyche of both the perpetrators and victims of such crimes. It was an intelligent work of fiction from a skillfull writer, and she didn't gloss over the realities of the situation. There were consequences of actions for the characters, who had both been essentially good people before being forced into a brutal situation not of their choosing, and they were also forced at later times to confront the feelings of guilt and shame that committing such acts brought out in them. They both grew from the experience, and became better people. They proved themselves worthy of forgiveness, and eventually love -- love that they both earned the hard way. I liked that. I like to think that people can redeem themselves, especially when they are not really bad people but rather just victims of tragic circumstance. Another thing, too, is that this book is set in medieval times, and they were harsh times. There was a reason they were called the dark ages -- dark things happened! To shine the light of modern ethics and standards on the behaviour of medieval characters is unrealistic.I liked this book. It was exceptionally well written for its genre. I liked that it dared to go beyond the normal light and fluffy boundaries of your usual romance books. I liked that it featured a PREGNANT woman as its sexy leading lady, proving that yes, pregnant women can be gorgeous, and men do find them attractive! And I liked that the story was utterly compelling, to the point where I couldn't put it down. I laughed. I cried. I FELT for the characters. I cared what happened to them. It was realistic enough that it made me forget it was a work of fiction.But when it all boils down to it, that's what this book is -- FICTION. The author clearly doesn't condone or encourage rape in any way. She is simply presenting us with a story, to entertain us, to make us think, to let us see the world from a different perspective. That's what the fantasy of books is all about. It's not the real world that you'll find in books. It's this other place, one where we can go to to see the things that aren't done in real life. And I for one enjoyed this book, and the places it took me to, controversial subject matter or no.I think there will be a few people who will refuse to read or enjoy this book for fear that by liking it they might be showing that they approve of rape. But think about it this way: if you watch a horrifying slasher flick, does that mean you want to go out and murder people? No! If you watch a movie about a junkie, does that mean you condone drug use? No! This is the same principle. You don't have to support what the characters are doing to like the book. And just because you may end up liking the characters, doesn't mean you have to like everything they do. Intelligent readers will figure that out, and look beyond the controversy to see what this really is -- a good book.
If you're after a somewhat professional-looking option for carrying your laptop and like the weight distribution only backpacks can give, there are precious few alternatives out there. The Mobile Edge is a definite contender for top spot and at $59, it can't be beat.I spent a good deal of time trying to figure out if my laptop would fit in this bag before ordering. I had purchased a slightly less professional looking but more trim and much more compact bag from Ellington (called the multi-tasker vertical pack). The Ellington was top quality and very, very well made, but my computer was about 1 inch too long to fit even without my protective sleeve. So sadly, back it went. I loved that bag.Mobile Edge says the Paris Backpack will fit a 15.4" laptop (just like the Ellington), however over the phone they stated a 17" would fit. As it turned out, I ended up finding the light-colored, two-toned bag at Circuit City ($79.99) while traveling in San Diego and was able to try it on for size. I found MY computer fit perfectly with maybe an inch left over. I have a Macbook Pro 15" which I keep in the Incase neoprene sleeve from Apple. The Macbook's outer dimensions are 14"W x 9 1/2"D and with the case, maybe an inch more. (Note: the "Wide" dimension becomes the "Long" when put into the backpack.) It's not at all necessary to keep your laptop in a sleeve like I do. The laptop compartment in the backpack is lined with soft, somewhat egg-crate like padding. It looks like it will give terrific protection to the laptop.I finally decided the light colored fabric was a little odd looking. Definitely distinctive, but after a day of deliberation, I was too concerned it would pick up dirt too easily and the potential "bleed " problem indicated by another reviewer clinched it for me. Having a dressy-looking but filthy case would kind of defeat the purpose so I returned it. I also thought the light colored fabric would make it look larger than black would. However, if you like the look and think you'd be able to keep it clean, ignore this comment. I ended up returning mine to Circuit City in northern CA and the woman behind the counter exclaimed she had never seen one before and quickly spirited it off to the back. I'm pretty sure she nabbed it immediately for herself. As I said, if you want a dressy backpack, there are few to choose from. I ended up ordering the all black version on-line from an Amazon seller for $59 (new). I received it in a matter of days in sealed new condition and luckily have ended up preferring the black.As far as quality goes, it's good, but not excellent. It's better than you'd find at Target, about on par with Marshall's, but nowhere near as well made as, say, Tumi or even Ellington. But it's nowhere near as expensive as Tumi would be if they even offered a product like this - which they don't. And though the price point is similar to Ellington (multi-tasker pack $89), it's MUCH more bag than the Ellington. With the zippered laptop compartment at the back AND two generous-sized zippered compartments underneath the flap that can take legal sized files one of which includes a zippered accessories pouch, the other which includes two zippered pockets and 3 velcro-flapped neoprene pockets, this bag can hold a LOT of stuff! Oh - and a cool little hidden zippered pocket at the side for a bottle of water. But it ends up bulkier than I'd prefer. I could have made-do with the more compact Ellington, but if you have a large laptop and carry a LOT of stuff, you'll appreciate the space in the Mobile Edge.Both the light colored and the black body fabrics are a little unusual and would not be my first choice. The light colored is fuzzy and tweedy and the black is slippery with a sheen and almost dressy. Not your normal backpack, briefcase or suitcase materials. Not sure where you'd see the light colored fabric, but you might find the black fabric in small purses and evening bags. The hardware seems solid and hopefully, won't peel or chip. The bag has faux-leather parts which look to me like thin vinyl. It would be fine if these parts were confined to decorative trim, but Mobile Edge used this material for the gigantic front flap as well as all the points which take the greatest stress - and in many cases placed rivets (!) at these points to secure them. Since vinyl tends to tear, I would have preferred they used nylon webbing which they actually did use at the adjustable base part of the straps. My hope is they know what they're doing and the "vinyl" won't end up being a problem. I have taken pictures of the connections at the top of the straps and as soon as I figure out how to get them posted here, I'll put them up so you can judge this for yourself. The way they handled it was unexpected to me.The bulk of the bag is a little more than necessary and if fully loaded, must weigh a ton. But the straps are curved, padded and the pack is well balanced and comfortable on the back. The very large front flap flops over and buckles at the lower front. One might be happy with this maybe for security reasons, but it tends to get in the way for me. The buckle isn't designed to be adjustable to the amount of stuff you actually pack so it can end up too loose or too tight and I find it a little awkward. The compartment for the laptop is at the back, behind where this flap attaches so handling the laptop is unaffected by it. I love this feature because there's nothing I hate more than going through airport security and having to completely upend everything just to get at my laptop. This way, all your stuff stays secured and untouched beneath the flap and fellow passengers can't see anything but the laptop and maybe a little of the dedicated laptop compartment. Great privacy, and since the laptop is secured not only by the zippered closure but also by a large, velcro strap beneath, you don't have to compromise laptop security, either.Overall, I'm happy with the Mobile Edge. I'm encouraged a company recognizes the need for women to protect shoulders and backs by giving us the option of a backpack AND understands we might not always need to carry all our camping gear to work with our laptops. But I wish the execution were more tight. I like the "less is more" design motto and this bag doesn't follow that principle. It's a little too floppy and bulky and the materials and execution are not of the highest quality. On the other hand, it doesn't cost anywhere near $500 so in the end, I have to admit Mobile Edge did a very good job with the Paris Backpack. At $59, any criticism is really quibbling.
Don't hold a charge, don't recharge well compared to other brands I have. Worst, all are long term more expensive than disposables. Brech-phooey. Wish the manufacturers would improve this product. I like recharging as contrasted with using and tossing.
We used this book in a masters-level special education course this summer. While Levine's work may be helpful to a parent who has little information about students with special needs and current educational practices, everything in this book has been said before by serious researchers in cognitive development and educational psychology. If you're an educator, you've seen it before and from much more reputable sources. Levine doesn't even give credit to the educational and psychological heavyweights that have already explored these ideas before he packaged them in this book. Levine also pushes for some things he wishes schools would do, when his recommendations are already considered "best practice" in most school systems, showing that while he may have vast clinical experience as a physician, he isn't as well-versed as he could be in current educational practice. This may well stem from the fact that parents came to him when their schools were failing them - and so he had limited experience with schools that are doing things the right way.In addition to the lack of originality and familiarity with current educational research and practice, there is the question of continuing to hold Levine up as a pediatric authority given the accusations and events that ended his medical practice and ultimately his life. While his suicide prevented the matter from ever being proven in a court of law, Levine surrendered his medical practice in more than one state following multiple accusations of misconduct with young patients in those states. The book includes more than one recommendation of matters that should be kept between young patient and doctor, where he recommends parents stay out of the conversation - creepy recommendations given what he was accused of. Given that his ideas can be found from many reputable education and medical sources, why use a source that is so tainted? Look to Gardener's work on Multiple Intelligences and you'll get everything you needed from Levine.
Saving Private Ryan contains what is unquestionably the finest 30 minutes of a war film ever made. From the landing up through taking most of the beach, Spielberg does a staggering job of presenting the American end of operation Overloard. This is not for the faint of heart, but nontheless this is somthing I reccomend to everyone (and watching it on home video is going to be a lot less daunting than on the big screen).Sadly, though, the movie falls apart in the second half. The stunning authenticity of the landing degenerates into war movie cliches and Norman Rockwell-style imagry. We've got the offhand dismissal of the British and Commonwealth contribution, even though they did most of the bleeding in the first weeks to take the heat of the Americans. We've got the by-now absolutely standard American ethically-diverse squad, each with his own identifiable personality trait. The final battle at the bridge has all the failings he so meticulously eliminated in the beach landing scene: the shockingly incompetant Germans (particularly the tank drivers), the heroic GIs (except, of course, for the one guy who has already been stereotyped as paniky), a perfectly-timed appearance by the cavalry, and a heroic and prolonged death scene for our hero. Ugh. You know, though, perhaps it wouldn't be so bad if the contrast *within the same film* wasn't so sharp.It seems that Spielberg is just intellectually incapable of avoiding melodrama. This would have been a much more compelling story if Spielberg had simply tried to tell a real story (as he did for the first 30 minutes) rather than making one up, but there you go I guess.Still, does the first 30 minutes make up for the last 90? Absolutely. The first 30 minutes is in my opinion absolute cinematic genius, a staggering accomplishment. But the split personality of this film is somewhat bizzare, and I wouldn't feel bad for skipping out as soon as Tom Hanks meets that paniky interpreter-guy. As good as Saving Private Ryan is (and it's pretty good), I can only hope this paves the way for a truly great World War II movie.
Like most parents of teenagers I am desperate for any insights to help my daughter navigate the treacherous shoals of her adolescence. I read Odd Girl Out and thought it was okay, but didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. Queen Bees and Wannabes, on the other hand, not only provided some new perspectives and insights, but much more importantly laid out practical steps that can help me help my daughter. My husband is reading it now, and he feels the same way. I highly recommend this book.
I actually made it through the movie, so shame on me for not having something better to do for over 90 minutes. This is the 3rd DVD title I've watched from Alpha and the quality is really lame. I don't expect perfection on movies from the 50's and earlier, but, flutter, colors going in and out and contrast changing in the middle of scenes is pretty bad. The copies I've watched look worse than what one would find on regular TV.
On the good times.I know I'm late writing this review, but honestly, I haven't even listened to this CD in years. Then one night I put it and and was reminded why I bought it in the first place. After I first heard "Never Give Up on the Good Times," I tracked that song down... Since I'm a big fan of funk and disco and grooves, and well..things I can just shake my booty to, this song is a winner. I like the retro feel it delivers, and while I hardly ever listen to the OTHER songs on the CD, I will listen to "Never Give Up..." over and over, so for that song alone I give it a solid five.
This book is not about the current rancor in D.C., even though there is quite a bit of that in here. It is about true conservatism towards the social compact that we all want to believe is there, and how that willingness to help the victim in the street, the person in the rubble, is what really makes a liberal.Contradictory? Only on its face. Keillor makes an argument based on his home front upbringing, which we all know iconicly exists in our nation somewhere, to create a powerful tale of a political belief grown from experience, not rhetoric.The prose is so evocative that I found myself reminded of my own past, my own development through education and example. This book is not so much a political treatis, but an appeal to our understanding that we are all people together.The writing, regardless of the political leanings, should be used as an example of how to write. Late at night, the day's work done, I cannot get the images out of my mind. I have found myself needing to read parts out loud to my family, having been struck by the power of the words.I was leary of starting this yesterday, but now I'm sorry I finished it. My next book cannot possibly match the power of Keillor's ability at the keyboard.
This book is simply key in helping you understand what a life in the Foreign Service is like. Several essays provide different insights into the ups and downs of living overseas and the unique challenges of the Foreign Service. You simply must read this before considering that career, and more importantly your spouse must read it also. Arguably, the spouse gives up more to join the Foreign Service. Until I read this book I was on the fence but not too far into the text I decided this wasn't for me or my family, which is really a great thing. If I relied on the State Department view I would have exerted significant time and effort only to find out later or too late. Some critics complain the book is too whiny, and it does come across like that at times. But look at it this way: if you read all the negatives and are still motivated, then the Foreign Service would be incredibly dense to NOT take you.One of the interesting takeaways for me was that your will likely be evacuated sometime in your career. If you or your spouse can't deal with the thought of flying the wife and kids out of a dangerous country, sitting on C-130 troop seats while the other stays in a dangerous situation, the Foreign Service isn't for you. If you don't mind living like a king overseas and living like a pauper in Washington, the Foreign Service may be for you. If you have to have fast access to pop-tarts you may think twice. If the thought of you or your kids contracting dysentery or other crazy diseases with less than great medical care bothers you, think again. If your spouse has career aspirations you need to seriously consider this option. Before you order that subscription to The Economist, get this book first.
I echo what everyone else has said but no-one has mentioned what I consider a drawback. There is no headlight. The convenience and flexibility of the unit are great. I purchased mine at Sears when it was on sale for $422.00.After comparing it to our old Eureka Whirlwind (as far a suction goes), it's easily obvious the DC18 has more suction. It's a nice benefit that our Eureka attachments do fit on the DC18's wand, so the tools can be repurposed to the new vacuum. The carpet pick up is not quite as good as I think it could be. I tested it by sprinkling various things on the floor like dirt and crumbled up crackers and chips as well as play doh. It did pick the items up and put them in the bin but I had to make two passes over the crackers to get them up. It seems that the vac doesn't pick up everything directly under the brush roll drive.The vac comes completely apart. You can take the machine apart all the way down to the frame easily. The hoses come right off as well as the head and the bin comes apart easily. The wand detaches from the hose so you can easily use it for detailing your car. This is one of the nice benefits to the vac, the versatility I mean.I ordered the dusting brush and the stiff brush as additional accessory items to go along with the DC18. I feel you need a dusting brush for TV and electronic items which atract static dust and I got the stiff brush to get those stubborn areas of the floor boards and bathroom corners.The hose will stretch long enough for you to clean a flight of stairs (13 steps). It's a wonderful thing to be able to stretch the hose that long and still maintain strong suction.It's a LOT of money for a vacuum and I'm banking on the durability as well as the "no loss of suction" claim. 5 years warrantee is a strong statement but as I think about it, our Eureka Whirlwind is 5 years old and I've only replaced belts on it and it was $149. So maybe 5 years warrantee is not saying much? I don't know just yet if the Dyson is worth the big $$$*****Edited*****OK, I've had the vac for a couple of months now and can say that, although its pretty good, it's not worth the extra money. If I had to do it all over again I'd have gotten the Kenmore because it's got better suction and is a more substantial vacuum cleaner. Kenmore model #36933. The dyson is OK but I'd consider it not better than the old Eureka whirlwind bagless we had for years. It is no to good for carpet. You have to go over and over the carpet because there is so much of the brush that is covered by the brush guard and the vac does not vac where the brush guard is. If I could change my score I'd change it to a 3 star.
This novel started out well, but halfway through degenerated into cheap romance, cliched writing, and a plotline straight out of a soap opera. I found myself unable to care about any of the characters or what happened to them. Hoffman insisted on telling us, rather than showing, the important details, a device which greatly weakens any writing. Oprah struck out on this one.
Two decades ago i bought Hellraiser on Laserdisc with a R rating, but on special features they had the two cutted scenes in it.On DVD i guess where 3 different releases, but all with the R rating.I`d hoped on Blue comes the Unrated version.Now i see it is hopeless,I like the movie very much but they dont get any money from me, for a R RATED version. I am sorry.
Once you've used a digital timer with direct entry you'll never want to go back to a model where you push and hold buttons while the time advances. This model has a feature many competitors don't; if you count down a time period you can bring the starting count back and do it again. This is very handy when you're doing a repetitive task like flipping a steak on the grill every few minutes.I'd give this model 5 stars if it had bigger buttons. Competitors like the Westbend get much better sized buttons into a smaller body. But the Westbend doesn't have the repeat time feature, so if you want that then this is the model to get, otherwise get the Westbend.
Joe Haldeman delivers a good, well considered novel that is Haldemanesque... in the sense that the enthusiasm that the book delivers and the original concepts he explores in his own unique way hold the plot together.I judge a good book on whether I can put it down, walk away from it and not think about it. In the case of Camouflage, I read it cover-to-cover and was sorry that the story was over. He left me wanting more and to me, that makes the grade.Other reviewers found a component of the book when the human and alien fell in love to be corny and unbelievable, but love does confound the wisest of us and I didn't think that it was nearly as big of a stretch.
Delightful novel of a young man and his friend who are sent to a high mountain village to be re-educated. Although nothing non-realisitc happens, the narrative has a magical-realism texture and beauty, contrasting nicely with what is usually a grim view of the period. Sijie has a light touch which brings out the human and the absurd. He also treats well the value of books and reading. An easy read with a little, delicate sexual content. The translation is elegant in itself. Would be an interesting follow-on to Red Scarf Girl if read in 7th or 8th grade.
This is a review of the quality of the Blu-ray disc, not the movie itself.Ever since this movie was first released, it has become one of my all time favorite movies. (Blade Runner is #1 on my list.)This movie on Blu-ray was supposedly "digitally remastered." This is one of the worst transfers to Blu-ray I have ever seen. Most of the frames have so much noise, that each frame looks like a stipple painting. (Stippling is a painting technique with a bunch of dots grouped close together.)Bottom line, this Blu-ray quality was so bad that it was distracting enough to reduce my enjoyment of the movie.It might be best to stay with a good DVD version of this movie until they release a better quality version on Blu-ray.
I bought this smoker after selling another brand prior to moving. I am very happy with it and love that you can load up the chute with smoke wood pucks and let this thing go for hours. Down sides include: no digital temp control, no built-in meat temp probe, and no digital temp readout of the cabinet interior (although it does have an analogue dial type temp probe stuck through the front door). Last but not least, it appears that you cannot buy any generic smoke wood pucks, but must buy the rather overpriced Bradley ones.I think you can get a model with more digital features, at a greater cost, but for the money, this unit performs well and has put out some good ribs, butt roasts and fish.
It's actually quite impossible to come up with something concerning the second collection of comics about Charley Bourne and his experiences during WWI that I haven't already mentioned in my review of the first collection.This amazing comic simply keeps going. It's still as exciting, still as detailed, and most importantly, still as well-written.However, while the good stuff keeps coming, so does the bad. The lack of color still hamper the realism, and this unfortunate fact is just as frustrating as before. Still, since all the good stuff continues to impress the reader, the overall impression is, once again, nothing but amazement. Not only that, this collection also has several quite abrupt and highly unexpected changes in the storylines, which is very positive. After all, that's how war is.Finally I just have to mention the fact that there's one scene in particular that, well, came out stronger and more intense that any other scene of war I've ever encountered in a comic. Obviously I won't tell you which one - I prefer not to include spoilers in my reviews - but just let me say that the tragedy of warfare, particularly World War I, suddenly becomes very vivid.
This is a very moving, historically very accurate journey to the last days of the Roman dominance in Europe.I especially liked the philosophical situations in this book. For example when Maximus (as a non-Christian) has a discussion with the bishop about the current situation. Thought provoking.Very nice and clever book.It is also a very useful book for historians to see the changes in warfare in the 4th/5th century seen coming alive not in a history book, but in a history novel. Very nice. The more dominant part of cavalry after the battle of Adrianopol gets pretty clear. And it gives a longer lasting impression if we see Quintius charging his cavalry against the barbarians, as if we just read in a history book, that the cavalry slowly replaced the infantery legion as the center part of the Roman army.While there seem to be parallels to the Gladiator movie, there are not really many. But I do think that the Gladiator script writer got some framework ideas from this book (the name Maximus, General of Rome against the barbarians, the idea he could be emperor etc.).Highly recommended.
I picked this at random and was very pleased. It had lots of action and also a lot of realistic behavior from our hero (and some action that definitely stretched my imagination!).I read this in a day and was sad to see no more novels by this author.
I have 3 pugs and thought this book would be adorable and I was right! It's cute and has witty titles for each photo :-)
The long section that describes Coleman's youth, from boxing to the decision to leave his family behind, is one of the miraculously sustained pieces of writing that Roth has ever done. There is not a single false note, and the imaginative identification is absolutely complete. This is not a novel about the problem of race in America, but about something that Roth has always been writing about: how to be an individual actor, a free agent, when you are tied inextricably, whether you want to be or not, to a group.Now, I'm not sure how a writer of Roth's talent could throw in parts like the Lester Farley monologues, where the author has clearly not really felt his way into the consciousness of the character, but outlined it with some commonplaces about Vietnam veterans, is beyond me. I suppose I admire the effort to even try to see what's going on inside the head of such a character - more so, certainly, that his attempt, well, not to get inside Delphine Roux's head, but to create a straw woman to be seen through by the author and his readers. She isn't taken seriously enough, given enough life, to be effective even as a satire.The book loses a lot of blood when Coleman is gone, but while he is walking through its pages The Human Stain is alive and vital. Worth your time as very few others are nowadays.
The "Welshman's Way" was my fourth book by this author and the fourth in the series of 14 books. I am now on book 5 and all of the stories so far a good,light romantic stories. They are not very racey. The love scenes are short and sweet for the most part. Nothing erotic in this series. The characters are very good. Not just the main characters but all of them.The nice thing is some of the characters show up in the other books in a very inventive way. Some of the characters turn out to be the main person in the next book. Good writing I guess you would say. So far I have really enjoyed the stories and each one has had a good and differnt plot. I am used to reading Berrice Smalls books that have very erotic love scenes. I wasn't sure if I would like this series but they are kind of refreshing but they could use a little more sexual romance. I have all 14 books and so far I have not read a bad or boring one.
This is one of those books for which you regret reaching the last page!. I devoured it from beginning to end in a few hours. Beautifuly written, beautiful pictures, nicely organized. Very enjoyable. Definitely a 5 stars purchase.
I purchased this BluRay DVD months ago based on 5-star reviews, but didn't watch it until yesterday. I know that musical taste is just that and quite personal, but this was one of the most boring performances I've ever watched (in spite of the slapsticks antics). First of all, the music is hardly first rate. Haydn wrote magnificent masses, but as an opera composer (in my opinion), he was not at the top of his field. This production tries hard to overcome this second-rate music and in doing so, makes the music even more trivial.I've watched it once and now it will stay on my shelf until I decide to bring it to a second hand store and get some money for it.So much for Amazon's star-rating system.
As soon as I saw the name Leon Klimovsky I knew I wanted to see this movie. The film "Werewolf Shadow" that he directed is one of my faves, and even though I knew Paul Naschy wasn't involved in this one, I hoped that some of his genius might have rubbed off. Plus I've been very impressed with all of the Spanish horror movies I have seen so far, so I was hoping for the best with this one too.But unfortunately this film was just not up to the standards of Naschy or de Ossorio.The problem this time out is that the script is just not that interesting. While watching this I found myself literally falling asleep and had to turn it off and watch the rest another day.Yes, Narciso Ib&aacute;&ntilde;ez Menta does make for a distinguished looking Dracula, and in other hands I think he could have gone down in history as one of the great ones. But unfortunately his character just doesn't get to do very much in this movie.The story has ol' Drac longing for a male heir because the family line is dying out (wait a sec, I thought vamps were supposed to be undead and immortal?). But his only male offspring is a twisted one-eyed deformity, so now he is placing all his hopes for the family's future on his pregnant granddaughter who is coming for a visit with her husband. (But it is never explained why she is not a vampire, and why she doesn't seem to know that the rest of the family are vampires.) Oh, and somehow these vampires can go out in daylight for short periods of time too -- or is that just more low-budget cost-cutting day-for-night filming in broad daylight? Yeah this plot doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense and is full of unanswered questions.When the film finally drags to a close, the ending is actually not that bad if you like black humour, but it just feels like getting there has been a pretty tedious chore.The DVD looks great and seems to be part of the same Spanish horror series that has been issuing very nice versions of the Naschy back catalogue. But this is one of the lesser entries in the annals of Spanish horror. Overall I would only recommend this movie to really die-hard hard-core fans of 70s Eurohorror. Everyone else can safely pass this one by without missing anything.
Before buying this cd I knew that Jimmy Thackery could be an outstanding rock blues guitarist and, from Amazon reviewers, I thought that David Raitt had a very good singing voice. Therefore, I excitedly looked forward to the arrival of That's It! However, after receiving That's It! and listening to it a few times, I am very disappointed. The vocals, guitar playing, and songs sound exactly like both David Raitt and Jimmy Thackery are neither energized nor inspired. They certainly do not energize or inspire me! The songs themselves on That's It! might be some forms of R and B or funk or something else. Who knows? What I do know is that only a couple of the songs on That's It! truly sound like the blues. (One might call That's It! "roadhouse blues", but neither performer exudes enough energy or excitement to use the "roadhouse blues" term properly.) What I also know is that I'll never again reach for That's It! to place the cd in my cd player. That's It! is such a flawed expression of the blues that there will always be a better example of the blues or rock blues that I'll want to hear first. Rather aimless cds like That's It! cause me to be a bit angry because such a disappointing experience as I've had with this cd, including both the time and the money I've wasted, makes me question, for just a moment, the life-long commmitment I've made to listening to and collecting great music. I'm also very disappointed by reviewers who give high evaluations to cds because they have no clear understanding about what truly is genuine high-quality music. My informed and strong advice to you is to forget about purchasing this cd.John
Some people just can't get this film. First, don't even try to compare it to the Cushing films, this one obviously wasn't intended to be anything like them. Second, it isn't some comedy meant to be filled with laughs, it is a subtle parody. The cast is perfect for the way the characters were intended to be portrayed, and the ending is quite clever, a purposefully anti-climactic finish that puts the dot at the end of this clever hairy dog joke of a film. I detract one star because, though I was surprised at the uniqueness of the film, it isn't one I'd watch repeatedly like the Cushing films.
I'm a big shredder user, and this one broke after 2 months of use. I wouldn't get it again.
I bought this for gaming on a laptop--so I don't wear out the keyboard or pummel important system components. I've got larger-than-average hands, and it fits really well. None of the components feel particularly cheap, and now that I've been using it for a year, the keys are "broken in" quite well. The only caution here is that when you rest your hand on the unit, your thumb will have a bit of a stretch to do, going from the "space bar" down at the bottom to the D-pad on the side, all the way up to the red button. I seldom use these, simply because I find them cumbersome. Other than that, it's an excellent piece of gaming hardware!
this book is the kind of book that when i was reading it, i didnt really like it, as i read it i would of gave it two stars. but now, coming from someone is has finshed the book, it is a good well written book that looking back on it you will be glad you gave it the time to read.
I did not really go into this book with any expectations. I enjoyed the opening chapters and was really disappointed when the book took a turn for the worst with the carrraige ride that would not end. It seemed to take up a third of the book.Though I generally like romance novels to end at the marraige or when the primary conflict between the couple has been resolved, I think this book left too many unanswered questions. How was Bathseheba received by society? Was there ever a reconciliation with the first husband's family? Did she continue with her art? Did Olivia and Peregrine grow up and fall in love? Did Bathsheba ever have Benedict's child? I ask this because there was some question, in my mind, at least, whether the pregnancy would be successful. Bathesheba did tell Benedict that she had several miscarraiges with her first husband.Maybe Ms. Chase is saving Olivia and Peregrine for another book. I would really be interested in reading their story.One thing I liked about this book is that the writer made it clear that Bathesheba loved Jack, and that he was a loving father and husband. So unlike other romances featuring widows which usually characterize the first husabnd and having a major character flaw.After having written this, I am changing this to a four star review. I think the mark of a good book is that the reader is so invested that she wonders about the fate of the characters even after the story has ended, as was the case for me with this one.
While I found this to be a good read and Wally Lamb to be an excellent writer, the book could have used a good editor. The parts that I thought I would hate, like Dominick Tempesta's memoirs, turned out to be my favorites. Good story.
First things first: do not expect Criterion Editions here -- the flicks are unrestored, with no subtitles, piled up on two-sided disks (two to the side) some of which stick even the first time out of the box. Overall, a low quality production, but what did you expect for thirty cents a flick?Believe it or not, I have watched them all (little by little; took like a couple of months). I really liked this set, despite its low quality -- and the reason is that it's a document of a long-gone era that I was not aware of: the few latest of these flicks were made when I was a tot, and the rest when my parents were (or even earlier). It's really a great learning experience -- and then, not all of them are total crap (though quite a few are). For example the ones with Astair are quite watchable, and so is the one with Abbott and Costello. A few films sport things that today would be considered racist: like a comical pair of happy but hapless Sambos, or another one with two white guys in blackface: you don't see this kind of thing anymore. And btw, I felt they're totally harmless. There's a disk full of soundies too (music videos of yesteryear). A few legends of the past appear in a few features here: people like Lena Horne, Nat King Cole, Artie Shaw, Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, and even Chuck Berry (duck walking, yes). None of the numbers are first class though. Still curious, no? I thought so.Overall, I'd say these flicks is like a history lesson + a handful aren't bad (although, let's be clear about it: none are good). Picture is unrestored, like I've already said: sometimes it jumps, sometimes it gets so dark, you can't make out anything, sometimes there's a lot of scratches. Sound mostly too low (although there's usually no crackle, so maybe they did clean it up a bit); in some movies volume is all over the place: music too low, so you turn it up; then music ends and dialog starts and it's too loud, so you gotta stay really perky and on alert with your remote to turn it down before it blows your windows out. This sort of thing.Bottom line: it's a pile of cheap but merry garbage, unquestionably of historical value, and sometimes tolerable artistically. I'm not sure it's for everyone, but personally, I liked it (a lot). And for the cheap price this is sold for you can't really go wrong, even if just for the sakes of a handful of those flicks here that are half-way decent. Recommended.
Its a nice size bottle.Kinda light black, but its ok.I didn't justify spending 20 or more on a bottle of ink, and based on positive reviews on other websites, I decided to buy these and so far have no issues.Keep in mind, every 2 cartridges or so, CLEAN YOUR FOUNTAIN PEN.If you don't clean your pen on a regular basis, it will clog and the flow would be constricted.Don't mix it with other ink, as mixing will clot the ink.if you are using a different kind of ink, clean and flush your pen throughouly before using this ink.
Most of these songs are album quality. A lot bring out the tranquil side of Billy Corgan with obscured and whir, and a great Iha song Blew Away. Then there are the agressive ones like hello kitty kat and pissant with lyrics like &quot;got me a raygun, got me an altitude, can't help feeling something's wrong with everyone of you.&quot; Then there is the cover of the fleetwood mac song landslide, which Billy sounds very good in. They should have done a double album here with Siamese Dream too like in Mellon Collie, but if you can shell out the extra cash, it's worth it.
Although I don't much care for the Dylan track, I really enjoy this album. My dad even noticed that one of the songs was used during a commercial for the Masters one year.
I used Pilot Razor Points for note taking in college and had almost forgotten about them since then, but I'm writing a lot these days and wanted the smooth, fluid writing experience again. Hard to find, but Amazon.com always comes to my rescue.
Reading some of these reviews, you wouldn't think they were talking about the same sweeper. People either give it five stars or one star. I bought this just to pick up dog hair in the kitchen and laundry room. The suction was terrible and the sweeper was messy to empty. I was so disappointed that I returned it after three days use.The Eureka 96B Boss Lite is the same price as the Bissell Go Vac, and it has amazing suction and battery life. I highly recommend the Eureka 96B Boss Lite instead of the Bissell Go Vac.
When I was much younger (in high school) I liked this series a lot. I made it all the way up to #6, Faith of the Fallen. At the time, I was able to ignore the hyper-violence, and the rapes, and how women were treated, and I was completely oblivious to the author's worked-in messaging about conservative dogma. I was able to enjoy the story as a story. As I have gotten older though, I have come to realize the messaging of the book is wrong for me, and the glorification of the violence done to men and women in the book, is not something I can read for entertainment, and certainly not something I can support.The first book is especially violent (when you encounter a character named Denna, brace yourself). The first book spends a lot of time establishing the setting world, and the rules of the world (additive and subtractive magic, ancient evils, etc.). The story itself, taken on its own merits, is fairly good. It has an uncovering-the-magical-past vibe to it that is fairly gripping. The rest of the books are equally violent (one of the punishments inflicted on captured women by an invading army is to "pass them around in the tents" for the soldiers to "use" -- and yes, it is as bad as that sounds. The entire series is EXTREMELY violent, and consists of the most vile and horrifying type of violence. To this day I remember some of the scenes I read with chills. The series also spends a lot of time harping on conservative ideas such as rape victims shouldn't choose abortion if they get pregnant as a result of the rape, and that private property and capitalism are THE way to go. (Not that I disagree with the free-market as a general rule, just making a point that the author makes this a big focus in the series -- ESPECIALLY in Faith of the Fallen).After the first book ... it just gets horrifying. There are numerous rapes of men and women (and attempted rapes). There is violence against women in general, torture (in detail, such as flaying the skin from a live victim), and other very adult, very dark, very unpleasant descriptions and story points. I want to make a point of emphasizing that they are STORY POINTS. They aren't scenes. In the first book, the male protagonist (Richard) is captured and spends a LARGE portion of the book being tortured and violated, etc. It isn't just a brief scene, it goes on for a LARGE part of the book, and the author makes every effort to try to make the reader sympathetic to the point of view of the attacker.The fantasy story itself is interesting, and if you can get past the rapes (which are so common, it would almost be comical, if it wasn't so horrifying) and general ugliness of the world the story is set in, then you may like this series. I, myself, only made it through the books I did due to my young age, and lack of a proper frame of reference. As an adult, I cannot stomach them anymore. It is almost IMPOSSIBLE to "skip the bad parts" because they are THAT laced with them.Like I said, the story itself and the world it is set in, is very good. You will like the story and want to know what happens next, if and only if you can overlook the negative points I have brought up in this review.2 stars if those negative points mean the same to you that they do to me. 4 or 5 stars if they don't.
I grew up in the 70's, which was unfortunately before many kids were being diagnosed with ADD. I've spent my entire life (I'm now in my 40's) not knowing I had a learning disorder and found myself depressed and anxious as an adult. Predictably, I was diagnosed as being clinically depressed and put on SSRI's, which didn't work. After years of toil and frustration (ADD will get much worse when left untreated!) I finally turned toward the idea that I might have ADD. I was close to making the appointment for prescription medication when I decided to give ATTEND a try. After just a week I could tell that my focus and energy was starting to improve and my depression was lifting.
Yeah, for sure Sick Puppy delvers laughs and perfectly delineated characters. Yah, for sure, you betcha! It's Fargo all the way, only transplanted east to the Little Apple, okay?I like Skink's new sidekick, Twilly, too, you bet! They sure make a great eco-hit team. Maybe they can get their own tape or DVD made of their exploits, kinda like them 911 tapes, you know? Yessirree, boy howdy, that'd be a kicker!
This is an extraordinary compilation of texts of environment and economics that constitutes a very helpful book to decision makers. I work for environment and always check this book to take the best decision, because its contents are wide enough for diferent topics of environmental problems.
Amazon.com entered under product details that this movie has closed caption. They were wrong. This movie doesn't have closed caption! I was looking forward to watch it and I was disappointed when it didn't have it. So, I will borrow a book from the library instead!Updated 6/16/06I just finished the book. It's very good! It's something I wanted to read again and again for refreshment as well as reminder of the truth about Jesus. At first I was confused because Nikki in the movie is a male in the book (Nick). The movie producer must have changed the gender for better sell?
I eagerly read the first four books of the Earth's Children series after my mother was done with them and even lent out Clan of the Cave Bear to my grandfather who is interested in prehistoric people. When he asked about further books in the series, we had to explain that they were about Ayla and not about prehistoric people.After 12 years, I was thrilled to hear that the fifth book was out, hoping that there would be an interesting plot when Ayla met the flathead-hating Zelandonii and some ghosts from Jondalar's past.Well, for the most part Jondalar's immediate family accepts the whole "flatheads-are-human-too" only minutes after hearing of Thonolan's death (which was quickly glossed over by some crying and then was all right as soon as Ayla demonstrated her "firestone") and most Zelandonii are at least open to the idea of flatheads = humans. There are a few dissenters, but the "meetings" that the people would have over flatheads seemed a little bureaucratic for a hunter-gatherer society.Marona's trick on Ayla seemed awfully contrived and I wonder if Auel asked a ten-year-old for advice on that setup. Like other reviewers, I also didn't like the concept of "trailer-trash" in a prehistoric setting. Brukeval and Zelandoni were fairly well-developed as characters and I sincerely hope that there will be more conflict with the former in the next novel (ie. Wolf kills Brukeval defending Ayla and the tribe calls for her banishment and Jondalar has to choose, etc...) but I doubt that will happen. As for Zelandoni and her obesity, most non-industrialized societies respect a woman with meat on her bones and so I was rather confused as to why "fat" was a pejorative term in this novel. Also, why is Ayla the only person across a continent and half who can fish with her bare hands when there's a dozen old timers around here who can smack walleye out of the river?And of course, Ayla has her baby with the cutsey name of Jonayla. Iza, Uba, Nezzie, Durc-ina ANYTHING other than a combination of their two names! Jonayla has a very small part in the novel other than being nursed a few times. Granted, she's a baby, but there was so much leading up to her birth. Don't get me started on Whinney's filly Gray (Cloud? Smoke? Mist?)Please, Mrs. Auel, give Ayla a fault or have her make a life-threatening mistake or at least tension-building (argue w/ Marthona over parenting or dinner, just don't feel like having sex with Jondalar, become allergic to wolves, something!) There was so much potential in this novel that you did not take advantage of!Actually, there are two things that bother me more than anything and they aren't in this novel, it's what they portend for the sixth. Willamar (wasn't he Willomar in 2-4?) promises to take Ayla to the Great Waters to see dolphins--meaning she'll be able to "talk" to them and go swimming with them and proclaimed a goddess by the locals. The other is that there is some evidence now that some prehistoric people from France managed to find their way to N. America by hunting seals along the ice cap. I am terrified that Auel has heard about this and now Ayla will be the first person and goddess of the Americas as well.Ayla's already taken Eurasia by storm ... now there's a possibility that she may come here as well ...

I wasn't going to watch this movie because I wasn't impressed with earlier versions but happened to see a few scenes at Blockbuster so gave it a shot. It was beautifully made and I fell in love with the characters and the plot. There were a few glicks that made no sense but overall it was an excellent movie that any kid would enjoy watching .I didn't care though for the comic book characterization of the cab driver but did enjoy the special effects. The film was awkward at several points --for instance -- why didn't the girl alien blow up more cars. Why didn't the cab driver get killed when knocked 30 feet through a wall. Why did it take so long for the cabby and the scientist to believe they were aliens. I suppose the next thing is the appearance of action figures on display at Blockbuster. But still with all that being said I still enjoyed watching the movie.
I'm a fan of Mr. Uris and when I saw this book in an airport before a long flight, I was excited. That excitement didn't last long. DO NOT BUY this book! It is shallow and was apparently rapidly written and edited. There are some glaring errors in the book and the main characters are stereotypical. I don't mind an author with an agenda - I love Gore Vidal, but don't agree with him on much politically - but there has to be something of value in the writing. Nothing here!
These are durable and easy to see. The are just what I was hoping for. They don't float though so be careful around water.
I have specialized in providing professional education and therapy to divorced, courting, and re/wedded couples since 1981. I am (a) 66, (b) a stepgrandson, stepson, and ex-stepfather and stepbrother, (c) an invited Board member of the Stepfamily Association of America, (d) a contributing editor to 'Your Stepfamily Online,' and (e) the author of six personal-growth and family-relations books.I recommend this book to people with a casual interest in sensing some surface aspects of the complex role of "stepparent." I do not recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand the core requisites for building high-nurturance, enduring stepfamily relationships."Your a Stepparent..." appears to be based on the author Cerquone's experience as a foster parent, interviews with some stepparents, and diligent research on the writings of some respected stepfamily authors. The result is well-intended - and of little practical value to serious readers, because he omits four essential topics:1) why and how to assess and reduce co-parents' psychological wounds from childhood;2) the origin and impacts of blocked grief in adults and kids, and how to spot and reduce it;3) co-parent unawareness of five key topics: (a) normal personality formation, composition, and function; (b) keys to high-nurturance families and relationships, (c) effective communication skills, (d) healthy 3-level grief, and (e) stepfamily realities and norms and implications. and...4) little effective re/marital and co-parenting help (i.e. courtship coaching, classes, informed counseling, co-parent support groups) available in most communities and the media.In my experience, these factors will often block the best-intentioned adults from following well-meant stepfamily advice, as in this book. If ignored, the factors inexorably promote choosing the wrong people to re/wed, for the wrong reasons, at the wrong time - and subsequent stresses and re/divorce. Awareness, acceptance, and discussion of these (and related) factors can reduce three of these stressors, and help to achieve high-nurturance stepfamilies.For more perspective on this review, see [...]
I have become rabid about avoiding trans fats and any product with partially hydrogenated oils that calim to have zero trans fat. This led to me shopping in health food stores/Whole Foods for anything in the cracker/cookie/snack category. I once searched for graham crackers and vanilla wafers with no partially hydrogenated oils in 3-4 supermarkets and couldn't find any, so I went to Whole Foods near my job. I saw these crackers and bought the Cheddar flavor and loved them. I have since bought the wheat and ranch flavors.Who doesn't love a snack with a serving size of 50 bunnies?!
I found this book to be a fast and informative read. I am neither a lighthouse enthusiast nor a Stevenson literary junkie but still managed to enjoy my time spent reading the book.I can see where this blend of biography, history, and engineering would be too thin to please serious lighthouse fans, literary historians, or marine engineers.However, for the general reader, the book succeeds nicely in combining a selected history of the Stevenson family, their works for the Northern Lighthouse Board, and the family's impact on Robert Louis Stevenson.It is an interesting account of the difficulties overcome in the creation of some of Scotland's most magnificent lighthouses. The author knows how to turn a fun phrase which adds to the reading a bit of an Easter egg hunt for bon mots.The typographical errors previously mentioned have been corrected in the paperback edition.
This series (and author) is one of my favorites. While I didn't care for the series finales' ending (in Jinian Star-Eye), all books in the Land of the True Game are well worth the read. And unlike so many books today, they are a manageable size. The three Mavin books are great, possibly the best in this unique and special series.
I must admit that haven't bought this DVD, but this performance was some time back broadcasted twice on Norwegian TV. I thought it would be interesting to watch Bartoli sing one of the sisters. What I found out was that it was a disappointment.First of all was the conducting tediously slow. And when I saw the first scene with the three men, I started to wonder if it was just me or did the one that played Guglielmo looked and sounded extremely bored. The Ferrando too wasn't too good. He could produce very beautiful tones, but could just hold them for a second and then a hideous vibrator would kick in. I normally love a vibrator under control, but he was truly awful to listen to. The only male performer that was very good, was the Don Alfonso. He acted and sounded the part very well.But something I just don't understand, was why on earth would the producer or conductor cast two mezzo sopranos as the sisters. As much as I love Cecila Bartoli's Rosina and Cenerentola, she is no Fiordiligi. She was much too low range for her, although her coloratura is gorgous. The one that played Dorabella sang well, but she seemed to have an even lower range than Baroli. It just didn't seem right to me. They were very pleasant to hear, but definatly not good for the dramatic effect. Agnes Baltsa's Despina was pure joy see both see and listen to.It is strange that the conductor would choose such an extremely slow tempo. It made the drama go with incrediblely short steps. It seemed to go on forever. And it made the opera almost boring to see, interupted by occational comic touches here and there. Neither Mozart's nor Da Ponte's humor made it through for me. I lated bought the Gardiner version on DVD and that was something else. All six singers were exceptional, the conducting was crisp, well timed and made the opera a joy to see. This one was very boring by comparsion.
This book is very well written, entertaining and relatively easy to follow. The A to Z format at first seems trivial but actually works pretty well. For a guy decades away from his last math class, it was a nice revisit.
I had this book sitting on my shelf for sometime since Oprah first recommended it. I happen to pick it up recently to take to the beach. I must admit it was not an easy read and there were many times when I wondered why I was reading it because it was so painful. The ending was not unexpected for me because I felt like we were always leading to a crescendo only I was secretly hoping it would have been a happy one. Needless to say, it was certainly more appropriate than anything sugar coated. I was truly emotionally touched by Ruth's wonderful ability to look past the imperfections of those around her. I completely agree with other reveiwers in that this is not a light read but one that will never totally leave your heart and soul. The book is well worth the effort.
Like a vaudeville show on acid...i know that line is stolen from Opie and Anthony but good Lord, that statement defines this album....if you're an axe murderer you'll love this album, if you like zappa you'll probably love this album, if you like patton you'll worship this album, if you like limp bizkit you should die, and finally, if you want to listen to some incredibly original, zany and genius music, you'll love this album.
Avatar stands out as one of the best shows Nick has ever done. The writers do an excellent job of addressing mature themes, despite the constraints placed on them when creating a "kids" show. The characters motivations are believable, the bending effects never fail to entertain, and Azula is one of the best villains I've ever seen. She's both absolutely competent and psychopathic; her arrival never bodes will for the heroes of the show. Season 2 is a must buy.
This is a hell of alot better than i expected. I was expecting to like maybe 5 or 6 tracks but all of them are good. Well worth the money.
House of Fog and Sand is absolutely breath-taking! Just when I thought Jennifer Connelly's best role was A Beautiful Mind, she astonishes me again! The ending of this beautiful movie is awesome, or as to quote Clay Smith of Access Hollywood, &quot;A surprise ending that will leave you breathless!&quot; I wouldn't trade this movie for anything.
..I know the nostalgia and charm of the first Shins album may cloud your judgement, but not mine, since I came to the band first through CTN. Firstly, the production on this album is bad. Frustrating. And they're using digital equipment, so theres no excuse. If it was recorded on a 4 track they'd have an excuse. It seems like Mercer was very inexperienced in making this and it shows. The vocals are unintelligible, sounds like there is a muffler over everything. That's not good.To me, the only song that really manages to punch through this is "New Slang", although the rest of it is growing on me. This is the kind of record that indie people love because it is far too frustrating for any mainstream music fan, who is used to clear crisp production, to really dig. The bottom line is, it just doesn't sound that good. But, the songs are still there. You just need to listen more closely.
It doesn't dry out my skin like some products, and it does work. I do think it needs a companion product to really do wonders. I am checking out the other products in this line to see if there is a day cream b/c this one is for night use.
This movie was touching and not at all what I was expecting. The movie is about a terrorist attack, but it focuses on how a woman (Michelle Williams) deals with the death of her son. It's emotional, heatbreaking and forgiving. Michelle Williams is extraordinary as usual. she had me in tears.
Really didn't do anything for me. Maybe I need to invest more time but I really like stuff that at least makes me feel like it is working and doesn't just give me a little bellyache.
to conclude that Dylan is deserving of all of the accolades he recieves.A note regarding a previous reviewer:IF this is the real A.J. Weberman, the same fool that harrassed Dylan's family in a craven attempt to achieve fame by invading and insinuating himself into Dylan's life, I suggest you move on with your own pathetic life and give it up already. Nobody cares what you think.
Works great and eaiser to read says not pregnant or pregnant. Not hard like the lines and plus signs. Those taking feritlity drugs may get false positive.
All I can say is why waste your money or time. This is so fakey it made me ill. I got to waste my time watching this poor dvd they call a movie. Beeing a Big Fan of Indy horror I was very well not pleased. This is TRASH...
Our daughter got this toy for her first birthday. It was an instant hit not only with her but with her dad and grandfather! Great music selection, brilliant interaction (being able to add instruments to the song is an awesome feature), extremely durable (our daughter immediately stood on it, which didn't affect it in the least). Only downside is the sound quality, which even for a kid's toy is pretty awful. All of the sounds are really tinny and scratchy. The piano and harp are decent reproductions, but the violin, french horn and clarinet are all shoddy electronic noises that bear little resemblance to the actual instruments. Overall, though, it's a great toy.
"84 Charing Cross Road" is a collection of letters over a 20-year period between Helene Hanff, who lived in New York, and Frank Doel (and others) of Marks & Co, a small bookseller in London, hence the title of the book.The second part of the volume "The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street" describes Hanff's first visit to London to meet many of the people she got to know through her letters, and to see many of the places made famous by English literature..Hanff is an acute observer of people and places, and she has a gift for capturing them in a few pithy words. She also has a dry sense of humour.Today, we buy our books online from Amazon and the like, or we drink coffee and browse in the commercial friendliness of a real bookshop. It's all very efficient, and we get inexpensive books, but it has no soul. "84 Charing Cross Road" is about a very different era, a time when a book-lover like Helene Hanff would write to her favourite bookseller, who would in turn write personally back to her about the books she wanted and his efforts to find them for her.When I lived in London twenty years ago, I frequently visited the wonderful bookshops that still existed along Charing Cross Road and the adjacent area. Labyrinths of shelves, piled to the ceiling. Even then they existed in a time warp, fending off the encroachments of Borders, Amazon and a host of other efficient booksellers. Maybe they are slowly disappearing now, just as 84 Charing Cross Road did when the owners died.Reading this book was a bitter-sweet experience for me. I look back on an idealised time through the rosiest of rose-tinted glasses and I mourn for the vanished days so evocatively described in this volume. Times when a small commercial transaction like buying books meant more than an impersonal exchange of printer matter for a credit card slip, when people had time to talk to each other as well.But perhaps it was never really so. We idealise the past, and books like this make very dangerous reading for lovers of English literature and history, because they encourage us to wallow in nostalgia.Readers who love books, not only for their contents, but also for their physical appeal and smell, will readily identify with this book. The internet and e-Books have a place as sources of information and enjoyment, but they cannot replace the tactile and sensual presence of real books. A real book, passed down the years, with its marks of time and perhaps inscriptions and notes by vanished readers, will always be a treasure.
I routinely read every book on Shakespeare that comes out. Most of them -- such as Will of the World -- speculate about this elusive figure without adding much to what we already know Shapiro's book is different It's a brilliant insight to add to the two main traditions of biographical studies of S -- his life as a working actor/manager and the intellectual roots of his plays plus the hints they give of his life and beliefs.Shapiro embeds S the playwright in the politics of his age, particularly Elizabeth's reign coming to an end, the Earl of Essex as a potential rebel, the alarms about a possible new Spanish Armada, and the latent underground Catholic opposition to the new regime that had broken up the rhythms and traditions of conservative England. He makes S the observer much more a man of his era than most comparable books. He offers many insights into the time and S's place in it.For me, there is only one test of a book on Shakespeare: does it send you back to reread the plays. This one did. His analysis of Julius Caesar is a significant new slant on the work. He gves me a richer sense of the always active mind of this complex man who was at the same time an intellectual, practical man of business, upward mobile money seeker -- and part of London's milieu.I rate this as an outstanding new contribution to Shakespeare studies
Dennis McNally has written the definitive history of the Grateful Dead, and despite his insider status, does not hesitate to reveal the unsavory aspects of the lead characters. McNally (who refers to himself as &quot;Scrib&quot; throughout this text) joined the Dead's circle in the 80's but focuses on the band's origins and early period. Some early chapters may cover only three months, while later chapters may span four or five years. Inserted throughout are interludes that detail the entire concert format of the modern (late 80s and 90s) period. Though not as compellingly described as Blair Jackson's Garcia biography, McNally confidently delivers the fruits of his obviously comprehensive research. He uses his backstage access to provide insight into to power of the Dead's extended family, especially the irascible road crew, and in the process canonizes &quot;Ram Rod&quot; Shurtliff and, to a lesser extent, Danny Rifkin. Changes in personnel are explored, included an early failed &quot;firing&quot; of Weir and Pigpen, and the dismissals of Tom Constanten, Keith and Donna Godchaux, Sam Cutler, and Dan Healy. Despite his unwillingness to lead and fear of confrontation, Garcia is shown to be the leader of the band, as in Jackson's book. McNally's work will not convert those who are not already fans, but it is a crucial addition to any serious Dead Head's library.
The other day the alarm went off and it was because the gas line in the fireplace wasn't shut off completely. This thing speaks to you and said CARBON MONOXIDE / FIREI am very impressed with the sensitivity of the product. You can't go wrong here.
Children who survived the Holocaust had a difficult time adjusting to post-Nazi Europe. The author tells the stories in their own words of 8 orphaned, homeless young adults as they struggled to create new lives out of the ashes of their horrific experiences. Because of the format of the book (it is divided into 4 sections, with quotes from each survivor in every part), it is difficult to remember which youth is which. I found myself looking back into previous sections to track that youth's particular story. A solid addition to the bibliography of Holocaust and post-Holocaust remembrances. Appropriate for ages 12 and up.
Remember the album covers those old AOR bands in the late seventies and early eighties put out? Bands such as Asia, Boston, and Journey -- you know, all those neat science-fantasy deals with spaceships and fantastic creatures and stuff? Didn't you wish that once you put the album on, the music inside would live up to the album cover? I mean, it wasn't bad music, and sonically it sounded pretty spacey with the keyboards and dreamy vocals and all, but the lyrics those bands wrote were ninety-five percent commerical crud that had nothing to do with the album covers.Well, Keldian sounds like those album covers looked. They are the best "space metal" band I have ever heard, unless you count Lost Horizon. Lost Horizon being, of course, the intergalactic champions of the music world, it isn't fair to compare them to anyone else. They are exponentially better than any other band of their type. So I won't compare Keldian to Lost Horizon, other than in broadly generic terms. It's hard to describe Keldian. Keldian sounds like the vocalist of A-Ha fronting a pop version of Pagan's Mind, only better. They sound like Asia with a power metal rhythym section. They sound like Luca Turilli if he had been born twenty years earlier and played eighties rock. They sound good, any way you slice it.Hard to believe this is a debut album; these are obviously veterans, regardless. Get in on the ground floor of a great new band and pick this one up.
It fit my Dell Inspiron 1525 (size 15.4") very well. I've been shopping around and returning a few laptop sleeves I would buy from stores because they would not fit my laptop. I do not like the laptop sleeves with the zippers because I'm afraid that the teeth would scratch into the body of my laptop when I slip it inside. This one has no zippers and it stretches so no worries about your laptop getting scratched. Color is great as well.
Invaluable for anyone who is designing or developing mobile solutions, especially those using the 3G infrastructure that is currently being rolled out in the US by two major carriers.Strong points: discusses mobile networking within the context of GPRS and 3G, making the information up to date. The detailed discussion of IP version 4 upon which the internet is based (and its many limitations), and IP version 6, which has enough address space to assign 4 IP address to each square inch of this planet's surface, is excellent. I like the comparisons and contrasts, and the discussion of barriers to implementing IP version 6.This is a book with a narrow look. Because it is narrow it goes deeply into the necessary details and is essential if you are involved with designing or deploying mobile IP.
Except for one or two cuts, Ink left me cold. So, when I returned to this one I was wondering if I had mis-gauged The Fixx entirely. But, no.While not up to the heights of Walkabout (what on Earth is?), Calm Animals delivers. In spades. From an inauspicious beginning (I'm Life, which sounds like a bad Fixx imitation with a wacky waltz section) each cut thereafter raises the stakes until you just don't think they can keep it up. But incredibly they do.Heavily guitar-oriented, some of the cuts out-U2 U2, especially Precious Stone. A number, like Gypsy Feet and The Flow, recall the atmospherix of Walkabout. Grab it. It's out there cheap. You can thank me later.
The first reviewer has Ms. Price's debut with the Met listed as in 1962. However, she premiered in "Il Trovatore" in January, 1961, with Franco Corelli at the Met. Secondly, Ms. Price, as she aged, became a much more intelligent singer.Chest voice does not belong in Opera. I make that statement knowing full well that there are esteemed voice teachers as well as students and professionals who disagree with me. Some famous singers claim that the chest voice is an important part of the voice. I disagree completely. Realize that this was Maria Callas' undoing. She tried to sing everything and "overacted" opera roles because she continued to lose her head voice through her very short-lived career. Maria Callas is only one example. I could list any number of singers who have not lasted long enough because of their inability to sing correctly.True bel canto requires that the singer have a fluidity in using the head voice as well as a solid working knowledge of the head voice -- a lifetime's achievement. It is for this reason that Ms. Price is perhaps the most intelligent singer I have ever encountered. She "knows" how to sing, and does it beautifully. We should all be thankful for having had the opportunity of experiencing this supeerlative artist. She has even spoken of head voice to students in Master classes when their voices failed after having sung only two arias. I am a high school vocal teacher. I recently played two short arias for my students (indeed a dangerous undertaking) sung by Miss Price, and asked for their responses to her. I was quite surprised -- they understood what the sound of the head voice was and one student observed, "Why would anyone want to sing in their chest voice if they mastered the ability to sing this way?"This "Tosca" is a very intelligent reading of the part. Ms. Price "swoops" as the other writer puts it, to stay in her head voice rather than go into her chest voice. She is that intelligent. The chest voice is used in Broadway singing and in popular repertoire and I hope that theie are people out there who know the difference. Even now, we have Renee Fleming, who knows a good bit about bel canto, but she will will mention chest voice and sometimes I will hear a vowel that is incorrectly pronounced which will give us a heavy chest sound.Argue with me as much as you want. We are losing something precious, and when I hear someone talk of chest voice when referring to operatic singing or bel canto, well, I bristle and say that this person is misinformed and, what's worse. dangerous. Especially if it is a voice teacher. The great Birgit Nilsson mentioned how many bad voice teachers she was glad to have gotten rid of before she got a good one.Please listen to Ms. Price with great respect. I love her. I learned to love opera because of her. Get hold of as many of her albums as possible. The Verdi Heroines album is unparalleled. Get hold of this "Tosca" as well.One thing I don't understand. Why is it that when February rolls around every year, we hear of many great Black Americans during Black History month, and yet we do not hear of Ms. Price at all? History tells us that she was the FIRST Black American to ever sing on the Metropolitan stage. What gives?
I am a big fan of David Weber's books but this one is just not worth reading. Extremely wordy with lots of irrelevant points, you really have to be tough to slog through this brick. Might have been a good read if it was about 600 pages shorter.Take my advice, give it a miss and go read some Jack Vance. Now there is a man who can pack a story in!
I recently re-watched the Androids of Tara for the first time in several years and I found out just why it had been collected dust in the back of my video collection for so long. Simply put, Androids of Tara just isn't that great a story.It's arguably the weakest of the Key to Time season (Power of Kroll gives it a run for the money in that department), simply because it's too predictable. The search for the Key to Time occupies only the first few moments of episode one and the final moemnts of episode four. It's a book end story designed to get us into the main story--that of Count Grendel and his mechanizations to take power on the planet of Tara. Before you can say &quot;double double&quot; there are androids on top of androids, dopplegangers and the Doctor and Romana embroiled in local politics. The story has potential--but most of it's wasted halfway through. The serial never gels and it feels as though the creative team and the production team were wearying of the entire Key to Time concept by this story.So, if you're a Who completist, check this one out. If you're new to Who and want to see some great Who, look for &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; or &quot;Pyramids of Mars&quot; as examples of how good the fourth Doctor's era can be.
Draw a bath and grab a razor blade - it's the bleakest film ever made! Babe travels to the city and learns that the world is a great big dark pit of despair and suffering.Cringe! in slack-jawed horror as animals and cancer-stricken children flee a hospital fire.Weep! as a depressive orangutan tries in vain to maintain his dignity in a world that strips all dignity away.Sob inconsolably! as innocent animals tell (with children's voices) tales of the unspeakable cruelties they have suffered at the hands of Man.Finally, fall! to your wretched knees and pray desperately in the implacable face of an uncaring universe for some small sign that life is more than an endless black night of pain and despair that makes a mockery of hope and a cruel joke of the conceit that there is any kindness or joy to be found in the barren desolation of this cold and merciless world.
Well, i tell u 1 thing. Petty kills at SoundStage. The dvd is great, & at a good time in the band's life together, and Lord knows, they've been together for a long time. The show is well made, and the colors & sound are top quality. Recommended video, fur sure.
This is an adorable and entertaining book! I did it as a read-aloud to my first grade class and they immediately asked me to read it again. Prior to reading, I asked them if they knew what Pirates said, and they all growled, "ARGH!" which was the perfect lead-in to this story..."R" said the pirate. "R's not enough! We need more letters to make us sound tough!" So the pirates go off in search of the entire alphabet. The pictures and rhyming text make it a very enjoyable story.
I got this because it was the least expensive, decent looking bluetooth headset available. One really big thing in its favor is that, in comparison to other bluetooth headsets, the 330 is pretty discreet. Okay, I admit, it flashes blue every once and a while and people look at you funny. But it is by far one of the least obnoxious and lowest-impact earpieces in terms of appearance. For me, that is a good thing. You may desire a different, more bling bling look. Another good thing is the price.However, the price seems to show in the quality of the earphone. The microphone appears to work fine- no complaints from people that I could not hear them clearly. But in my experience, this headset has been very variable in regard to how clearly I can hear the other person. The fidelity seems variable and I can't explain why. At this price, I really would not hesitate to buy it, though. I got it when it cost a little more and I do not regret buying it. I do not doubt that there are better bluetooth headsets out there, but I do not think that for thirty bucks this is a waste of money. If I'd paid $150 for it, I would say that the fidelity of the earphone is not up to par for an item of that price, but that's not the case.
I was only going to watch 5 minutes of this DVD, and dedicate more time for it later, but as it turned out, I could NOT stop watching. I wound up watching the whole thing. The &quot;actors&quot; are actual students from Shaolin. Wheel of Life is the Chinese equivalent of the Irish &quot;Riverdance.&quot; The story is about a group of monks from Shaolin who help the Chinese king defeat barbarians, only later to be betrayed by him for their unwillingness to stay as imperial guards. All the performance is done on the stage, and it was filmed rather well. Sometimes you view from the audiences' perspective, sometimes you get an extreme close-up. The performance was stunning. The acrobatic and gymastic skills of the actors just made my jaw drop. I found it very similar to watching a Cirque du Soleil show, more than anything. If you're a serious kung-fu afficionado like the reviewer below, you'll be disappointed, but for the general public, I believe you'll find this DVD highly entertaining, and probably view again and again.
I am not going to write a whole essay for this movie all i have to say is check this one out a rare and strange christopher lee film. for collectors only of classic sixties and seventies films.the plot is a little diffcult to explain but this movie is good.
Oh my goodness, what a preposterous movie this is. A hybrid comedy-horror flick, it fails miserably on both levels.The only saving grace are appearances by George Zucco and Bela Lugosi, who though placed into silly roles, still somehow manage to bring some of their unique talents to the screen. I think they are both exceptional personalities and am saddened so see them involved in this ridiculous drivel.The other characters are borderline obnoxious, especially the buffoon bodyguard, the pugnacious reporter, his dingbat fiancee, the bizarre maid, and yes even the murdered corpse. Only the husband/son comes off as anything close to a regular character. And who knows what role the dwarf plays in the twisted plot - the script writer sure didn't!I just can't come to grips with what a bizarre film this is. If there's anything to describe a lower budget than "low budget", this is it. I can see this motion picture serving as inspiration for the infamous Ed Wood. The killer could have easily been a character out of Wood's 'Glen or Glenda'. Sadly, Lugosi would soon fall under the spell of Wood for several of the worst motion pictures ever made.Entertaining in an egregious way, I'd have to give this one a single star, but Zucco and Lugosi's presence brings it up a notch to two stars. And that's being generous!
I'm not sure what I liked more, the book or the negative reviews. Having spent the last 5 years of my life in undergrad philosophy, Life of Pi didn't offer any new philosophical insights. For those who grasped the point made in the end, it's a rather old argument, but presented in a very colourful story that at first I wasn't able to get into, but then became quite enthralled with.I can't help but wonder if the people who didn't &quot;get it&quot; were distracted when reading. I notice a number of reviews saying the beginning has nothing to do with the middle or end. Not to be vague and blunt, but the beginning is the beginning that leads to the middle and the end. In order to find the significance in the story, simply pay attention to who and what Pi is during his time in India. His devotion to religion and family, the influences of his two friends Kumar and what each represents and the small bits of information into the character of animals and humans.Did the book make me believe in God? Well, no, that would be sort of silly. As someone very non-religious I doubt any book could do that. But I understood its message clearly enough and I even agree with the principle. Especially as its presented in this work, its very moving, something I'm not apt to say often.For the life of me I can't figure the reviews from people who say it has no ending, I'm not sure what more they hoped for, what the thought lacking. I read the ending no less than 6 hours ago, it was clear to me and very appropriate as well. Again, I suspect perhaps some readers were just too distracted or were reading in such a way as to focus only on the hapter at hand without appreciating the whole story as it had been built to that point.In any event, I'd certainly recommend the book. It draws on in some places but more than makes up for it on the whole.
All tracks in this album give the impression of an indifferent pianist banging away on the keyboard. Bronfman's attempts--already hesitant--at lyricism, subtlety, and introspection are unconvincing. Should Brahms really be played this way? I have the Murray Perahia recording (Sony Classical) of Brahms's Quartet for Piano and Strings in g minor (with the Amadeus Quartet), his rhapsodies, intermezzo, and capriccio. Nothing there suggests a pianist hesitant to take on the composer's definite romanticism. Perhaps Bronfman has no real enthusiasm for Brahms's music. Stay away. Other pianists do Brahms better.
As another reviewer had put it best: "it is just too much fun"If you love the music, and not afraid of some non-traditional winks you are in for a real treat... what else can I say ... I truly wish I could watch it live...
my son got this as a gift for his first birthday. He's great at wearing hats and didn't mind wearing it. I was afraid it might not fit, he's a big boy with a big head.. but it did, you can stretch it a little.Everyone at his party (the adults) thought it was great. Got cake all over it, but we'll need a bigger one for next year anyway!
Five long years passed between Samael's previous album Eternal and Reign of Light. During that time disaffected fans of the band's early albums who didn't like the introduction of electronic sounds called out loudly across message boards, radio shows, and magazines for a return to their undeveloped death metal beginnings. Any fears that Samael might actually cave in to the mindless hordes demanding they return to their immature roots from the days of yore, when black metal was all about burning churches and putting down Christianity, turned out to be completely unfounded. Thankfully, not only did they ignore these base requests, they actually continued to evolve their sound to an even higher level. This album is simply amazing. Samael has managed to keep their Satanic themes evident, without resorting to Christian bashing or teen angst style raging. The lyrics are actually uplifting for once, focusing on what mankind as a whole, and each individual person, can achieve when they don't put limits or constraints on themselves.The sound of the album has progressed significantly since Eternal. Everything sounds much cleaner, each instrument can be heard distinctly, and the vocals mesh perfectly. Front man Vorph's style of vocals has changed quite a bit since the older albums. The Passage era vocals were a near perfect low death growl that could actually be partially understood without cracking open the lyrics. The vocals on Reign of Light are even clearer, with only a slight reduction in aggressiveness. It's not quite as "in your face" as it used to be, but it's still very much recognizable as black metal.The first track starts out with a strange drum beat reminiscent of the bongos, with some eastern style guitar chords in the background hearkening back to the more experimental song Jupiterian Vibe from the Passage album. Vorph then belts out a piercing growl, letting everyone know they are still firmly in metal territory. Reign of Light has a much more heavy emphasis overall on electronica and techno style sounds here than in previous releases, which meshes very well with Samael's particular breed of metal. The song "Telepath" is definitely the highlight of the album, and the CD even comes with a bonus music video and a remix for it. Telepath manages the near impossible by being simultaneously furiously aggressive and catchy. The track "As the Sun" is a close runner up to Telepath with its groove oriented beat that conjures images of dancing with glow sticks and strobe lights.Reign of Light is a triumph for black metal, as it shows that metal bands can effectively evolve in new directions and still stay true to their core ideals. In a genre characterized by stagnation and repetition, Samael is a serious breath of fresh air.
This is the first Patricia Barber CD I have bought as I could not stand all the others. I find it very classy. Thank God for the standards as it gives me a chance to finally appreciate her voice. Perhaps now I can go &amp; investigate all the other releases.
Weight Watchers point that is. The bag is one point. A great, healthy snack to incorporate into your WW diet, or any other healthy lifestyle.I haven't had a problem with crumbs and powder in the packets I've tried, no more than any other dried fruit I'd buy from Trader Joes or the Gerber ones. It's definitely a small bag for the price, so if you're near a Trader Joes, you should really buy their dried fruits.Amazon does have a great price for this item though... I paid $1.79 for one packet at a major chain!! That's insanity.
It's not a high end product, so my expectations aren't high. I bought this unit intending to use it for a wireless access point on my wired network at home.It meets that need very well. Fast, easy to set up for a passive access point, and no problems with 128 bit encryption.I do notice that it gets a little hot with use, so I stood it upright in the stand that came with it, and it seems to run cooler that way. I wonder if that's the root of some of the service problems people are seeing.I'll see what kind of service it gives over the long term, since it will get intermittent use when the kids are home from school with their wireless notebooks.
Diary of an unfulfilled pop star or sympathy card to his generation? Does it matter? Bowie's 23rd album spares us another round of trend-hopping, opting for a more believable adult-contemporary groove, but his pathological ironic detachment makes him hard to take seriously as Love's Survivor. Even so, this album didn't have to be so weak -- the emotional heft in Bowie's songs has never come from him but his guitarists, from Mick Ronson to Stevie Ray Vaughan. A pity that Reeves Gabrels is such a cipher. His latest collaboration with Bowie is typically stagnant; bloodless guitars and synths substitute half-baked "moods" for genuine emotions. As for lyrics, take your pick from obtuse, half-finished or banal. "Sometimes I cry my heart to sleep ... Sometimes my courage fell to my feet," the auteur laments in "Thursday's Child." That would be drippy even if it didn't come from a billionaire married to a supermodel.
This is something that every shade tree mechanic should have. Sure you might only use it once or twice every few years, but checking compression on a non running engine is one of the first few steps. Believe me, I had a triumph engine that I did everything too, but check the compression. Should have been the first thing I checked with a unknown non starting engine, had really bad compression.Build is nice! I got it because of the metal hose, but now I think I may have gone rubber ( the metal may scratch your valve cover it the spark plugs are down deep). Like the brass fittings, I have heard of the attachments on other sets coming off and getting stuck in the head, that would be bad. Well, this unit no problems like that. Get a set, because it comes with different size fittings and then you don't have to buy different sizes fittings later.I used it on a 2004 Triumph Daytona 600.
in the year 2000, i did study abroad for the first time, and in an effort to pack lightly, i took only one small cd case worth of discs with me. the crown jewels of the collection were jeff buckley's grace, kate bush's the dreaming, carl orff's carmina burana, and PoE's hello. i listened to them constantly, especially on the bus when we took day-trips. (i did add french purchases, as well...most notably teri moise)when the weekend of the Annunciation came up, two friends and i decided to take the long weekend in Amsterdam. on the train, tommy (one of the two--kelly being the other) was curious about my music. first, he gave kate bush a whack, and then PoE. he was enrapt with both women, but especially so with PoE--duh, huh?all through the trip, he held on to the disc, and i had a hard time getting it back from him. when on the way home from the Dam i told him i would make a gift of the disc (at the end of the summer, on the plane goin' home), he was elated!!! (who wouldn't be?)the next overnight we had was as a class: Carcassonne!!! (an amazing walled medieval city, in the south of france--beautiful, and cool-cool-cool!!!) we stayed in the auberge, in the center of the old city. the inn-keepers do not monitor the boy/girl arrangements (nor do they care), and all of us were at least 18, so tommy roomed with us--a group of chicas. sometime, over the course of the long weekend, PoE disappeared. tommy admitted he had "borrowed" her, and as we were all going to the same place(s), i did not worry--especially because i had decided to give her to him in a couple of weeks, anyway.long story short, i never saw that disc again. THAT IS HOW MUCH PoE ROCKS!!!p.s. when in 2001 i met PoE at a record shop in the Woodlands, TX (north of Houston), and i told her the story, she was sooo sweet!!! she signed my stuff: "thanks for taking me to Europe!!!" who wouldn't love her after that?p.p.s. MZD was there with her, and i got to meet him as well. super neat guy!!!
Ok maybe because i was forced by my english teacher to read this book, it shafted my view, but this is seriously the most awful book i have ever read. Melinda is a depressed freshman, and doesnt know how to deal with it. she thinks about suicide and constantally dis's other people at her school. Yes she did get raped, but other people have gotten raped and delt with it in other ways than that. Basically my whole class thought that this book was terriable. It was written well, but after the first half you knew what was going to happen. The only thing that i did not understand is how no one noticed anything. I mean she cut her self and constantally skipped shcool and didnot talk. This is where her parents, classmates, etc should have noticed something. Yes they did hater her, but her "best friend" should have notice something and so should have ehr teachers. This book sucked and was unrealistic.
The other reviews covered most of my reactions to this wonderful book, but I have a few things to add.One is on the nature of being an orphan: as traumatizing as it was for Danny to lose his parents [such as feeling his other relatives would disappear as well], he was better off than his cousin Matt, whose father was only sort of there & wasn't a good father at all.I also thought who I might have ended up living with had I become orphaned at that age. My parents' families were spread out over hundreds of miles & even those who lived in the same city lived far enough away that I wouldn't have still gone to the same school. Any child facing that would have a much worse time.
This movie is horrible. Everything that was wonderful about the cartoon fell apart in the hands of Director Shyamalan. Although the special effects were good, they couldn't save the movie. The acting was horrible, and the terrible script didn't help. They made Aang completely serious and devoid of joy or a personality for that matter. This movie is not one of those "It's so bad it's good" movies. But, if you DO still want to see it because you wonder how it could possibly be as awful as everyone says it is (a mistake I made)then at least rent it from Redbox and save yourself a dollar. Believe me, the less money you spend on this movie the less guilt you'll have after watching it.
Good little metal chain with 5000 lb break strength. My use of it is to tie my winch to a object. The working load of the chain (1200 ib) is same as my winch. I have not used it in harsh condition yet.
Gives a good general landscape - adequate for getting to ski/hiking/recreational spots. Would be inadequate for detailed salt lake city map.
As a Country Blues fan, I can't say that I'm the biggest Deep Purple fan in the world. However, I highly enjoy many Classic Rock acts, such as Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Deep Purple. This show finds them in excellent form. Ritchie's guitar playing is fantastic, Paice's drumming is frantic, Coverdale and Hughes both sing their hearts out, but, to me, the real star of the show is Lord, whose organ work is simply breathtaking. I bought this dvd at a subway station store in MyeongDong, Seoul, South Korea today, for three dollars, and am quite pleased with my purchase. This dvd is strongly recommended to anybody who enjoys '70s Classic Rock and great electric guitar work. It's easy to see how Ritchie inspired a certain '80s guitar playing "hero" who has an amazing amount of talent but can't write a good song to save his life!
A great way to let your child think they are getting TV time while helping with their learning. I use this as a compliment to reading books and one on one learning of the alphabet. I am sure there are other similar options out there so I can't say this is the best there is, as I have not experienced the others, but this DVD keeps my nearly two year olds attention by regularly changning pictures, music and presentation throughout the DVD. It works for us.
I can't believe what I'm reading from the other reviewers. I respect all kind of opinions, but I must completely disagreeDecoteau seems to have loose completely the knack of how to do homoerotic films. The man actually thinks that he is doing something like real cinema! This film (?) hasn't even a decent makeout sequence. The only two very short ones are intermixed between two same sex couples. Even the wrestling scene (the only worth watching thorought the whole film) it's ruined being continuously interrupted by the awful sight of that amount of cheek botox woman who plays the lead role showing her boobs. Well, "played" maybe was a major word for what she does. Who were you thinking that will feel arouse with that, gay men.. lesbians... misguided heteros or maybe bisexuals? In my opinion, it's awful for everyone. So bad as the completely and utterly preposterous script (if can be called that way)I use to enjoy the David Decoteau's films back then when he was working for heterosexual studios like Full Moon, etc. His films were a LOT more homoerotic then, some were equally boring but others were a total guilty pleasure and really fun to watch. Now that he can finally work with a LGBT channel his cinema has become more and more prude and auto-restrained than before.If poor Edgar Allan Poe's could see his name associated with so many bad adaptations! Or the wonderful Vincent Price! In the old times, Roger Corman and American International were working with almost the same low budget as Rapid Heart does but nonetheless they were producing ART. This is not even fun or erotic.Anyway... I must say something positive about this new "Pit and the Pendulum" Meanwhile "The Brotherhood V Alumni" feels like a 4 hours film, this has improved and feels like 3 and a half more or less. The thing is that both of them run 85' more or less!Go more to cinema, watch cable television and evolve a little, Mr. Decoteau. Nowadays, homoeriticsm in the media goes further than showing cute guys in underwear walking like zombies. As you can check on shows like "Spartacus, Blood and sand" Or at least revisit your own videography, you'll be surprised by your own old material!Even from a film like "The Covenant" totally inspired by your erotic style, you would learn a thing or two.I am looking forward (or better said trembling) for watching "The Brotherhood VI Initiation" and "The Invisible Chronicles" By the way... the two would use the same house again...? LOL!
This book is basically pretty (bad). No other words to say it but it's(bad). The things described in this book I asure will not work. It shows pictures of a ninja getting passed a military guard over and over with different tactics which i believe is complete (nonsense) and if you try to sneak in any military camp with these skills you won't be alive very long. If you do happen to get by the guards like the ninja photographed in the book then the guard and his army are (not very competent) and most likely won't achieve what there trying to achieve. I must say that maybe there are ninja secrets of invisibility but you just won't find them in this book. If your into ninja i recommend reading books by Stephen K. Hayes and Masaaki Hatsumi.
This is a 45 minute tape, it's meant to be aimed at beginner level yogis, I am not beginner level - have the level 3 Body and Soul which is vinyasa flow - quite tough and sweat inducing and can handle it pretty wel. This is a different mood. It is a nice flow of yoga poses, most of which are very stretchy, you do move in flows from cat to down dog quite a lot which warms you nicely but it is definitely a deep stretch session, not a workout. Just what I wanted for certain days. Lots of upper body stretches and nice hip openers, felt great afterwards - the 1instructor is excellent and gives great cues. Highly recommended
There's an entire series of Indiana Jones titles that sprang up to fill the void between "Last Crusade" and 2007's as-yet-untitled Indy 4.Rob McGregor is the principle author of most of these stories (other titles were written by noted Sci-Fi author Martin Caidin and Max McCoy.) Rob's entr&eacute;e to the series was when he wrote the novelization for "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade."Rob's writing strives mightily to capture the feel and, not as successfully, the scientific thinking of the era. While Rob's characterizations of Indiana Jones faithfully follows the movie persona, his reliance on overly complicated scripts sometimes distracts the reader. Another irritant is his reliance on the miraculous (and, so far, consistent) sudden appearance of a new character, Jack Shannon, to rescue Indy from whatever predicament he's landed himself in.However, the formula is by it's very nature limiting and McGregor works as well in it as can be expected. For the True Believers in the Indy mythos, this series performs yeoman-like work in a field bereft of competitors.At least until Indy 4 - of course!
Eve Golden is a writer who knows Hollywood, especially classic Hollywood in the 1910s, 1920s and 1930s. For anyone who read Moveline magazine back in it's heyday, Eve Golden wrote witty video reviews along with other contributions.Golden turns her attention to Jean Harlow and the result is stunning. The tragic, short life of the wisecracking blonde from the Mid-West is told without being too sugar-sweet and refrains from wallowing in gutter like a cetain 1960s biography of Harlow. Jean Harlow was a nice person with a longing to be more than just the blonde bombshell the public saw, not a nymphomaniac who needed a navy fleet and an ocean of booze to get through the night.The layout of the book and the photographs are amazing. Reading this in hardcover is knowing you're reading some very special beyonf the usual as-told-to film/tv/ star tat that crowds the Biography sections.For the film buff or newbie that wants a worthwhile read that's not hard on the eyes, "Platinum Girl" is a clear winner.
"lovehatetragedy" is finally out now and I must say that it is an interesting progression from "Infest". For one thing, Coby Dick is now going by his real name, Jacoby Shaddix...and there is a lot more singing going on this time around. By now you have probably heard the first single "She Loves Me Not" on the radio, and this is your typical P-Roach tune, which I just love the chorus, and overall a very fine track. The rest of the album is fairly good, although it lacks the ferocious energy "Infest" had, in my opinion. Thats my reasoning behind the 4-star rating. "Decompression Period" really shows a softer side to P-Roach, as does "Black Clouds". However, the album does take a few listens though to really appreciate it...but I feel that this is not a sophomore slump in any way.
I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS OF MR. BAZAN AND MR. HARRIS.ALL I CAN ADD IS THAT FOR LESS THAN $20.00,YOU WILL BE THE PROUDOWNER OF ONE OF THE BEST DRAMAS CURRENTLY ON TV.IF YOU ARE IMPRESSED BY EXCELLENT WRITING, SUBER ACTING,AND GRITTY REALISM, PURCHASING THIS SET IS A "NO-BRAINER."SHOWTIME HAS REALLY RAISED THE BAR ON QUALITY BY PRESENTINGTHIS WORK OF ART.I HAVE NOT BEEN THIS IMPRESSED BY THE FIRST SEASON OF A SERIES, SINCE "SIX-FEET UNDER". HIGH PRAISE INDEED, BUT IT'S TRUE.MOVE OVER "RESCUE ME", "THE SHIELD", AND "THE WIRE"; YOU'VEJUST BEEN JOINED AT THE BAR BY "BROTHERHOOD."
The color was better than expected and the weight of the material draped beautifully. Very, very pleased with this purchase.
First things first. Yes, this movie is as good as you've heard. It does deserve every award it has received. It does not, however, leave you uplifted and happy.... or does it? Yes, it has a somewhat ambivalent message, and I think revels in the fact that it is somewhat ambivalent. Kevin Spacey's character dies, but dies happy and actually smiling. He gets his wish, in terms of one of his daughter's friend, and then realizes that he can't take the opportunity.And so on and so on.....If you haven't seen it, see it. If you saw it a long time ago, see it again.
Bands that have been around for several years and several albums usually have three choices. 1st, they can keep putting out basically the same album over and over like Korn. 2nd, they can completely change and go in a different musical direction like Radiohead or Wilco. 3rd, they can subtly evolve, widening their palate while keeping essentially the same sound. Spoon falls firmly in to the third category.Ga X5 continues Spoon's run of consistent and very good albums. All of the typical Spoon elements are here, foot stomping rhythms, fuzzy guitar lines, literate lyrics, heavy low end basslines, and rambling piano parts. On Ga X5 Spoon has expanded their palate to include more blatant pop influences and some spacey dub rhythms.You Got Yr. Cherrybomb is the best example of the pop on this album. This is the first time I've heard Spoon go full on blue eyed soul with a horn section. It reminds me of Billy Joel, which in this case is a good thing. The Jon Brion produced The Underdog is also pure pop. They bring out the horns for this one too with great results. The song's as catchy as anything they've ever done.The dub influences come through in the middle section of the album. Don't You Evah, and Eddie's Ragga all feature thumping and thick basslines, and some spacey tape effects and reverb. Both songs are very good, even if Eddie's Ragga meanders a little bit.Ga X5 is a lean mean 10 songs and 36 minutes with hardly a wasted moment on the whole album. The only weak song is The Ghost of You Lingers. Spoon has built whole songs on tape loops and effects before like Paper Tiger, but where a Paper Tiger sound eerie and atmospheric, The Ghost of You Lingers just seems pointless.Other than that, Ga X5 is another solid collection of songs and a great addition to the Spoon catalogue. Spoon always puts out very good albums that are usually top 10 of the year worthy, but never an album of the year. They've got a very sturdy formula and they keep finding new ways to expand and keep things interesting.
... until you've read "Queen Lucia" (the preceding book in the series) first. You have to know the characters better to get the full meat of the jokes.
In a perfect companion piece toMarie Antoinette: The JourneyDeborah Cadbury fully captures the agony, terror and despair felt by the French royal family in their final times before their demise. It's not something to read if you don't want to be captured by the emotions yourself; parts of the book were definitely tear-jerking. I had always wondered what had happened to the 16th Louis and was never satisfied by the few paragraphs on Wikipedia, but this book finally put my curiosity to rest. This book seems to be painstakingly researched and written with much devotion and care.4 stars rather than 5 because the story about the dauphin himself doesn't really start until like halfway through the book (though for people not familiar with the Marie Antoinette story, the 1st part of the book is definitely an important piece.) So, to be fair, let's say 4 1/2.
All three of these books are wonderful! It is so sweet, this story! I would definitly want to read it again! I usually go for the spicy rather than the sweet romance novels but I find myself willing to pick up a Candace Camp book anyday and enjoy it. She is too good to pass up!
If you baked your cookies from scratch, or used the recipes in this book using regrigerated dough - nobody will know! You'll know though, because you'll have less mess and more free time.I used to love baking everything from scratch, and I still do from time to time (seems like twice a year now - Christmas and Easter). But when you become a Mom, although you're intentions were there, baking from scratch is often something there is just not time for anymore. This book gets you bake sale ready cookies that will win you raves as well as raise funds, office coffee room cookies that will be gone within minutes and gourmet cookies that your friends and family will want the recipes for. People will be whispering behind your back that you're the next Mrs. Fields.Using the refrigerated dough is also less ingredients for the baker on the go - just grab a few rolls and you're halfway there. Stock up on the mix ins, and you're done!Highly recommend!
This is the second of three volumes of Imperial biographies composed under mysterious circumstances by some mysterious personage(s). This volume covers the descendants of Severus - the feuding brothers Caracalla and Geta, Elagabalus, the High Priest of the Sun from Syria, his cousin Alexander - these are the most interesting biographies in the book. Worth reading just for the twin set of bios by &quot;Aelius Lampridius,&quot; who goes on at great length about the crimes of Heliogabalus, then glorifies his cousin Alexander who succeeded him. Both rulers were apparently ruled by their mothers. Readers are advised to take these screeds with a grain of salt, as they are prone to error and outright falsity. One could turn the task of sifting the true from the false in these biographies into a life's work (some already have). The Augustan History was an important source book for Edward Gibbon and continues to be of value, despite its demerits. I give it 5 stars for those reasons; really such sloppy, misleading work deserves 1 or no stars, but time and fortune have raised this work to prominence.
I have other hi tech testers that can be fooled by a fully charges battery that has 75% of its life left. The A500 is right on the mark with such batteries. Easy to use and nicely made. A little on the expensive side though. On the down side I left a ? in their support area After 10 days never heard. Also bought the printer - all work very well.
This is the sequel to A child Called it. I ran right out and bought it after finishing the first one. Picking up where &quot;it&quot; leaves off, here we follow the story of David from when he enters the foster care system though adolesence. His life doesn't get much easier as he moves from foster home to foster home, untrusting of affection and only having his feelings reinforced by what he learns in &quot;the system&quot;. I didn't find this one as well written as &quot;it&quot;, but that was quite a lot to live up to. Still, it is a moving story and one that you won't be able to put down.
Works great for the lawn mower and for the leaf blower. The price was good and the quality is too.
I enjoyed this watch so much that I bought a second one when the first one gave out. I like that I can check the time in the dark by pushing a button. my first one took alot of abuse so why would I change. I love this watch.
This book isn't about the Little Big Horn battle. It's primarily about a half-blood Indian named John Frost who lives with the Crows then goes to Carlisle Indian school. Here he is indoctrinated into Christianity. When he returns to the Crows, he finds that it is a big struggle to keep from returning to his old ways, you know, since Jesus wouldn't approve. You get the point. I'm about 3/4 of the way through the book but wanted to save future readers from making the same mistake I did, unless, of course, you agree with the premise outlined above.
I couldn't make any sense out of this pretentious piece of art house crap. Maybe you can, but I doubt it.I am a reasonably intelligent person, so if I don't "get it," the problem isn't with me. Don't waste your time.
I personally found the book slow and dull. It could not keep me interested and that is unusual since I can normally read just about any book that is put before me. There isn't much more I can really say about this book.
I could not put this one down. Priya has been living in the US for 7 years and is engaged to a non-Indian American. She flys to India to break the news to her family who she fears will disown her for not marrying an Indian boy of &quot;thier&quot; chose. Watch the fireworks fly when her family finally learns the news. Great story,don't miss it.
Man, this was one, long tedious movie. You've probably read all the other criticsms, and I agree with them. I gave it two stars instead of one because (1) it had the semblance of a plot, and (2) I was surprised toward the end as to who the bad guy was. I also liked the "heck with physics" part:POSSIBLE SPOILER! POSSIBLE SPOILER!You're after a guy who is trying to escape by plane. You get there, and he's gone: somehow he got by you and was headed back from whence you came. Reminds me of an MST-3K laugher (Wild Rebels), when the cops set up a roadblock but somehow forgot about one of the roads (easily seen by anyone). How did that guy get past them?OK, I'm going to mention the nudity part. What in the heck did that add to the plot? Why is it this young lady straps on a gun but would rather run from someone than use it? Does she have no hand-to-hand combat training? And the whining...
Awesome voice, awesome words. You will feel angels around you as you listen to the songs. I listen to mine over and over every day, go to sleep to it every night, and have bought more as gifts. Thank you Kirk! Keep up the Lord's work by sharing your wonderful gifts for many years to come.
This one does not work well. I thought that it would just allow more pulp into the juice, but it actually somehow causes the juicer to extract less juice and produce very wet pulp that will need to be manually pressed to extract juice.
got this out of the bargain bin...should have left it there.It has an extremely short running time, which is a good thing, considering how boring and uncatchy the arrangements are.nothing for your money
What a gem. This book is packed with everything the author deems necessary for ensuring you have an action-packed SP. He uses small chapters that are easy to follow and provides lots of examples from films and fragments from actual scripts (his own as well as others). This is not a how-to, more a what-others-do-that works. Actually, even if you're not a writer, this book is a great read for an insight into what analytically makes an action-flic.
I heard this album first when I was 8 years old in 1974. My older brother bought it and I thought it was the most unique thing I ever heard. I consider myself a music afficionado and love rock n roll, the Beatles. I am a huge fan of Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Elvis, Pet Sounds, Dark Side of the Moon, Sgt. Peppers, Highway 61 Revisited among others.This is probably the Best album that I ever heard. The music is gorgeous, sweet and melancholic. I cannot understand why ELO's music continues to be underrated to this day. Jeff Lynne may have more of a gift for melody than either Paul McCartney and Brian Wilson combined.The best song arguably is Eldorado. Lynne contributes quasi-operatic vocals to this work and Laredo Tornado that remind me of Roy Orbison who he later worked with in the Traveling Wilburys. All of the other songs are classic as well. Poor Boy with it's medieval tones. Boy Blue, the western theme of Laredo Tornado, the melancholic Mr. Kingdom, the Bernstein meets the Stones Rocker, Illusions in G Major, the lusty musings of Nobody's Child, and most of all the dreamer, the unwoken fool of Can't Get It Out of my head and Eldorado. Eldorado, the city of Gold that Cortez searched for. Other forbidden paradises would later be referenced in Shangri-La (from A New World Record)and Xanadu(from the film and album of the same name). None would be quite as beautiful and, yes, as melancholic as Eldorado. This album w/o the bonus tracks is all of 37 minutes. God I wish it was twice as long. How sweet it is.Jeff, Sony, if you have anymore outtakes from these sessions, please release them in an Eldorado Ultimate Edition.Odd and as different is another ELO concept album, very underrated as well is Time. My second favorite ELO album and as totally different from Eldorado as night is to day. The Orchestra part is largely absent and the songs are very upbeat and propulsive in toneI wish the original band with Lynne, Bevan, Tandy, Kaminski and others (Groucutt and Roy Wood)would reform and make this kind of music again.One needs a dreamer and some really good music these days!
Those who read my reviews know that I judge a horror movie on the basis of my JUMP FACTOR. If you saw Part One you know what this is about, and if you didn't I am not going to spoil it. So, I'll break down my rating:New Ideas Since Part One: 1 --- Nothing really. It is a continuation of the original.Writing/Acting: 3 --- Not a lot of room for big action, but nuance acting was poor. Not much story/plot here. Typical.Speed at which movie gets going: 3 --- A little too much time on the initial "search" scene, after that, it's ON!Ability to draw audience into movie: 5 --- I felt like I was right there in the caves with them!Comic Interlude: 3 --- "Now I wish I was back in water.."Blood/Gore/Disgust: 5 --- Most definitely!Jump Factor: 5 --- I knew what to expect, even so, some scenes made me jump!Sex Appeal (Ms. Mendoza Only): 5 --- Splunkin'!Action Sequences: 5 --- Part One was great because of the fight scenes. This one carries that tradition!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Enjoy it with popcorn and an ice-cold Pepsi!
Poetry and prose come together in a journey of discovery to and from the e-land of TimBookTu.com. The selected writers in this work of an African American Poetic Odyssey have made the journey from aspiring to arriving literary voices.
While this film is sort of interesting, and has an art house cinematic visual appeal, it lacks the usual compelling plot progression that makes most Coen brothers' films so much fun. Thronton lives up (down?) to the title of his role, and James Gandolfini, Tony Shalhoub, and Jon Polito all briefly shine in their respective parts, but the apathy of Billy Bob's character seems to infect the whole process. Can't recommend it.
This unit is not worth the money. Unfortunately I gave this unit as a gift to my mom, helping her set this item up was a nightmare, the unit itself is gorgous, and the keys are beatifully back-lit, however the software included is a bit confusing, does not find addresses too well, and to top it off the unit is extremely extremely slow. the processor can not keep up with input selections as well as recalculations of routes, warm up time is deplorable and as other reviewers have noted, can take up to 2-3 minutes to find your position. I have used a Garmin c320 and this unit while more expensive, is far superior to this unit.All in all, even though the price of this unit is very very tempting, save your money and purchase something else. this unit is obsolete and can not handle normal day to day operations.
I ordered two of these at the same time, one for myself and one for my wife. Neither has been satisfactory, each for its own reasons.The multi-function button on the first one was difficult to push and required too much pressure on the in-ear speaker, making the headset uncomfortable to use. Any background noise rendered voice commands completely inoperable -- not that they worked well even in a quiet room. Finally, after about 6 weeks of light use, it simply quit working ... period!The second one seemed to have none of the problems of the first, but one evening I forgot to remove it when visiting a family member. I put it into my pocket, sat down to eat dinner, and when I got up the speaker had just snapped off.Think I'll try something different this time.
Fairly run-of-the-mill action plot...shooting, car chases, bad guy is good guy, or is he? This movie could have been less convoluted if the writing had been better. This is the kind of movie you watch and then ask yourself, Did I REALLY just pay $3.99 for that? Oh well....January is a bad month for new movie releases, so this B movie Straight-To-DVD was the best I could do. Having the head FBI guy rooting for the thief was kinda lame, which followed suit. I didn't feel any of the actors really were into this movie. The kid that is abducted is ugly and obnoxious. There was far too little character relationship development, especially between father and daughter. I guess they figure everyone knows how much a daughter means to a father --well---not for the sake of a movie. I need flashbacks of tender moments, bonding moments (like they used in TAKEN) so I know he really wants to save her, not just because she is his daughter, but because they have a real and meaningful relationship. With that missing, the movie was just bland.
This song has become a cult wherever the movie was a hit. These remixes take the original song of the movie to a dance club level, specially the Collaboration Remix that keeps the beauty of the original score lead by an electronic base line. The track is so inspiring and beautiful that will make you cry of happiness while you're dancing hypnotized by the strings chord line and the Trance/House beat. One of the best G anthems ever, better than "I Will Survive" We need more of this, please!!!
This may be the worst movie I've seen in the past 5 years (and I watch a lot of movies). I lived in the town where this "story" supposedly happened. Elkhorn Wisconsin. The movie has about as much to do with the real story as Shaquile O'Neil is like Pee Wee Herman. It's ridiculous. The story is non sense, the writting is horrible. The "writter" tries to borrow bits and pieces from Jaws liberally, lines, charactors, scenes and work it in to a werewolf story. It doesn't work. The charactors have a combined IQ of about 12. This isn't even Drive In worthy. My wife and I only watched it because it was based on a local legend. Back in the 1980's locals reported seeing a creature along the country roads, but no one ever actually was hurt or came face to face with it. Kind of like Big Foot sightings. Anyway, unless your a local looking for local references and mentions I can't imagine why anyone would want to spend an hour and a half watching this. It's pretty bad. The only reason I'm giving this 1 star is that you aren't allowed to give it Zero.
This is quite simply a dragged out dumb movie. I couldn't even stay with it long enough to see the end. After an hour of it, you simply don't care how it ends.
Ordered just before a long flight, really made a difference compared to the cheap earbuds I have been using. Comfortable fit and amazing audio quality. As others have noted, a low quality recording will sound worse. I noticed a big improvement with large WMA files compared to MP3's...you can actually hear the difference when listening with a computer,quality is a bit lower with a PDA. Definitely recommend.
I bought this for my cats, it works wonders! The cats did look a little skinnier without all that extra hair, but there was very little hair on my furniture after that. I would definitely recommend this product.
The book, besides being out of date, fell way short of expectations in its day. There is a relatively short section specific to the breed followed by the typical, formulaic, generic 'any' dog breed advice found in book series of this ilk. The health information was minimal and glossed over the health issues found in the breed.
I was looking forward to reading this book for quite some time before I bought it. The story and the history was excellent; the descriptions vivid. I could hardly put it down. But, Mr. Topping is a newspaper man, and his journalistic style sometimes came through in the dialog between characters, and often sounded like he was quoting an interviewee.All in all, it is a definite must have for any one with an interest in Chinese history and fiction.
Thanks to the reviewers who steered me to this one by pointing out its absence of plastic.I bought this after owning several others that either imparted a plastic taste to the coffee or had the plastic parts fail. It is attractive and easy to clean.For those reviewers who have cleanup issues, just line a strainer or colander with a paper towel, pour the wetted and sloshed grounds in and wait. When the water has subsided, throw away the grounds. I sometimes just use my rather large hand to hold the paper towel and squeeze the water out. Or form a cup with the paper towel in the sink drain.
Once you have read the 'Power of Now' three times, and you fully acknowledge and live by the principle of staying in the present, 'A New Earth' is your next step upward on the path to higher consciousness. This book is an easy to read masterpiece of spiritual literature for helping people awaken to a higher purpose in life. I personally liked 'A New Earth' more than 'The Power of Now', but they're both awesome books and required reading. However 'A New Earth' is more colorful and enriching. I dare say that if all of humanity embraced Eckhart Tolle's teachings, there would be less pain, war and suffering in this world.
This is Joseph's DAUGHTER.This album is great. Chris has a good voice for a 16 year old. (And for the person who said that Ralph Tresvant sounded like a young boy singing. Reality Check: He sounded like a GIRL. A good singing girl, but a girl nonetheless.)Anyway, the beat on the album are great and the songs are iresistably addicting. My favorites are:Just Fine (Fav song on the album)Winner (Second Fave)Gimme ThatRun ItYo (Excuse Me Miss)Ya Man Ain't MeIn conclusion, by the album. You'll love it. And Chris, I look forward to seeing what you in the future.
James Swanson pursues the tale of the 12 day manhunt for John Wilkes Booth and his accomplices over the course of about 400 pages and 11 chapters. The book is liberally supported with photos and reproductions of new articles and letters of the time, including a transcript of Booth's journal. Additionally, there is a wealth of references in the back.I was really impressed with this book's accessibility to readers. The narrative is compelling and the story addictive. There are a lot of "little details" that surface, ranging from real trivia to fascinating side topics, all of which are explored without detracting from the ongoing timeline. It's clear that the author spent a lot of time researching all of the players involved and took the time and care to present it in a way that would be interesting to read.As a history teacher I would strongly recommend this to other teachers as well as to students in the upper grades. I'd also recommend this to people interested in the Civil War, Lincoln, etc. In many ways, this is also a good book for the casual reader, being interesting and compelling without being too "dry"
If you like to understand how things work then this book is horrible in its explanations. Just a little bit of mathematics and some pseudocode for the procedures would have made some sense out of this attempt. For each area, find a good paperback to supplement your graduate travels through this text and you will be fine.
Kiss comes back with a revenge with this album. Gone are the times when the band tried to sound like Def Leppard and Bon Jovi. Even Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley abandoned their flashy and multicolored clothes, dress in black and wash their sins from their recent past with a very hard, loud and fast album. This is the real Kiss. This is how Kiss would have sounded if they had started their career in the nineties.For many reasons, this is probably the best album the band will ever release. First, they are not with their make up, which apart from being funny and classical, can have the effect of hiding the real value of their music. Only their talent is at stake. They come from an era of bad and pretty commercial albums, filled with the 80s pop sounds of &quot;hard&quot; rock. Their fans' faith is at the lowest point.Unholy, the first song, is a statement of power. This is the first album where Gene Simmons takes the lead voice in the opening theme and the result is a brutal, astonishing start. Even Paul Stanley sounds heavy. Bruce Kullik's lead guitar, which sometimes sounded exaggerated in previous (and later) albums, is perfect here.Even the most sincere of fans recognize that there is probably not a perfect Kiss album. There are always those fillers, and very frequently, B-sides are lazy... until this one. Revenge is the perfect Kiss album, with the sincerity of the seventies, but the freshness of ninieties. You cant miss this one.
I'm a fairly well versed programmer in some of the older style languages like C and C++. If you have some archaic C question, I may be your woman. I'm not so familiar with Java - in fact the last time I touched the language I could run to the local coffee shop, get a coffee, and get back to my program and it would just be starting up (back in the dark days, when java was really slow). Fast forward 12 years and not only is Java nimble and performant, but its something I need to know. Yesterday. Knowing this, I turned to the Head first series as they get their points across quickly and cleanly.Head First really does teach the topics so that you'll remember them. Most into programming books give you an example and you work through it. In Head First, yes there is an example, but the examinations happen via stories, diagrams, pictures, games and really good (bad) humor. What this means is that no matter how you learn, you'll find something that helps the concepts stick. Each chapter builds upon the last and each chapter reinforces lessons from before. You can tell that people who really know how to teach designed these books.Now this book is basic. I personally didn't mind reading about Objects and Object-Oriented design yet again. I also didn't mind reading about polymorphism, encapsulation, et al. The main reason for this is the presentation. Well that and there are a few subtle differences between C++ and Java that they talk about that I need to know. But mostly its the fun way they present the topics. I mean even if you know these topics cold, I still found some of their examples and comparisons well thought out and memorable. So much so in fact that I can see using them to help explain concepts to people I'll mentor or to marketing folks.If, however, you have programmed in Java before and are comfortable in the world of OO, and are looking for something to take you to the next step, I'd suggest you keep moving onto other books (Effective Java by Bloch is amazing). However, if you are new to Java, and even new to programming, you'll love the Head First books. The writing is clear and engaging (and correct!), the examples make sense, and way they tailor lessons to trigger different parts of your learning brain is really well done.
A wonderfully imagined look into the mind of a boy debilitated by cerebral palsy. The author, who himself has a son with cerebral palsy, imagines that Shawn, though confined to a wheelchair with absolutely no control over his own motor functions, is very smart, incredibly observant, and has perfect memory of everything he's heard since a young age.Unfortunately, what Shawn's been hearing lately makes him think that his father is planning to kill him, to "end his pain." Naturally, Shawn has his own thoughts about that plan, but knows that he's completely powerless to stop his father. Yet the father is not portrayed as a villain, but is sensitively drawn as a father who is just trying to do the right thing by his son.
First off, I don't enjoy writing negative reviews about pretty much anything; I respect the time and effort it takes in putting a production together and I'm always way more forgiving towards an ambitious project that fails as opposed to any by-the-number production that turns out exactly as expected. The only reason I'm writing this review is that this film actually bothered me enough to prompt me to do so, as I felt tricked into watching it based on positive reviews I encountered when some more negative reviews floating around could have spared me the time and mental anguish.I'm also going to attempt to get my opinion across without spoiling anything because, again as evidenced by the amount of positive reviews here and elsewhere, there is obviously some sort of audience for this film which isn't me, so to each their own. I guess the number one issue (in a sea of issues, but I digress) is the fact that the entire concept is so completely unbelievable to the point where it's actually condescending to the viewer. Again, I am truly willing to overlook certain aspects of a story and forgive filmmakers for going off on irrational tangents if the payoff is worth it, but at the end of this movie, if you truly soaked it in and weren't sidetracked by what the filmmakers expected you to ignorantly focus on instead, you will leave this angry and disappointed when trying to make it all connect afterwards (and not because you 'didn't get it').Taken straight off the cover is the tagline: "How far would you go to win the ultimate job?". First off, that sounds more like an interview question than a serious reward, right? Wouldn't the ultimate job actually be not having a job at all but still making enough money to travel and spend time with family and loved ones, etc? Or else doing something that you love and are passionate about and can do daily without having to worry about bills or your financial future in the meantime? So automatically, based on the fact that the people competing for this mysterious job don't even know what the job is can be a little suspect right off the bat, as that really only leaves a decent salary and professional accomplishment as true motivators.Don't get me wrong, landing an ultimate job would actually be great, but here we go to the main motivation of the story: if only one in eight will get the job, what happens to the other seven afterwards? Do they lose all their money and get demoted to the lowest rung on whatever band system their company structure allows? Do they die in some creative and tragic Saw-style death? The answer is nothing, they simply leave the room and go back to their life they knew before and they are free to apply for any new job they desire. Or how about this scenario: for the one person that did win the job and made, say, a $500K yearly salary, would you be more motivated for the actual job or just to win the amount of money the job would pay without actually having to work? I mean, a jobs a job, you still have a boss to suck up to and a demanding schedule, and at the assumed professional level of the mythical position, you would need to be a workaholic, 80-hour-a-week type personality to survive, and is that really a great reward after all?If you've followed me this far, this is why I conveyed it this way: the absolutely only way the motivations and actions of the characters could make any sense whatsoever is if whoever did not answer the exam correctly and win the job would in fact be tortured and murdered in grotesque fashion while the winner would receive unlimited funds for the rest of their life. There is absolutely no risk if the participants lose but it would be impossible to tell if you jumped in halfway through (and the ridiculousness progresses even further from anything coherent the longer you stick around). And really, this is not the only aspect I'm basing my rating for this movie on (and there are a lot more) but, as I've written this much on this one topic alone, I'm hoping to convey that all of the other elements (the acting, the `twists', the fact that there is no large company that would ever stage an event like this without killing off all of the participants afterwards to prevent the inevitable legal issues guaranteed to follow, etc.) are all done in the same insulting fashion. It's like, for every scene, the filmmaker says "look over there!" and you look over, see something confusing, and ask "why?". The response is "be quiet, you're gonna miss this! Now look over there!" over and over again.If you're on the fence and have stumbled across this movie looking for a hidden gem, remember there's a reason you've probably never heard of it, and I'd urge you not to fall for the surprisingly positive reviews as I did.
This book starts at 1956 - the beginning of the LP record. This is the last fair treatment of album music this book gives our American music history.I have just finished reading the book and listening to...all of the music up through 1969. Interesting that not ONE album from Motown is mentioned. However about 30 come from the British invasion. Before the Beatles, there were the Supremes who were the biggest force in American music, and groundbreaking race breakers. No mention. Marvin Gaye...no mention. But every psychadelic crap artist is listed, including imitations from Britain, where the psychadelic movement was an imitation anyway. I'm inclined to believe that intense druggie music writers compiled this book. Alas, the General Editor is from Rolling Stone magazine.Very disturbing, and very poor example. He should have thought this through a bit more before printing. Now, I can't read anymore of it now that it's obviously a complete farce.
If you are looking for comfort from the various foot problems, these are not for you, they lump in the wrong places, the toes bunch too close, and after awhile, the "softness" disappears especially after washing and hanging them to dry (don't put them in the dryer...)Really disappointed with this product.
This book was great fun to read! Nice writing style, very humorous, good characters. I'm hoping a sequel is in the works, because I'd love to read more!
IMO Avery continues to dominate the do-it-yourself business advertising market. The quality of the paper is superb - thick enough to not feel homemade, yet not as substantial as a professional business card. It would be nice to see a heavier weight paper offered, with the understanding that some home printers malfunction when the paper weight is too high.The Clean Edge system is where this business card paper really impresses. The edges on these cards are simply amazing. The perforation is so tiny that the edge looks nearly smooth. Other brands tend to leave a ridged edge that has feathery bits of paper jutting out. Also, the fold-back method to separate these cards is terrific. Never does a card edge rip and the process is very fast.Compared to any other brands that I've tried, these Avery Clean Edge Business Cards are my clear favorite. I have printed 3 packs of cards and will continue to purchase more as needed.My only gripe is that Avery release printer templates for more software than Microsoft Word. In print design, Microsoft Word is at the far bottom. Avery should consider that software from Adobe, Corel, and others have been mainstream for many years and release templates accordingly. It is possible to find Adobe and Corel compatible templates online, however Avery really ought to step up and release official templates on their website.
There aren't that many good books out there for beginner readers.... but this one is pretty good. It's a story. I would recommend it because it gives new readers confidence.
Best phone I've ever usedI've never gotten so excited over a phone before. I keep discovering neat design features which makes me say "wow - they really put some thought into this phone." First, the quality is phenomenal. This wireless actually sounds better than the AT&T; corded phone it replaced. It has much better range is and less susceptible to noise than my Vtech 900mhz - in fact, I don't hear any noise or static at all. My biggest concern was that I would not be able to pick up a line which was already "in use." On this phone, you can pick up any line like an analog phone, but can easily lock out the other extensions with a privacy feature.It's not just a phone, but a phone system, for which you can buy additional extensions and add them anywhere without installing additional phone jacks. You can transfer calls to a different extension, as well as intercom or conference with other extensions. You can take your wireless phones with you when you travel and use them as walkie-talkies! You can use one extension like a room/baby monitor, or perhaps just find out what's going on downstairs. The base doubles as an independent speaker phone, so it's like getting two phones for the price of one - with a convenient handset finder. Expandable to up to 10 handsets, each extension has its own speaker phone, which blew me away. Each extension, as well as the base, has its own searchable phonebook of 100 numbers plus speed dial - and, the entries of the phonebook can be sent from one handset to another. The list of features goes on, but what really blows me away is the quality and clarity of this phone. It's also a lot smaller than it looks in the photo. You can almost put one of these handsets into your shirt pocket, making them very "cellular-phone like," including the many ringer tone options, including off. When a call comes in, the Caller-ID display lights up bright and an LED flashes, so you don't need to have every extension ring - for those "quiet rooms." Each extension has a headpiece jack so you can walk around hands-free.Complaints / Suggestions for improvements? I honestly can't think of any. This phone is perfection.
As the other reviewers have stated, the strength of this DVD is the wealth of film on all the major types of guns used by the Germans in World War 2. Nearly all the film is unique, not used in other war documentaries. The accompanying narration for the most part is accurate.The only reason I didn't give this five stars is that I wish the documentary had included some close-up views of exactly how one loads, aims, fires, and maintains these weapons.That said, I'm glad I purchased this DVD.
I've been a fan of this series for years, but this one was really disappointing. One almost gets the impression that Braun herself has lost interest in the series...(IF she even writes the books anymore!?) Of course, the books have always been slow, but they did have a certain charm to them, making them the perfect bedtime material...but, boy, did I sleep well,when I was reading THIS one...
It's been very difficult to find Gary Stewart CD's and let me say my dad is so enjoying this CD he plays it over and over. I need to find other ones know so I don't have to listen to the same one. Thanks again.
This comic, like Superman: Peace On Earth changed comics in a sense. The comic is HUGE and by huge I don't mean thick, but H-U-G-E. Batman is not full of gadgets and a fast car, but rather watered down to a man with some rope and a grappling hook as he fights crime in the ghettos of Gotham. He comes to terms with what he might have been after his parents were murdered when he meets a young boy who's parents were murdered in front of him. Batman realizes after his parents death he could have turned to a life of crime instead of crime fighting.
A good friend recommended this book to me. She found the book highly entertaining and inspirational. I found it very depressing and "uninspirational". If this book is supposed to influence women to find and assert themselves, then I think it falls far short. Edna is a selfish, spoiled young wife and mother who in my opinion became bored with her life. She was unappreciative and she was not brave enough to do something constructive about it. IF she had chosen to walk away from her home and family and pursue something that would fulfill her solitary life or help others I would have at least tried to understand her way of thinking. She did not "free" herself as so many commentaries will lead readers to believe. She simply made a dismal prison for herself. If she had at the very least dedicated herself to becoming the artist she could have and showed the world she could support herself without the aid of her husband, then I would have grudgingly admired her even though her selfish decisions affected her children and her husband. We are supposed to think that by her suicide she freed her soul to become one with the solitary sea. What rubbish....she let her emotions rule her thinking. The doctor was right. She was going through a spell of some sort. She was obviously sick in some way. I did not feel sorry for her; I felt sorry for her husband who tried to give her space to find herself. And her poor children. They did not ask to come into the world and of course they needed their mother. If this book is supposed to help women understand that their roles are just as important as men's roles and that they are not second class citizens, then it has failed miserably. I would NOT recommend this book for young women who are looking for inspiration to become all they can be. Unfortunately, all it proves is what some men would have us believe....we let our emotions rule us and that in a moment of intense weakness we are not strong enough to face the world and carry on. Edna let her love for a man, Robert, define who she was. By all means read this book if you are down on men and the wonderfully fulfilling traditional role of wife and motherhood, but don't expect to be uplifted or inspired by it. It aggravated me more than anything. I would like to add this...Chopin's writing is beautifully descriptive. She did make me see, smell, and even hear the setting of her story. Very few writers have been able to do this. I would certainly read more stories by the author although I have a feeling I will not agree with her view points. She did have a great talent.
"Paradise Lost meets Lacuna Coil"....Um I don't think so. Paradise Lost maybe. Flowing tears sound nothing like Lacuna Coil that's number 1 but they are signed to the same label Century Media.Unfortunatley Century Media have spent the better of 2005-2006 promoting Karmacode for Lacuna Coil, where as they did nothing for Flowing Tears. That in itself is sad because Razorbliss is one of the best female gothic albums I have heard this year.New frontwoman Helen Vogt is not your typical high pitched, operative style vocalist. She has a deep, sexy husky voice. Love it!Originally named Flowing Tears And Withered Flowers when they formed in 1994, drummer Christian Zimmer (recently killed in a car crash with original guitarist Bjorn Lorson), guitarist/ keyboardist Benjamin Buss, vocalist Manfred Bersin, and drummer Frederic Lesny hooked up and recorded Swansongs in 1996. Female vocalist Stefanie Duchene and drummer Eric Hilt were added to the lineup and Bersin switched to guitarist for their sophomore release, 1998's Joy Parade. Big things happened when they shortened the name to Flowing Tears and released two successful albums (2000's Jade and 2002's Serpentine) which saw the band move in a more gothic direction, leaving behind their doom metal roots. Now new vocalist Helen Vogt steps in for Razorbliss, which was originally released last year but now Magick Records brings it to North American audiences.It is a sad and undeniable shame that the societal majority has grown increasingly accustomed to accepting what marketing and advertising force-feeds them, as opposed to selecting the best alternative. If indeed the latter were the case it is not inconceivable that Germany's Flowing Tears would long ago have enjoyed a much greater level of popularity. Bred from the same generic stock as their label mates Lacuna Coil, _Razorbliss_ is the first Flowing Tears record to feature Helen Vogt on microphone duties -- and in case anyone is wondering, yes, aside from being quite fetching, she is also much better than her predecessor, Stefanie Duch?ne. In fact, word has it that she is largely to thank for the band's heavier approach this time round. That said though, every member of Flowing Tears has done a terrific job on _Razorbliss_, and particularly "Radium Angel" and "Believe" stand out as the highlights of their effort.
&quot;hold your fire&quot; is a rich and powerfull pop-rock album with memorable bass guitar riffs and a lot of synthesisers.compared to &quot;grace under pressure&quot; or their other albums it is a true gem and an album most emjoyable from their whole 80's discography.
This novel seemed to be preceeded by a lot of hype. I guess the time span between this and Smith's previous novel, "A Simple Plan," plus the following garnered from the solid film that "Plan" was turned into made the release of "The Ruins" a media event. Having enjoyed that film along with the blitz of advertising that included a testimonial from Stephen King, I couldn't wait to pick up "The Ruins." I wish I was still waiting.Someone once said suspense is created when you put ordinary people you care about in an extrordinary situation. So we have a group of twenty-somethings going deep into the mysterious jungles of Mexico only to find a whole bunch of trouble. Where this novel misses is in the words "care about" and "extraordinary." The main characters are non-descript and have about as much depth as the unknown crew member in the old Star Trek series; you know, the guy who will be vaporized before the opening credits. And the extraordinary situation ends up bordering on the ridiculous, not to mention boring and repetitive.I won't rehash the reviews here except to say I found the story completely uninvolving and the suspense non-existent. I have read about 141 pages and am questioning if I should go further. My hunch is this book is not even as good as the poorest thing Stephen King has written. Maybe that is reason for his testimonial-you'll appreciate his poorer books even more after reading this pile of preposterous drivel.
Commander Fuchida Mitsuo, leader of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, along with co-author Okumiya Masatake, provide the most intimate Japanese account of the turning point at sea of World War II. Discussion of &quot;victory&quot; disease which lead to faulty dispositions and assumptions about what America would do rather than what she could do perceptively explains the disaster which the Nihon Kaigon (Imperial Japanese Navy ) experienced. The Kido Butai (First Striking Force) was destroyed as a unit at Midway, but Japanese naval airpower was not critically hurt until the Battle of Santa Cruz. This book is an absolute must for any student of the Pacific War. Even after 40 plus years, it has yet to be surpassed.
If you're fond of mystery series with a comic touch (think Monk and Remington Steele and Moonlighting), you're sure to love this endearing 90s series about an earnest Canadian Mountie exiled to police duty in Chicago. Paul Gross is pitch perfect as the Mountie who constantly surprises his Windy City colleagues with his brilliance and insights into human nature. Diefenbaker, of course, is not really a wolf but plays one on the show. Now a heavyweight Hollywood script writer (Flags of Our Fathers, Million Dollar Baby, Crash), the show's creator Paul Haggis assured that the quality of writing for Due South was at a very high level. This show isn't only funny, it's smart and affecting. It's true that the visual quality of these disks is mediocre at best--that's why I wouldn't give it 5 stars--but it's still well worth the investment of $20 (price at this writing) to get all three seasons of this wonderful show.P.S. Now the first two seasons of this show can be found at a certain major discount store for only $5 per season.
i love this movie it has everything i need giant man eating snake swallows people whole heck the movie even gots lots of gory types this movie should be rated R i dont know who rated it PG-13.
The Ghost Recon franchise is prolific and evolving. 2 is a big change over 1 from FPS into FPS/TPS - 3rd person over-the-shoulder. More games should employ the FPS/TPS choice (Elder Scrolls does). Commands are new, interface new, weapons new. The gun with the TV screen is cool. Lone Wolf missions new. Voice acting new. There are some fierce massive firefights in this one over previous Ghost Recon games. The spirit is the same - squad-based military shooter. Great game.
This is one of the best publications on the Aztecs, a major historical source that is accessible and fascinating. University of California Press made a mistake by including color illustrations and giving this a high price. It was always pricey for assignment for college classes, and now its out of print. It would have been better to give up the color illustrations and lower the price. But in any case this book it is worth looking at for anyone interested in the Aztecs, Mesoamerica, or native American cultures.
It was hard for me to decide whether to get this SU 800 remote or not. I have 4 pocket wizards that can do off camera shoots but there are several limitations and shortcomings with the pocket wiz....all it does is trigger the flash off camera with the output being manually set. Sometimes you would even miss to trigger when your flash is on standby mode.When I saw this SU 800 remote I was intrigued to try it since it can do TTL wirelessly and sure it works....very very nice. No more missed shots and no more overexposed shoots because the output adjusts automatically. This is really one great addition to my gear!! Great work nikon....great work...I am really happy with this unit!!It can remotely control as many as 4 groups of off camera flashes as you wish...no limits and you can even control the flash output of each flash unit, isn't it amazing?? This will be good for location shoots for small groups and will really come handy for all commercial photographers outdoor who thinks pocket wiz is all there is to work with!The only caveat is that you have to be in the line of sight with the with camera which is not a big deal....great work nikon, great work and keep innovating!
This is such a powerful movie that you'll forget you're reading. I highly recommend this movie!
Attractive, fit, intelligent woman in an action film. Who needs a story line when there is plenty of action to excite your viewing experience. But then there is one. She runs fast and looks good doing it.
For those unfamiliar with the author, Kenneth Kalmer was the only doctor on Mt Everest during the 1996 tragedy. This book touches on human physiology and how we adapt to and tolerate extremes in environmental conditions. It contains valuable information with which every adventurer should be acquainted. Though it is written for the layman, this is certainly not the kind of book you can read just before going to sleep. It's pretty heavy on scientific principles.Dr Kalmer begins with the jungle environment, namely the Amazon forest and swamps. Though heat exhaustion can be a problem here, most of the hazards of this environment seem to come from the denizens of the jungle. Survivors in this environment need to keep a constant lookout for the anopheles mosquito (malaria), black caiman, anaconda, venomous snakes, poisonous frogs and caterpillars, schisto worm (liver parasite), stingray, electric eel and a most interesting creature called the candiru. This is actually a very tiny catfish which has a great affinity for salt. When an animal urinates under water, this tiny creature will follow the stream of urine and lodge itself in the animal's urethra. Surgery is required to remove it.Ironically, the jungle is also a natural pharmacy that provides medicines to heal the sick as well as poisons for blowdart hunting. No wonder people still live there.The next hostile environment is the open sea - endless stretches of water, not a drop of which can keep the castaway's body hydrated. Dr Kalmer gives many examples of how castaways survive. The world record is held by Chinese sailor Poon Lim, who drifted on a raft for 130 days without supplies. He collected rain water and used a spring in his torch to catch fish. Methods thought up by other survivors include using improvised solar-powered stoves to distill seawater. The physiology of salt intake, dehydration and starvation are presented along with some coverage on cannibalism at sea.The scorching desert is an even more hostile environment that causes heat exhaustion, dehydration and starvation to set in even more rapidly. Dr Kalmer explains in detail how the body regulates temperature and maintains a constant internal environment. He also explains how this system can break down under extreme external temperature and dehydration. Death occurs with the loss of 15-20 litres of body fluids. However, defying the limits of human physiology, is one Mauro Prosperi, who claimed to have survived for 9 days in the desert without any water.Diving medicine is a very big topic by itself, but Dr Kalmer gives us the essentials on what happens to the body during free diving, the mechanics of SCUBA as well as the causes of decompression sickness. As with the other environments, many examples of diving accidents along with a microscopic view of what went on inside the victims' bodies are presented.High altitude medicine is one area where Dr Kalmer has the most firsthand experience. Bringing out actual situations he encountered on Himalayan expeditions, the author presents a flowing account of Himalayan expeditions alongside an "insiders'" view of the characters' bodies. The mechanics of AMS (acute mountain sickness), HAPE (high altitude pulmonary edema), HACE (high altitude cerebral edema) and frostbite are neatly woven into the story. Dr Kalmer even proposes a somewhat controversial evolutionary advantage that the Sherpas may have over other people. Even more surprising but factually indisputable, is his mention of the "miraculous" survival of Beck Weathers and Pasang Sherpa.The final chapter is really out of this world - space adventure. Space is the ultimate hostile environment combining extreme cold, extreme heat, vacuum and cosmic radiation from which the human body must be almost completely insulated. Topics covered include the physiological effects of G force and zero gravity. Also mentioned are research projects into building self-sufficient spacecrafts for interplanetary exploration. Interesting hypothetical situations are presented and Dr Kalmer manages not to bore the reader with his wit and humour.
This goes into my top 3 of disappointing games. All hype and no substance. Yes, there are pretty graphics but they are not the prettiest I've ever seen in a racing game. But besides that, there is nothing. The car lineup is pitiful and the fun factor I don't mean to start a war about which console is better b/c they both (PS3 and Xbox 360) have their strengths and weaknesses...but one day when I was bored and at Best Buy I decided to pick up Project Gotham Racing 4. Heck, I hadn't even realized it came out b/c there was little to no fan fare. But having played it, it is SO much more fun than GT5. If you want to argue that GT5 is not meant to be fun but is a realistic simulator, I am emphatic in the fact that the two do not have to be mutually exclusive and PGR4 proves it. As a simulator, it is far, far better than GT5...each car has such a different feel and SOUND. (GT5 is really weak in the sound area...there is little variation between each engine.) And, PGR4 manages to be a fun game. Like I said, I'm not here to start a war but GT5 is so over-hyped and was a major disappointment. For a game that was featured on 60 minutes I expect more. There aren't many games that I actually would give to someone for free but this is one of them.
I saw this movie on cable TV a year ago and thought it was very entertaining and worth watching again. I looked online to buy a copy but found that it was not available on DVD. So I was very surprised to see that it recently became available to buy. Amazon has it available for $20.99 which they reduced from $24.00 but you can buy the movie on www.towerrecords.com for $13.99 and pay no shipping charge if you purchase $20.00 or more. Enjoy!
We put this on our patio to keep flies out of the house when we use the back door, and it has really worked. No flies at all getting in now!04-20-11 UPDATE: Stilll using these every Spring & Summer for a "no fly zone" around our patio. These work the best of all the fly traps we've tried!
I've always loved this movie, but I thought the Blu-Ray picture quality was about average. The audio may be better than the DVD, or it might be my imagination. If you already have this on DVD, I'd say it's not worth buying the Blu-Ray unless you're a huge fan of the movie. But without any extra content or other special goodies, the Blu-Ray isn't significantly better than the DVD.
Cristina's voice is one of the most impressive voices in Portugal. She also represents the &quot;saudade&quot; (saudade has no accurate translation to other languages, means missing someone, love, sadness, and some contradictory feelings, it is very representative of what fado is). Her songs are beautiful too.
IS ABSOLUTELY SOOTHING TO MY SOUL, PLUS ALL THE BEAUTY AND MUSICIS TO WONDERFUL TO IMAGINE.I READ "90 MINUTES IN HEAVEN" 1 WEEK AFTER READING "23 MINUTES IN HELL."HEAVEN IS WHERE I WANT TO GO.I THANK GOD,THE CREATOR OF MAN FOR HIS LOVE AND SHARING HEAVENWITH HIS CHILDREN.
I saw this playing in a Christian bookstore and bought it. I normally don't care for any kind of Christian movie. Movies are a medium more condusive to entertainment than faith. I think this is generally true but I don't hold a doctrine that excludes video or motion picture as a teaching medium. So I was attracted to this video because I could see that it was sharing a story in a captivating way. It is shared at the 3-6 year old level, and I have two boys in that range.Technically the animation is superior to old-school stop frame (think Hanna Barbara). The computer facilitates very fluid motion. The coloration is very rich and the lighting is so detailed it's very fascinating to see, but neither is particularly realistic. The artwork is obviously very stylized but it suffices in that it is sober and practical. The figures and landscape are niether comic nor elaborate. Compared to contemporary, hollywood-class animation this should be expected to reflect a considerably lower budget.In terms of the pace of the action, it is slow compared to most children's television or something like Prince of Egypt. For children that are continually exposed to rapid-fire electronic media and immersive hypersensory entertainment, this might be remarkable. I do not allow my children to "vegetate" in front of a continual stream of entertainment. We don't even have a TV. We do watch film and video on the computer only very purposefully. Because we don't constantly expect a hyperactive pace of amusement, we were able to find the dramatic pause and silence in these videos captivating rather than boring.Let's face it. Before this, we haven't had a whole lot of quality Christian animation. Veggie-Tales has managed to persist depsite being silly and anti-Christ. I can appreciate Veggie Tales to some degree but the schtick is only good for so much. It's totally incapable of dealing with any truly serious subject matter, and does in fact totally exclude Christ, choosing rather to stay within mere "bible" topics. So while Veggie Tales avoids the gospel, this content is by contrast explicit.
I like it with milk. I am no crazy about tea. I love this tea. I was drinking too much coffee. I was giving myself headaches. This tea is so satisfying. It reminds me of coffee. I love it. I can drink it all day. It is supposed to be filled with anti oxidents. I hate green tea so this is great....
Okay, it isn't, but Bob's voice sounds just like the guy who rides the bomb. And that's one of the few redeeming features of this movie. It has so many problems: the irritating, platitude-spouting robot Vincent; the distracting musical cues; the muddled theology and incomprehensible ending, where we see ... &lt;spoiler warning&gt; ... hell? and heaven? (Maybe the movie is a remake of Dante's Inferno--would that make Vincent Vergil?). Not to mention the wooden acting all 'round, the inappropriate &quot;slapstick&quot; moments involving the robots, and the collapse of the plot halfway through the movie, resulting in character behavior which makes no sense. The picture quality was decent, though, except during some f/x sequences where the picture seemed choppy or in jerky slow motion.
A very thorough account of the Circus Fire in Hartford in 1944. I was transported back to a time and place I never knew and felt as if I were there. I had heard of the unidentified little blonde girl, but thought I had read that she was indentified. After reading this, one is left wondering once again. I read this in one sitting and I would imagine you will also.
i used it on my US issue holsters as well as on western type holsters and beltsmade a huge differencebasically from a piece of wood type stiffness to pliable leather
WHY IS THIS BOOK CONSIDERED A MYSTERY??? WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS AMAZON SITE???
Manu Chao recommended this album and I haven't looked back. The music is very varied and quite simply superb. Even Manu Chao would be delighted with the rapidity of change of style between the industrial punk of 'El Borrego' to the beautiful Mexican ballad 'Esa noche'. In fact one senses the heavy influence this album had on Manu's own development- I wouldn't be surprised to learn that 'Me Gustas Tu' was his answer to the lyrics at the end of 'El Borrego' and anyone who knows 'Proxima Estacion Esperanza' will feel instantly at home with the guitar rifts of 'Pez'. Kosme's vocals have the power to make or break songs- on this album they make them but unfortunately on most other Cafe Tacuba albums they are the weak link. Highlights too numerous to mention- 17 of the 20 songs are vying to be the best on the album. This is a CD which takes some getting used to so don't worry if you don't 'get it' first time round. When I first heard it I only liked 2 or 3 songs now I like it all. I have now worn out three copies of this masterpiece.
There is no other voice that compares !! 'Nuff said !!
First the good news: I can understand the majority of high ratings in other reviews. This film looks fantastic and those used to Hollywood big-budget fare will not find it wanting.The cinimetography is wonderful, and there are moments of simple, unadalterated beauty woven into the dark, rainy atmosphere. The scenes of the protagonist's cyborg sitting on a bench at the beach (within a hologram) are enchanting. Everything from her pose on the bench to the vibrant color that so contrasts with the rest of the film is profoundly affecting.The special effects are first-rate, yet exist to provide an environment, not become the focus of attention.Speaking of focus, that's the good and bad of this film. The acting is superb, but you can't concentrate on their faces because you have to read the subtitles. Dialogue dubbing has improved dramatically in recent years, and this film is begging for an English surround track.That said, there are other problems. First, the gist of the plot is that a cyborg hunter cop is stealing AI chips in an attempt to extend the life of his expiring cyborg girlfriend, whom he has fallen in love with. Not a problem in iteself, but there is absolutely no indication for almost the entire film of any affection between them. Only in a flashback sequence at the end do you see any signs of the love they supposedly share. For the most part, she just sits around looking blankly at the ground.Second, Natural City falls victem to the bad idea of filming the combat scenes too close. I don't understand why filmmakers do this, but all you see is twirling black-clad bodies that take up the entire frame, with no sense of their surroundings, then a quick cut to someone getting offed. Back up a little, please!So, a mixed bag of the great and the bad. I want to rate it higher because of it's undoubted quality, but the lows sadly beat the highs. An English (or substitute your language of choice) track so you can watch the talented cast, better framing of the fight scenes, and a more genuine portrayal of the protagonist's relationship with his cyborg (this is the whole purpose of the movie, remember) would have made this an easy four stars. As it stands, it's a great visual and acting treat made sour by some poor decisions.
If the 55-episode first season of G.I. Joe is the show's best, then this collection is quite frankly the crown jewels. Among the episodes included in this box set are &quot;There's No Place Like Springfield&quot; (the series best episode), &quot;Worlds Without End&quot; (the alternately shocking and hilarious &quot;What If...?&quot; two-parter), &quot;The Wrong Stuff&quot; (a still-timely parody of TV and the, er, minds, behind it), and &quot;Cold Slither&quot; (the hilarious fan-favorite featuring the Dreadnoks as the rock band Cold Slither).While the animation is sometimes lacking by today's standards, it was nothing short of a revolution in 1985, as was the writing, which is still some of the best in the history of televised animation in the US. The voice acting is also top-notch, which comes as no surprise given a cast that includes such legends as Michael Bell, B.J. Ward, Neil Ross, John Stephenson, Frank Welker, and the late Chris Latta.The episodes on this disc are again remastered excellently, although &quot;Hearts and Cannons&quot; seems to have video from a cleaned up broadcast master, as opposed to the 35mm source film. Also, a long-standing edit in &quot;There's No Place Like Springfield&quot; Part II has been retained, as has been the case for all airings except the very first. The one special feature is an interview with Bill Ratner and Mary McDonald-Lewis, the voices of Flint and Lady Jaye, which is great fun to watch.Despite the upheld edit (wherein Shipwreck's &quot;daughter&quot; points a bazooka at the Joe and calls him a &quot;drip&quot; before being knocked down by Polly), which will hopefully be corrected by Rhino, this set is another dream come true for G.I. Joe fans, cartoon fans, and especially Flint and Lady Jaye fans (which isn't to say that the episodes themselves don't provide some goodness for long-suffering Duke and Scarlett fans, mind you). Strongly recommended.
Normally, I don't, and until recently, it doesn't seem that Nikon has awakened to the fact that back-side sensors make sense!If you don't have a back-side sensor, and you don't want to hassle with getting in front of the camera...also, if you care about decisive moments, get a corded electronic release.One of these came with my first Nikon DSLR, and I've used it five time in six years. I wouldn't have paid for one.
Rating says the game is good, but it's definitely not for everyone. Those who are used to the Final Fantasy series by Square will probably be disappointed by this game because, quite simply - they are of different genres. FF is a pure, solid, RPG game without a trace element of Action, Adventure, or Puzzle. Vagrant Story, on the other hand, is a combination of all 4 above genres - and the result is not only fun and entertaining, but exciting as well.Breakdown-Graphics - Absolutely beautiful detail, high polygonal characters with lush backgrounds and well-designed dungeons. It's good to see that Square does really good work with graphics even without touching CGI FMV. Lots of little graphical tweaks (like accurate shadows, detailed faces) make this game beautiful to watch. Best of all, all of the cut scenes are presented using in-game graphics, with almost cinematic camera shots and techniques - it feels like you're watching a movie.Music/Sound - Great for atmospherics, but nothing too memorable for me other than the intro music (played alongside the only FMV sequence in the entire game). This is probably the poorest section of the game, especially given Square's reputation for hiring composers such as Nobuo Uematsu to do their wonderful orchestrated music.Storyline - Two thumbs up, the story progresses at a nice, even pace and there aren't any ridiculous twists and turns in the plotline that make it sound forced. The ending is one hell of a clincher...and definitely some of the clearer work that Square has done recently.Characters - Well developed, etc. etc. I like the characters. We get to know them relatively well, and any information that we don't receive isn't very important to begin with.System - This is where the game shines. The Parasite Eve style battle system, offence/defence chain abilities, and workshop ideas are all awesome. Plus, for the hardcore gamer, technicalities such as weapon vulnerability, elemental affinity, and monster type all play a role in effecting the damage you do.It's a great game. Buy it. But only if you're not one of those narrow minded people who thinks there is no Square outside of Final Fantasy.
Streets &amp; Trips 2004 crashes every time I try to find a particular address. MDAC 2.8 and Jet 4.0 Service Pack 8 didn't fix anything. Nice software, Microsoft. What is it that you do again?
Priced right compared to other lightweights. It has a crankcase,that should extend it's life. Enough guts for the small jobber.Satisfys my nail gun (framing & roofing) requiements. Perhaps a few less nails per minute than some other more expensive units.
And a great price. I was looking for a DVD player that could easily be converted to play DVDs from outside region 1. This unit has that ability. A secret code can be entered through the remote to change the region or to make it region free!The unit feels well built with a (mostly) metal case. The remote has lots of features, but I keep mixing up the chapter forward and reverse with fast forward and revind buttons. The fast forward only goes up to 8x I wish it would go faster. I love the dynamic range control. It evens out the volume on movies that go from too-quiet-to-hear to waking-the-dead-loud. I don't have to keep turning the volume up and down.I've had mine for nearly 6 months and no troubles. Hopefully the problems some others have reported have been fixed.
This is a fascinating description of a small society in Borneo that evokes lots of thoughts about our own and the implicit assumptions we make about life, the world and social/moral behavior. It's also one of those wonderful rare anthropological studies that keeps reminding us that "traditional" people don't necessarily buy all their own myths or conform to all of their daily rules for living than we do ourselves.Geddes is an exceptionally enjoyable writer to read. The book isn't long, so take the time to savor his dry-humored voice and style.
Great swing. Two things about it make me give it 4 stars instead of 5. First, the music is annoying, but that is true of every baby item we have that makes noise, even Baby Einstein CDs. Second, the way that the toys are hooked to the tray makes it so that they hit on the side of the swing when you raise the tray (and of course they make noise and can wake baby up....not good if you have just worked hard to get him to sleep!)
I own the Hamilton Beach humidifier and have to purchase these from time to time. They last about two or three weeks, and I have the humidifier going constantly. They are very easy to replace - just lift the unit up and drop it in (after taking out the old soggy one first). Not only do these filter the air, they draw the water up out of the pan in the bottom of the unit so can be transferred to the air moving through. If you leave it in too long it will begin to smell, like anything you leave in water too long. I buy four or five at once, so I always have one on hand.
I picked up this book at the bookstore (I wish I hadn't wasted my money), as I was looking through it this lady approaches me and tells me it's great, I should read it and so on. I was hesitant for some reason even though the cover is very cool, the praise from so many other authors/book critics and the description on the back. So I bought it. Ironically the first 30 pages of the book are entertaining, although I quickly learn that the author has no clue with regards to love.I keep reading, waiting and waiting for Zafon to get somewhere, get to a sub-plot or closer to the plot, instead he goes off on some political nonsense. The guy that gets raped, how is that relevant to the story and it doesn't fit the theme of the book. He brings in Stalin. There is so much irrelevant stuff from dialogue to characters that has nothing to do with the story. The characters are so black and white (figuratively), there is no gray, they are one-dimensional, they are either good or bad, all this sentimental crap--I stopped reading at about page 170. I should finish but I don't care, I don't care what happens. If somebody wants to tell me what happens, please do. I have no patience for this so called story.It's like a bad movie but I can't fast forward.I also can't believe that Zafon has been compared to Eco, or Reverte. I don't think so. Zafon must have some connections in the publishing world. Good for him.Also the people that have given this book 5 stars, shocking, is this the first book you've ever read? Pathetic.
When I first listened to this cd I hated it because most of the beats are subpar, and Twiztid tries to do a lot of singing on this one. (Which if you've ever read any of my reviews you know I hate.) But, after listening to it a few more times, it grew on me a little. "Afraid Of Me" has some really deep lyrics on it (Especially from Monoxide.) and can be a pretty inspirational song. Mike E. Clark also made the beat for "Wondering Why" which kicks ass, and Tech N9ne and E-40 (which are probably my two favorite rappers) both make great guest appearances. Overall I think this cd could've been a classic because of all the great artists Twiztid was working with, but in the end they dropped the ball with a lot of wack beats. (Serial Killaz is an example.) Looks like we'll never see another Mostasteless.
I got The New Guy because it boasts a really funny cast. I love Eliza Dushku, and DJ Qualls was hilarious in Road Trip! But, I'm sad to say, The New Guy was a FLOP!The storyline was horrible! Dizzy, the school dork , DJ Qualls, gets tossed in jail for breaking a mop, I mean come on! And he gets schooled on how to be a "bad boy" by all the inmates there. I know it the story sounds funny, but, really it's not.He tranfers to a new school, new look and all, and shows what a punk he is. In the end everything kind of muddles into place.Well, if you want to see a funny movie, don't get this one, it's a let down! Get Road Trip or American Pie, they will have you rolling on the floor!
I expected this to be a historical movie about the British movement to appease Germany just before World War 2, with a murder mystery thrown in. However, its purpose is to be a horror movie--which is why the plot doesn't make sense. Viewers are forced to continually watch a sensitive, beautiful, likeable young woman increasingly betrayed by almost everyone she loves, plus people she barely knows. She's lied to, humiliated, imprisoned, starved, terrorized, and is forced to watch her friends brutally murdered or discover their corpses. If you empathize with her, and it's hard not to, it feels like being psychologically tortured yourself. Why put yourself through this experience? The only things this movie has in its favor are beautiful settings and costumes, and you can see those in plenty of other movies and TV series.
DVD never arrived. Tried to contact seller on 3 occassions however they never replied to let me know what happened. Filed complaint with Amazon who refunded the full price I paid.
ASTOUNDING in its clarity and intensity, this is truly a treatise of epic proportions. Dr. Roberts has succinctly yet completely touched on a much ignored subject, with insight and warmth. With so much of history focusing on the male experience of post-war France, this is truly refreshing.BUY THIS BOOK -- you won't regret it.
This is an awesome story of one man's struggle to survive against insurmountable odds. Truly incredible. If it were not a true story, I would have trouble believing it.
This episode of JCW seemed so much more real--the violence, the people, ICP and the crowd were more real. The commentary was probably the funniest thing i've heard from ICP and their apperances were small but they were funny as hell. I have to say, with a low budget, ICP can definitely make a classic. Somethings in this could be difficult for a regular wrestling viewer to understand. THATS CUZ ITS FOR JUGGALOS ONLY! Anyone of the biggots who say ICP has no talent should watch this and see how funny they are. Buy this, watch it 10 times and pass it on to another juggalo. mmfcl
Four stars might be one star too many for PIG HUNT but I have to admit, I enjoyed this film quite a lot! This isn't the best Horror movie to come out of seemingly nowhere, but it sure is a fun and enjoyable ride never the less!When it comes down to "killer pig" movies, there isn't a wide selection out there. With the exception of films like RAZORBACK (directed by Russell Mulcahy who did HIGHLANDER) and PIGS (aka DADDY'S DEADLY DARLING), it's kind of an obscure Horror genre. It's too bad really because wild pigs themselves can be pretty scary and intimidating if used in the right way. Especially because some of them can grow to enormous sizes in nature! (Update : There's another pig themed Horror movie titled CHAWZ that came out recently from Korea. It's pretty good but I still think PIG HUNT is much better in terms of Horror.)PIG HUNT is directed by James Isaac (who did THE HORROR SHOW aka HOUSE III and JASON X) and with a soundtrack done by the amazing Les Claypool, this film turns out to be a nice little hidden gem in the world of "killer pig" movies. Out of all the big budget, Hollywood disappointments as of late (Wes Craven's MY SOUL TO TAKE, I'm looking in your direction), it's nice to see a gritty "direct to DVD" release that doesn't hold back any punches! This is how a low budget Horror movie should be made! Bloody, gory, offensive and over the top. For those of you who thought James Isaac dropped the ball on JASON X (a film in which I myself have a few problems with, but still found it to be a little enjoyable), take a look at PIG HUNT. It's much better if you ask me. Sure, it might not be the most original Horror movie out there, but at least it's competantly made and "cut throat" in terms of style and gore special effects.The basic story is about this group of friends who decide to take in a weekend of hunting in the woods, beer drinking and camping out. You know, the usual Horror movie character staples. The main character (John) seems to have something of a past in the town around the woods, and soon the local rednecks show up and start making trouble for him and his friends. After a while, we come to realise that John knows a few of these "good 'ol boys" from his childhood and they prove to be helpful in hunting the local wild life, which happens to be wild hogs.Meanwhile, there also seems to be something huge and terrifying in the woods, stalking and killing other random people in awful ways. Given the fact this movie is called PIG HUNT, I'm sure it comes as no surprise to audiences that it's a giant wild hog doing the killing. Through out the rest of the film, strange and seemingly off beat things happen (a group of machete wielding hippies show up out of nowhere), which gives this movie a different flavor than the usual Slasher movie.The actors do a good enough job here and the over all camera work is well done. What makes this movie work better than most "direct to DVD" Horror films is the fact that it doesn't try to do things it can't. The director makes use of the small budget and puts it all together in a neat little Horror movie. You won't find any bad and pointless CGI here.Like I said before, this isn't the most original Horror film out there. Anyone who's seen WRONG TURN or TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE knows the formula well, but that shouldn't prevent anybody from seeing PIG HUNT. This is the perfect Horror movie for a large group party and late night drinking with friends. Simple enough and short enough to be fun and enjoyable for everybody watching it. PIG HUNT also tries to be original in small and different ways.The gore is pretty good for only being rated R (unlike the always welcome "unrated" Horror film) and the huge wild hog "Pigzilla" is kept off camera until the very end of the film. This technique is something the director Stephen Spielberg used with his own killer shark movie JAWS, which speaks for itself. When they actually do show the giant pig at the end of the movie, it doesn't disappoint! No CGI to be found here! Just good old fashion prosthetics, make up, latex and hands on special effects! Talk about refreshing!Gore Hounds, check it out for scenes of horrible mutilations and the amazing special effects of "Pigzilla!" It might not be up to the gore expectations of films like WRONG TURN, but that's mainly due to the low budget. Outside of that, this movie does wonders with everything it has. About halfway through the film, there is an impressive car chase sequence in the middle of the woods (with the rednecks chasing our main characters) that actually had me at the edge of my seat for a moment! It's fast paced and totally unexpected. Sure, it's not going to blow the car chase sequences from BULLITT (Steve McQueen) or DEATH PROOF (Quentin Tarantino) out of the water, but it doesn't need to.What else can I say about PIG HUNT? This is just meant to be a fun and enjoyable film. You get what you expect from a movie boasting a giant monster hog on the DVD cover! By the way, don't judge this movie by it's cover art. Sure, the picture on the front makes it look like one of those awful made for TV, SyFy Channel affairs but it isn't. Far from it my friends. SyFy wished they made movies this good! Give PIG HUNT a chance. You might be pleasantly surprised in the end!Anymore, it seems like the "direct to DVD" Horror films are besting the big budget Hollywood releases! I'll take "Fangoria Fright Fest", "Ghost House Pictures" and "8 Horror Films To Die For" any day over the garbage in theaters!I've said my bit.Over and out.
When I first saw this on television about 20 years ago, I couldn't help but shed some tears. You can't help but love this life-form that they never intended for it to be human or to be with humans. But, Daryl is more than just a robot, he's human and lovable and anyone, regardless of age will fall in love with him.
I picked this book up because my maiden name is Bragg. I took it on a road trip with my husband. After reading the 1st page, I started reading the book out loud to my husband. Rick Bragg has such a way with words. You can visualize, taste and smell everything he tells you. It is so incredibly vivid.You are able to identify with, and root for his family. This is one of the best books I have ever read. I am now buying the rest of his books. My girlfriends are fighting over who gets it next based on the snippets I read aloud. This is not "light" reading. It grabs you and takes you for a ride as if you were standing next to him while it happened.This is a keeper. I can not recommend this book highly enough. If you like Mitch Albom, you will like these stories. Even if you don't you should like these. They are true to life portraits that come alive with his words.
The title of this DVD and the product description are totally wrong. You can see better Elton John performances on youtube. This product should be called "Using Elton John's Name to Rip You Off." There is nothing on this dvd worth buying.
Bought this to put on my teen's backpack. Keychain arrived and new out of the package the keychain links were broken. I fixed the links for him and within one day, one of the legs broke off. Not at all impressed with the quality. The full size light was great. Keychain not worth the $$! Gave it two stars, as the light itself is great.
I loved the first King Kong movie in black & white. But this movie was for me more enjoyable because of the special effects. The dinosaur fights were excellent. I loved the developement with King Kong as having a personality and the interaction between him and the girl. She even uses her vaudville act on Kong and he pretends to not be ammused but she wins him over eventually. Black is OK as the promoter of the adventure to find the mysterious island. He is a bit of a ham and overacts at times but that is his nature. He acts with the intensity of a Tom Cruise but just doesn't have quite Tom's magnetism. I would have given the movie 5 stars but they could have cut short the human eating giant insect scene in the chasm. The scene lasted over ten minutes (or seemed like it) and makes the movie out of reach of most children to enjoy. The old King Kong was accessable to all age groups something lost in this new one. However I still loved this movie.
I agree with some other reviews that the plastic honey bear & "Aunt Jemima" lights are bit ... uhhhh, cheesey; however, there is tons of other stuff that is very classy and it has great photos and interesting tidbits. Despite a few cheesetastiks, it's still WELL WORTH the price and a must-have for any fan of HALLOWEEN!!!
I have many top of the line cleaning rods and will always keep them around. BUT MOST OF THE TIME I USE BORESNAKES. They make cleaning so quick and easy. If you don't own one, go and buy one. I guarantee you will buy a Boresnake for every caliber you have.Downside is these are not cheap. But they are worth the money!Please note: On the .17 Caliber boresnake, there is no metal brush and this feature makes it handy to clean .22 barrels when you don't want to run an abrasive brush through the tube.
Power Rangers Operation Overdrive is the best series, in fact, all Power Rangers series are the best. Power Rangers Jungle Fury took me by surprise when the base of operations is a pizza parlor, because pizza is my favorite food. What also took me by surprise is an upcoming puprle ranger for the first in Power Rangers History. Purple have been my Favorite color, for as long as I can remember. I hope Jungle Fury will have 5 volumes that completed the entire series, just like Operation Overdrive.
Works just fine! Never have issue with Amazon and would recommend and buy again in future. Thank you.
As much as people slag the Stones' work in the 1980s, to me this is their worst album. It breaks down like this:1. Love Is Strong (9/10) Great opening song. A midtempo groove song with Mick purring seductively.2. You Got Me Rocking (9/10) Great rocker. It actually took a while to grow on me, but one of my favorites from the '90s.3. Sparks Will Fly (6/10) Decent rocker. Not too different from previous song, but not as good.4. The Worst (5/10) Strange place to put a country-ish Keith ballad. And at just over 2 minutes, it has a throwaway feel. Could've been really good if they'd developed it more.5. New Faces (4/10) Slow, spare song. Harpsichord immediately takes one back to '60s era, but nowhere near as good or memorable.6. Moon Is Up (5/10) Very strange, off-putting drum sound. Obviously trying out something different here. Vaguely psychedelic, but then harmonica comes in... it's interesting, but again sounds under-developed.7. Out Of Tears (6/10) Decent ballad, except that it sounds a little lifeless and at 5:30, is too long by at least a minute.8. I Go Wild (5/10) Midtempo rocker never really builds to anything.9. Brand New Car (5/10) Another midtempo song. It's silly (do we really need any more songs where cars=sexual innuendo?), but it does have a cool little groove.10. Sweethearts Together (4/10) Another slow song. This one can't decide whether to go the country route or not and ends up just sounding like an idea never fully developed. Another lifeless performance, too. Were they going for a breezy Jimmy Buffet sound?11. Suck On The Jugular (3/10) Another midtempo thing that goes nowhere fast. Really stupid, too. Just ends up in the repeated refrain of "all get together and feel all right." Total throwaway.12. Blinded By Rainbows (4/10) The harpsichord reappears for another ballad. The chorus is okay, but by this point in the album, it just drags.13. Baby Break It Down (5/10) Yet another midtempo song. Parts of it recall Exile-era. But the performance is lifeless and again, this just sounds undeveloped. Another could've been...14. Thru And Thru (3/10) Another Keith ballad. And at 6:00, it's too long. By this point in the album, is anyone still awake?15. Mean Disposition (4/10) Uptempo song that kind of harkens back to the '60s again. Not bad, but again, sounds tossed off and unfinished. After an hour of snooze... does it even matter?B-SIDES16. The Storm (5/10) Midtempo bluesy number. Not great, but better than most of the album tracks.17. So Young (5/10) Uptempo bluesy number. Again, not stellar, but has more life than most of the album.18. Jump On Top Of Me (5/10) Midtempo rocker. Not bad, not great.19. I'm Gonna Drive (5/10) Another midtempo rocker. Again, not great but better than most of the album.So, overall, more than any other album, this is a snoozer. Despite the good start, it quickly devolves into slow tempos and under-developed material. Most people consider Dirty Work to be their lowest point, but even that album keeps the tempo up and rocks some.Voodoo Lounge might have been salvaged if they'd cut 6 or 7 songs, replaced them with some of the b-sides and kept it a short 10 song/42 minute album. Unfortunately, this is just... the worst, to quote Keith.
I've been a huge fan of David and Leigh Eddings for much longer than Leigh has even been acknowledged to have participated in their writing. I've read and re-read the Belgariad, Mallorean, Elenium and Tamuli series more times than I can remember, and they always capture my interest anew. They are among my most favorite books and I can get lost in them over and over.That being said, however, The Elder Gods; the first in a projected four book series is so lame and tiresome that I've had to put it away for good. I've tried several times to find something in it that sparks an interest in continuing, but it's just not there. I can not grasp the plot, nor can I find a character to even care about. This book goes on the shelf and I'll not be investing in the remaining three.I hope that the series concludes very soon, and that the Eddings can get back on track with the solid writing of their early series.
An enjoyable historical novel, with vivid heros and villains. If you have an interest in the Roman Empire, this would be a good introduction. The book is well-written, with the material taken from credible historical sources, such as Tacitus, Suetonius, Plutarch, and Josephus.
una colonia sin mucho que decir, aroma se esfuma a las horas, no tiene cuerpo, no es un olor especial
Brock's book is compelling stuff; a searing indictment of the New Right written by someone who benefited from the machinations of the cabal. Brock serves up gripping look at the connections between politicians, pundits and questionable characters on the fringe of the "Get Clinton" movement. Don't think this is just a lot of fingerpointing. Brock is pretty hard on himself and the turnaround in his thinking feels genuine. I'm not surprised figures on the Right hate this book. It's a pretty damning portrait of egos and zeal, fueled by money, perceived power and running dangerously out of control.I wish Brock had included footnotes and an index. A book of this nature needs that sort of backbone to bolster the anecdotes. Granted, Ann Coulter included both footnotes and index in "Slander," which gave her critics (myself included) plenty of ammunition to explode the lies and misrepresentatons of that tome. Still, Brock leaves himself open to some criticism by not backing up his work with sources.
I love this pitcher. Good looking, easy to pour & clean. Soooo much better then any plastic pitcher I have ever owned. It is a bit pricey, which almost changed my mind about purchasing it, but I am more than happy with it.
This latest Laura Branigan compilation is a definite improvement over the last 1995 collection, restoring a few missing tracks and removing the bloat that kept that previous hits CD from rockin. Yes, it would have been nice to have Hold Me and All Night With Me included, as many have stated, but what greatest hits is without a gap or two? The important thing is the little word REMASTERED, never before used on a Laura hits CD, even the pretty cool European &quot;Very Best Of&quot; released in the early 90s. This one is a keeper, great for the curious as well as the hard core fans (who obviously own all her albums anyway). Pop it into the car stereo, pump the volume and get ready to cruise the night with the glorious voice of a true talent in your ears.
Son and his music-student roomate were thrilled with this system. Set up easily and quickly and had their music going and sounding great.
Season One is available on NetFlix in good quality.After researching I decided Amazon was the best place to get season two.I bought and downloaded (not streamed) the HD version but the quality is not that good. Just slightly better than DVD but nowhere near Blue Ray quality.I would be tempted to purchase Amazons annual movie subscription (like NetFlix) but if this is as good as the quality gets then I'll pass.If you are reading this then you already know Downton Abbey is awesome.
I recently purchased this book along with "Raw in Ten Minutes" by Brian Au, both of which will be sent back to Amazon soon.The recipes in this book are indeed quick but then again so is grabbing an apple or banana when your on the go. These recipes are about a step up from that. The chapters include salads, dips, soups, sauces and deserts. Nothing super substantial, appetizing or unique.This is a very small book and while it's only 11.95 the price is still too high for what you get.I would reccomend "Raw foods, Real World". The recipes are inspired, delicous and require no more time than these, just preperation. And I honestly dont think throwing something in a dehydrator and then walking away is that hard.
This is not the complete show.Very short DVD.Be aware of it before buying.I was extremelly disappointed, although the performacs are great, I felt deceived.
I was looking for a bag to carry my new SLR (Nikon D40X), yet didn't want the typical tote-look. I wanted something that I could take hiking or skiing or on a motorcycle ride, yet that wouldn't be as big as a normal backpack. This pack does the job, and is roomier than it looks. The modular partitions help to set up the inside just the way you want it, and the whole thing is well designed. Recommended!
Ok, ok, so there's no such word as 'quadrilogy' yet. Get over yourself, grammar boy. Who says it can't become a word? It makes logical sense, and besides, the word 'trekkies' is in the dictionary now! So SHUT UP AND BE HAPPY, JACKASS!*ahem* excuse me.... well the petitions, ramblings, letters, death threats, etc. toward Fox havefinally paid off, and we are finally seeing the ENTIRE series being presented with the respect it deserves. The first two were great, and the third one was ARTISTIC. Many of you who have either been in the marines or have been raised under a rock usually don't know what the 'art' concept is. Fincher made a great film, whether you Anti-3's want to believe it or not. This new version will finally present Alien 3 as it was meant to be shown, and hopefully it will gain more respect. I myself have seen a bootleg of the precut, and i must say, it puts to rest everything that was disliked about it. The inconsistancies, the plotholes, and the general lack of information presented in the theatrical version of Alien 3 are covered up. Some of this stuff i can't believe they cut in the first place.The special features given in this version should be astounding. I'm, of course, not going to review any of them yet because its not out. I pretty much only wanted to review the new Alien 3 and bash all those bitchy grammar school children out there.Laser disc stuff on Disc 9.... I've always wanted to see that footage....
It's full-flavored and sweet without being "fruit-y" (I don't add sweetener or anything other than hot water); a delicious way to take a 10 minute vacation. But, frankly, I'd say that about any yummy bagged tisane. I just mean: This blend is particularly tasty; the bags are a convenient and clean way to brew.I haven't noticed any "wellness" advantage in my own health, but my pal & co-worker discovered my stash and tried some. This determined "caff-head" is now drinking herbal! So you understand: Once I offered her a beverage with the sing-song inducement, "It's uncaffeinated"; to which she retorted, "Uncaffeinated! Do you even know me?"Not surprisingly, she's now a shade less belligerent in the PM (still needs her morning joe). Hey, now that I think about it, this means I DO have improved overall health as a result of "Tension Tamer Extra"; hosanna! Thanks Celestial Seasonings!
This book is one of my cookbook &quot;foundation&quot; books. Perfect for the cook who lacks confidence in the area of Italian cooking, but knows fabulous Italian food when s/he eats it. Lots of tips that push a dish from being &quot;good&quot; to &quot;fabulous&quot;. I use it at least once a week.
&quot;The Maker of Universes&quot; begins Philip Jose Farmer's &quot;The World of Tiers&quot; series of novels. &quot;The World of Tiers&quot; features a host of alternate universes, all &quot;next door&quot; to Earth and accessed through hidden gates, created and ruled by a decadent and technologically advanced race of Lords. This first novel opens with the Earthman Robert Wolff summoned to one of these parallel universes, to discover his Lordly heritage and to set right the evils of his world. Later installments introduce the human hero Kickaha and other members of Wolff's family. These books are fantasy yarns in the spirit of Edgar Rice Burroughs's John Carter of Mars adventures, and Farmer's Machiavellian family of Lords prefigures Corwin and relatives in Roger Zelazny's Amber chronicles. By comparison with these two siblings, &quot;The World of Tiers&quot; is certainly the runt of the litter. Farmer never fails to choose the trite cliche when confronted with a plot decision. The third novel in the series features the Lord Anana falling in love with the human Kickaha, overcome by his masculine charm, despite her &quot;murderous&quot; nature and previous disdain for lowly humans. No convincing argument for this transformation is presented, and it is clearly intended as a sop for Farmer's predominantly male audience. Similar teenage male pulp fiction conventions crowd the plot, never reworked artfully, and the action drags almost unbearably after several hundred pages. The story also suffers from an odd disjointedness; the characters in the novel periodically become possessed of vast knowledge concerning newly encountered races and cities, unbeknownst to the reader. A paragraph will suddenly contain a multitude of unintroduced terms and names with which the protagonist is intimately familiar, despite his complete ignorance of the landscape in the previous paragraph.Readers who enjoy this style of fiction might derive a few afternoons of enjoyment from Farmer's &quot;The World of Tiers.&quot; I'd much rather rejoin John Carter and the lovely Dejah Thoris on Barsoom, or travel with Corwin and Random through Shadow.
Finally, a good sequel. This book was a good read. If you read and liked Blinded, then you should really pick this one up. REAL TALK. It didn't dwell on Blinded's story. It was a whole new story with even some new characters. Like, Sweetie, the thievin bohemian. It also has more to the stories of the characters from the last book. Yall remember what Mona caught Kenny doing in Blinded. Not to mention her hot friend Nee. Ah yea, this book has some BUTTA to it. Go head Kashamba keep doing your thang. I'll support you.
This renditionof Hot Rod (also known as Rodimus) is one of the gems of the Transformers: Classics toyline.This toy is suprisingly solid in both forms and the attention to detail and quality is impressive. His car mode looks most like his G1 cartoon/movie version than any of the other Classics Transformers except perhaps Starscream.I especially like the way his gun turns into a jet engine (like the one on the Batmobile) for the rear of the car in car mode. One of the worst things about the original transformers was keeping track of their accessories, but with this latest line of toys the weapons are usually integrated into the vehicle mode somehow. This is one of the best examples of that integration.the only thing I could really find to nitpick about this toy is the lack of an Autobot symbol on the hood, but that isn't nearly enough to keep me from giving this toy 5 stars for its great transformation, solid feel and amazing poseability (especially compared to the original)
I'm a sci-fi fan and have seen all the alien movies yet made. This one is even worse then the previous one, Alien 3. It seems that after watching the first two alien films that the producers have run out of ideas. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is the only reason that people keep coming to see these films. Don't get me wrong, I like Alien and Aliens, but these films go way downhill in quality after the second film. It seems that they keep trying to bring Ripley back, eventhough she is killed in the third film. This movie series is like a nightmare that won't end. It starts out scary, but like all nightmares, it should end. Instead we are force fed more of these gruesome flicks like Jason and Freddy Kruger, Michael Miers, etc. Just end the damn series and get on with something else. Getting away from that analogy, I don't understand this preoccupation with english speaking accents. Why do all the actors except Ripley, have to speak with an english accent. It sounds so corney, since the first two movies have no- one with an accent. NO offense to english people intended! Other then that, this movie is a continuation of an old, overused plot, with little or no thrill like the first or second movies. I just don't find this movie scary, its just guts and gore something that would make you sick to your stomach, not scared. And like Alien 3, Alien Resurrection does not have anything in comon with Alien and Aliens, it just flat out sucks. Overall, not a good movie at all and defintely not worth wasting money on.
i cant believe this is a best seller. what a bomb. absolutley no substance on how to do anything just catch phrases. he advocates insider selling, desertion, and believes killing an unarmed boy in his helicopter is his sworn duty. im sickened that i bought this book. do your own research on this guy, need i say amway? also trashes his own dad and makes up this "rich dad", is divorced, no kids, and brags about his porche, rolex, and $400 golf clubs. its my guess that the source of his fortunes is from the sales of his books on how to get rich. ridiculous? you bet but dont say i didnt warn you. utter garbage. no substance.
It is two years since at the end of The Bourne Identity, we left the wholesome, good looking all-American boy turned former CIA assassin with amnesia Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) to live happily ever with his grunge hippie girlfriend Maria (Franka Potente of Run, Lola, Run fame) on a sunny Greek island.Maybe it was they wanted to escape the Olympics he could of won a swag of gold medals in, but Paul Greengrass's sequel The Bourne Supremacy opens with the couple living "off the radar" amongst the sunny beaches of Goa, India. Framed for the murder of a CIA case officer in Berlin, Bourne must leave this paradise not just to find out more about his past, but come to terms with how this knowledge affects the man he has become.You don't need to of seen The Bourne Identity to understand what is going on. Like with Bourne getting his memory back, you're given just enough information not to feel lost, but need to know more. The story revolves around the CIA investigation of a Russian oil tycoon, his possible involvement in the murder of a moderate Russian politician and the theft of a lot of CIA money. It all sounds as plausible as if it came from last week's newspaper.Damon's Jason Bourne is an interesting, sympathetic character placed into the middle of an already riveting story. He is a super spy who has paid for his talents by having no life. It is implied he and the other super agents of the "black on black" Project Treadstone were given their skills through the use of drugs, brainwashing and hypnotherapy with the side effect of turning them into potential psychopaths. The guilt and pain he feels as who ever he was before bleeds back into his personality is more brutal then any of the fight or action scenes.But yes, there are many of those and they are a joy to watch. Bourne fights and car chases his way through Goa, before heading off to Naples, Munich, Berlin and then finally Moscow. Greengrass knows how to do action scenes with a documentary style so like the story; they had at least some air of plausibility to them. Also, it is interesting to see these cities at the street level. Around the action people are going about their daily lives in a studied detail the camera doesn't just whiz by.As a spy film this is worth seeing. As a film exploring how a man will work through the guilt he feels over a life he barely remembers, it is really worth taking a look.
I would recommend this audio novel to all who enjoy a love story as well as historical background. Reading the book of Esther first is a plus but anyone can get the point of the story just by listening to it. For Christians this is a must "read." Tommy Tenney did a really good job in portraying the story of God's love for His people and for the world.
Loved it!!! This book deserves a 4.5 star rating.In my life I have learned that we become a product of our experiences, good or bad. Our choices, based on those experiences, either make us stronger or weaker. It is up to us. I loved this story because it was an illustration of how one woman chose to become stronger because of her experiences.Personally, my pioneer ancestors were settling in New Mexico during the same time period. The women of my family had the same grit as Sarah. You couldn't survive well in the west without it. Reading of Sarah's experiences actually gave me greater admiration for the women in my family and what they went through.This is how I like my historical fiction. It had a little bit of everything. Was it a polished, free- flowing novel? Of course not, it wasn't supposed to be. Journal entries are not usually impeccably refined. At least mine aren't. The author's choice to write in this manner retained the raw, untamed experiences of the West. The difficulties were not sugar-coated, and at times they were not politically correct. When has there ever been a point in human history when people have been free of prejudices? Never! I hate when the true aspects of human nature are eliminated in order to avoid offending. That is not done here. Every character in this story had flaws. It is only when we admit to our flaws that we have a chance to improve them.The author truly brought this story to life for me. There were moments when I literally held my breath, moments my heart raced with fear, moments I laughed out loud, moments I wanted to shake a character and say, "What's wrong with you," and moments I couldn't hold back the tears. The ending I could see coming from a mile away. Sometimes life is like that. I'm glad the author didn't feel she had stick with the "Happily Ever After" endings that are so prevalent. No one's life is really like that. I suppose that is why we write them. I'm not saying we don't have happy moments--even happy seasons, but we wouldn't experience growth without challenges.To me, this novel is very authentic. I will definitely be adding it to my library.
The main thing I came away with from this twofer is that Anthony Warlow is the most versitile actor singing Gilbert & Sullivan today. On one hand, he is superb as "Pinafore"'s handsome Captain Corcoran, and grotesquely funny as the half-senile judge in "Trail by Jury".H.M.S.Pinafore - The setting is slightly "updated" to make the Pinafore appear a contemporary of the Titanic. It is well sung, and on the whole well done, and perhaps I am being picky, but I have seen better. Admittedly, it is not easy to find a middle ground between romantic comedy, social satire, and a contrived, uncomfortable ending that for me has always been more worthy of Monty Python than Gilbert & Sullivan. Balancing these elements is never comfortable, and this is yet another well-staged version that doesn't quite do it.Trial by Jury - on the other hand, I wildly applaud this droll and unique production that has had it coming for years. After all, why would half of London concern themselves over an engagement breakup if it were not involving high-profile personalities referred to only by their first names? In this version, Edwin and Angelina are obviously socialites and celebrities, instantly recognizable to all, especially a Paris Hilton-like Angelina (even though we are told that Edwin is the one with all the money). In this modern setting, the little quaint Victorian comedy comes wonderfully to life in ways that we can all recognize and laugh at. In many ways, "Trail by Jury" is the most timely G&S; of all, and in this version, looks as if it popped right off the pages of London tabloids - or from the screen of a BBC comedy. Fantastic.
This book is used by people who teach sign language and that is how we came to find out about it and why we purchased it. Graphic and easy to follow.
My town requires that we put all our garden/yard debris in clear, plastic recycling bags. I used to buy these at my local grocery store, until they closed.So, I am very glad I can now buy them here. These are the best for yardwork because of the built in handles that tie so well. I hate having to keep separate tie clasps with bags! And, they are somewhat durable also for general yard debris, leaves, etc.
I can agree with reviewers who noted that this kettle looks great--it does. But form without function is pointless, at least when it comes to cookware. This kettle can't get up enough steam to blow it's own whistle, and the all around construction is shoddy. After only a few months, the seam that runs up the spout began to split open; after less than a year, rust had begun to corrode the inside.I own an entire set of all-clad cookware, which I love. My husband bought this kettle as a Valentine's gift, to replace the $6.99 Farberware model we'd gotten at target a few years earlier. When the kettle didn't whistle, I just assumed we had a faulty whistle and figured I'd find another for it, or contact the manufacturer. A few months later, I read all these horrid reviews on Amazon and elswhere and realized that we'd bought a lemon. The box, receipt, etc were long gone, and I've been stuck with this pretty but fairly pointless kettle ever since. For a hundred bucks, I thought I'd at least be able to boil water.I see that another reviewer noted that she got a replacement from All-Clad. I'm going to contact the manufacturer and see if they're willing to replace mine; if they are, I'll amend this review. But for now, I have to say thumbs down.
With military stories, good character development, and a non-stop plot, there's not much more one could ask. It's a fun book I'll look forward to re-reading in a couple years.
I bet I've watched this movie 20 times over the last 10 years between my old VHS copy and later Diamond Entertainment DVD version. I can't explain why, but I love this movie. It's the perfect lay in bed and doze-off-to movie. My recommendation: skip the Diamond fullscreen DVD version (which doesn't have any better quality than VHS tape) and go for the Image version. The only advantage the Diamond DVD has is that it's a double feature with &quot;Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet&quot;, an almost decent dozer. I won't go into the plot or details since other reviews have. I can only say that this is an entirely enjoyable movie for classic sci-fi fans.
This film has some of the worst acting i've ever seen. The movie has a good story line but it;s hard to watch with this terrible acting. DONT BUY THIS, you will only watch it once. Hire it out.
What do you do when you've completed a text of basic Latin grammar, but aren't ready yet for Cicero? For me, FAIRY TALES IN LATIN is a great solution:1. I know the stories so well, they almost tell themselves.2. I found myself breezing through grammar that gave me grief when I was learning it. I read right through the subjunctive, conditionals, and more without even realizing it!3. The writers put to good use the repetition common to fairy tales by using different voices and vocabulary.4. While you'll probably never again see a few of the new vocabulary (did the ancient Romans eat porridge?), there's *plenty* that you will.Word order is more English than Latin. But at this stage of the game, I think that's a good thing. The experts may hold a different opinion.All I know is that this book has solidified my ability to read selections that include many areas of grammar, and has expanded my vocabulary.There are no macrons in either the stories themselves or the glossary. Don't panic! It becomes easy fast. Hey, we'll have to face de-macroned Latin sometime :-)I just love that, with only a little effort, I can read through these stories. In Latin! Get this book.
My daughter is a total Care Bear fanatic. We first rented this movie for her and she absolutely loved it! She wanted to watch it over and over again! Definitely a must have!
This cd as some have conceded in their reviews came at a wrong time for this band and therefore failed to catch the attention of the radio stations. This music is inspiring to listen to when driving..feeling melancholic or just feeling upbeat..it is music for ALL occasions. But the cd whilst you can before it is deleted..believe me you wont regret it ONE bit!!
Absolutely the best game I have ever played! that being said I have been a fan of Metal Gear Solid since the PS1 release. Yes at times the videos do drag on little, but if you are a Metal Gear fan you will enjoy! I have approximately 20 ps3 games and this is the only one that I wish to play over and over again! Now if you don't like games with long cinematic s, metal gear solid games, stealth games or are only a fan FPS fan YOU WILL NOT ENJOY THIS GAME! But if you are like me this will be the best game you have ever played!
Having been to Oaxaca approximately ten times in the past 20 years, I can appreciate the quality and beauty of this fine book. The reasonable price of this &quot;paperback&quot; belies its perfect format/size and its gorgeous photography, text and printing quality.I've rarely been satisfied with &quot;crafts&quot; books, but this one has been so perfectly written and executed, that it makes me want to jump on a plane and immediately fly to Oaxaca, to find and meet the fantastic artists presented here.I met one of these women several years ago (Angelica Vasquez), and this glorious book will create an urge in many of its readers to meet her and the other artists that are included here.
I have read eleven books by Silva and can say that he is one of my favorite authors. But this fifth novel in the Allon series seemed to be lacking the usual suspenseful thrill that I have come to enjoy so much. That being said, it was well written and weaves Middle-East current events into the prose exceptionally well. Also it gives a factual history from the early 1900s to the present time on the struggles between the Palestinians and the Israelis. The complexities are shown through both the eyes of Gabriel and the eyes of Fellah al-Tamari, one of his Palestinian enemies. A balanced perspective.A recent horrific bomb at the Israeli embassy in Rome has left fifty-two dead - in one of the terrorist's house the Mossad discovers a complete dossier on Gabriel Allon, including his true identity, his bloody past, and have marked him for termination - the master villain has laid a trap for Gabriel that will . . .Wow, what a short and quick ending! But it did tie up all the loose ends very nicely. Except it may have left the daughter of the master villain for another time?Author al-Qaeda Strikes Again
What more can be said about this extraordinary work? It truly has everything--the universal American themes of success and money, finely drawn characters, perhaps the most doomed love story ever written, and finally, a bitterly tragic ending.I first read this book over 30 years ago at a time when I was first discovering Fitzgerald's genius. However, I have since found myself coming back to it again and again. The mood Fitzgerald's words generate is like nothing else I've ever experienced in literature, with the possible exception of the writings of Isak Dinesen.In &quot;Gatsby&quot;, a sense of impending doom seems to loom over the entire story. Here you have a hero whose only goal in life is winning the love of a boundlessly shallow and self-centered woman who can never be worthy of his affections. Daisy's persona, combined with the world of money and carelessness that has produced her and her kind, can only lead to tragedy for Gatsby.A masterpiece ...
There's something for everyone on this CD. Beautiful ballads, hot dance-songss, Latin songs and R 'n B songs.If you had my love: Her first single is a mix of R n'B and Pop. By far not the best song on the album.Should've never: This is a ballad. Very romantic and dreamy. Even though it's very long it's not boring at allToo late: Latin-Fans will love this songFeelin' so good: With Big pun and Fat joe. It's a nice party song. It lets me think of a summer partyLet's get loud: ...With a great dancebeat. ...Could this be love. This is a ballad. One of the best songs on the albumNo me ames (Tropical remix): A Duet with Marc Anthony. This is the up-tempo-version. The slower version is betterWaiting for tonight: This is the ultimate Dance-song by Jennifer Lopez. I love the sound.open off my love: Another Latin song. it sounds very erotic.Promise me You'll try. Another beautiful balladit's not that serious: Again a Latin-SongTalk about us: This ballad is a little bit schmalzy. ...no me ames (Ballad version). The slow version. That's how it is got to be.Una noche mas. "Waiting for tonight" in Spanish.The last two songs are bonustracks:Baila. This is the fastest song on the whole CD. At first I didn't like it but it grew on me. it kinda sounds like "Let's get loud" but not as goodTheme from Mahogany (Do you know where you're going to)This is again a ballad. i was very surprised when i heard it because Mariah Carey sings it on her #1's Album but Jennifers version is better - without a doubt. It sounds like it is written for her voice. She sounds wonderful, although her voice is not as good as Mariah's BRAVO
there is a difference between this cleanser and the "neutrogena deep clean foaming cleanser" (if i remember the name correctly) that looks almost exactly identical to this one except for that one word.i love this cream cleanser--i like the feel of it (it stays put on your face almost like a mask but rinses off easily), it does a great job cleansing my face without drying it out, and it lasts a long time (you only need to use a tiny bit each time). i've got normal skin, but would also recommend it to people with oily skin (just use more than the dime size drop that i use).
I read this book after seeing the movie from Blockbuster.It's such an interesting, moving story. It takes you into a completely different culture - Very interesting and sad.
I'm sorry I may be the minority who preferred the 70s version, maybe I'm getting old and sentimental. To me, the singing seems jarring and over acting, especially &quot;see my tongue I can hardly talk&quot;, and the Gothic makeup weren't to my liking. And a blue-eyed Jesus ? I know this is acting, but at least infuse some reality for believers of the Christian faith. Thanks.
I've followed Sevendust since their debut self-titled album was released; and unlike most bands that emphasize one sound, Sevendust have broken the mold and created a sound that is truly their own. The band has matured considerably over the course of 3 albums, and &quot;Animosity&quot; is truly their crowning achievement. Every song shows remarkable craftsmanship and soul, and Lajon's voice is finally brought to the front, and has never sounded better! The big plus here, is that Sevendust finally had to time to really create and craft this record, as opposed to the other 2, which are both good in their own respects, but were written and recorded in short amounts of time. Sevendust's ability to write great heavy songs like &quot;T.O.A.B.&quot;, &quot;Dead Set&quot;, and the smashing first single &quot;Praise&quot; shows that the band has not lost its edge over the years. However, the songs that showcase Lajon's voice and Sevendust's maturity can truly be heard on the excellent tracks &quot;Xmas Day&quot;, &quot;Follow&quot; with Aaron Lewis of Staind, and the incredibly reworked version of &quot;Angel's Son&quot;, a tribute to Snot frontman Lynn Strait. Sevendust has truly come into their own with this album. While getting a solid 5 stars, this album should finally push them to the forefront of the pack, as they are truly a step above the rest.
I see a lot of comparisons to CSI, but let's face it - Quincy is not that. CSI is an entertaining show, but it's filled with two-dimensional men with bulging muscles, women with low-cut blouses, and labs that are lit with dramatic lighting & lots of pretty decorations. When was the last time you walked into a lab that looks like that?!?!? In a word, CSI is T&A; and pretty sets - Shallow.Quincy is all heart.Quincy works in a boring, sterile, white-colored laboratory that is dull in appearance, but Jack Klugman pours his heart into the character and makes the show exciting. As Quincy says to a bunch of college students, "You may not have any interest in forensics, but I do, and I am passionate about my work. If you have no interest in this class, leave now so I can go back to doing what I love." Quincy loves solving the mystery, loves overcoming obstacles, and loves catching the bad guy.Passion. Dedication. Morality. That's what sets Quincy above the CSI clones and made it one of the most successful series on television (8 years worth of episodes). Don't mistake this for CSI - Quincy is better than that.
It's a joke. There is some information covered but it is not well organized. It's just some dork who wants to act like he's a heavy metal, devil worshipping, wanna be.The "actor" could have been a mannequin; he sat still on his "throne" with his stupid hood pulled down over his face and just talked.
A lot of people are complaining that Bumblebee is no longer a VW Bug. Hasbro has liscencing reasons why they chose not to use that car, but at the same time they could have chosen not to re-release this character as a new, highly poseable toy too, so don't complain too loudly...Anyway, yes this car no longer looks like a Bug, but having said that, the original toy was a lot smaller and didn't actually look like the cartoon character either. This version of the toy is very well made and the headsculpt is nearly a perfect match for what we all saw in the original cartoons. He has door shields, just like the new Optimus, but in Bumblebees case I feel that they were better done, since Optimus's kind of flop around when you move his arms. Bumblebees do not. They lock into place and are very solidly stuck to his arms in robot mode.My few complaints, and the reasons I didn't give this toy 5 stars is that instead of a fun, he comes with a silly "waverunner on a trailer." I don't know whose idea this was, but the trailer/waverunner really feel like an afterthought for the toy. More like a "gee this toy needs an accessory" type of addition than something really thought through. The quality of the plastic and paint in the wave runner is not in the same class as the quality of the Bumblebee figure and the area where it hooks onto the car just look awkward overall. Like someone else mentioned he really should have just come with a gun.My second complaint is his "knees" which are formed by the two front seats inside the car. It is really great that the car has front seats as that adds an additional detail which makes the vehicle mode look great. However the flaps above the feet on my toy tend to get caught under the seats when posing, making it occasionally irratating to move the legs and making me worry I might chip the paint of the leg or the seat. Its a minor thing but it coulda been fixed by just making the seat slightly shorter.All in all I am very happy with this toy, its a great addition and puts the original Bumblebee to shame.
for holding the "cable box" directly below my small, wall-mounted flat screen TV. Easy to install
Definitely a movie a viewer must watch at least 2 times to remember crucial important clues and relevant names to the plot. Quetin Tarantino style of direction. Time corresponded with main character's memory loss of the tragedy of his wife and himself. The brutal incident that occured in his home caused physical damage to his brain that would affect short term memory, OR DID IT? Sammy Jankis had similar problems with short term memory like Lenny. Leonard, the main character, was an insurance investigator who found that his memory loss was attributed to mental health instead of physical trauma. Leonard was mentally disadvantaged and others tried to take advantage of him for their own personal reasons. Very unique story line and direction. First film I have ever seen that focused on memory as being the most crucial element in uncovering the plot. The viewer will see small clues as the film advances and you will return to those same clues with more information to link the puzzle together. Incidents that occur don't chronologically follow in standard format. The movie begins with the ending. You will see random events that will link all together the further you watch this movie. It will make so much more sense near the end. It is a very compelling film that will keep you watching. It never gets boring. Scenes are very quick and if you turn your head or get up, you will miss vital parts. Pay attention to names. This will help you with association with the main character. Movie is executed very well with dialogue, acting, and time references. This movie can be seen by 10 different intelligent people and you could possibly end up with ten different opinions on it. Don't be surprised. The director wanted to leave it ambiguous for interpretation by the viewer. My philosophy is: The story is about a man who revenges his wife's death, realizing his own guilt, suppressing it with very strong denial. He is physically fine but his mental inner demons will not allow himself to accept the truth. Thereby, short term memory loss helps him cope with his profound loss of a loved one. All the characters seem like liars and it is hard to distinguish who might be telling the truth. Very clever editing and the relapses in time are exact with real time. You must watch the entire movie from front to finish to complete this puzzle. Very intelligent film making and direction with a strong supporting cast. My only complaint is that the film never clears up why and how certain character evolve into the story line. If this part was not so vague and more definite then it would receive 5 stars. Otherwise, a very interesting movie that forces the viewer to use his senses, attention, and problem solving ability. If you are an intelligent movie watcher that wants more than your typical and predictable script, then this is the movie for you. Memento will cause use to question with uncertainty on what you think you saw. This movie is a great discussion piece for philosophy and interpretation.
1919,Lulu Belle(Dorothy Lamour)a big time singing star and her husband to be,Harry Randolph(Otto Kruger)a rich tycoon,are shot by an unknown killer.The police round up a number of suspects,George Davis(George Montgomery)an excon who had been in love with Lulu.Mark Brady(Albert Dekker)once a big time gambler,now a down and out nightclub owner who needed Lulu to get his club back in order,but Lulu refused.Gloria(Charlotte Wynters)Randolphs ex wife,Lulus best friend(Glenda Farrell),and Butch Cooper(Greg McClure)an ex big time boxer,now a cripple who lost an eye in a barroom fight over Lulu.Who could the shooter be?Why not find out?
I really liked this book. It was raw and that is what it takes to truly tell this story. There is no other way to get around the harsh reality of Ms. Sebold's excruciating forcible violation. I would recommend this read with the understanding that it is graphic and it is awful but it is TRUE! Ms. Sebold is a remarkable person to withstand this tragedy, but I know it took her awhile to understand that herself. God bless!
Can you believe this film was directed by Wes Craven? What a moving story! Everyone should see this movie. One thing-why is Gloria Estefan on the cover???!! Don't get me wrong I love her music, but she hardly had any part AT ALL! Maybe she had 7 lines in all, so it kind of doesn't make sense. Anyway, this movie is great-so watch it, NOW! :-)
Terrific western series with Robert Fuller & John Smith. The service was good but the last 3 shows of the series was all broken up....poor quality.
I liked the early Kay Scarpetta novels for the forensic science, but the real "victim" in every novel is Kay Scarpetta (Cornwell's alter ego) herself. Her career is in jeopardy, her credibility, her niece's life, her own life...The poor ripped-up murder victims are as nothing to Scarpetta's problems.Typically, "Portrait of a Killer" begins with the angst of its author. "It has always been easier for me to get angry than to show fear or loss, and I was losing my life to Walter Richard Sickert." A simple invitation to visit Scotland Yard is fraught with moral ramifications: "It would have been a betrayal of what I am and an insult to Scotland Yard and every law enforcer in Christendom for me to be 'tired' the day Linda Fairstein said she could arrange a tour." Her self-absorption is almost comical.Cornwell makes no argument that comes close to justifying her conviction that Sickert was the Ripper. She seems to have formed her opinion of Sickert's guilt based on his art ("I saw evil"), then examined his life for facts to justify that opinion. Her presentation is poor: Facts about the murders, cultural history of the Victorian era, art criticism, and descriptions of modern forensic science are presented in a random jumble. Her own assumptions contradict themselves; after telling us that Sickert preferred his victims ugly and deformed, she offers no word of explanation as to why the Ripper's most grisly murder was of the young attractive Mary Kelly.I have no theory as to who the Ripper was; he may even have been Walter Sickert, but certainly not based on this compilation of "evidence"!
From Nixon on is sheer genius indeed, though I also like the earlier albums. Best lyrics around, and a beautiful mix of instruments. I never tire of Lambchop.
Melanie Phillips' diagnosis of the problems facing Britain is spot-on. As much as she ridicules the Islamic radicals who inspire and carry out terrorist attacks, self-imposed segregation, and subversion of the traditional British ethos, she goes after the Leftist and multiculturalist enablers of said Islamic radicals. The infiltration of all institutions, including the police, schools, the Anglican Church, and even the royal family, by these types is the reason radical Islam is a problem at all in Britain. They are unable to identify the problem of jihadism at its core, and thus they believe appeasement of the Muslim community's "grievances," including support of the war against the totalitarian murderer and sponsor of worldwide terror Saddam Hussein, and support for the sole beacon of democracy and freedom in the Middle East, Israel, will pacify the militants among them. It won't.Britain's loss of confidence in its values mid-20th century and subsequent subscription to relativism lie at the core of Britain's problems. As morals are removed from the public sphere, there is no societal fabric for Muslim immigrants to assimilate in. Thus a void is left that is slowly being filled with Islamic values.Many people who love this book love it because it states clearly what they already believe; they just didn't know how to put it. New to me was Phillips' analysis of human rights law and how it is being manipulated in Britain, particularly by judges, to the detriment of the majority culture and its values.The arguments and examples Phillips provides are legion, and I think to the detriment of the book. Some examples, arguments, and formulations are repeated. No big deal. Repetition is the mother of learning. I could have done without much of the chapter about the Anglican Church's theological disputes with Judaism. This seemed to me the weakest part of the book. Maybe it's because I find theology to be impossible to debate. But for those who find it otherwise, they will find this chapter is particularly enlightening.
I have a closet full of cookbooks that rarely are used but for the holidays I pulled out all my French food cookbooks to make special dinners. The others didn't work out too well, but this book is filled with excellent recipes that really worked for me! The Salmon with Lentils is excellent! I used other recipes too, but the Very Best One (I think) is the chocolate mousse! It was so good, so easy to follow and impressed my guests. Thanks to my daughter-in-law Marie for giving me this wonderful book.
Author Shawna Delacorte returns for her third Intrigue with "In His Safekeeping," a muddled tale that fails to engage. Tara Ford has tried to get on with her life after testifying against her former boss. Then U.S. Marshal Brad Harrison comes to tell her that the other five witnesses in the trial have all been killed. She's the only one left. Brad vows to protect her. Can he resist his attraction to the vulnerable beauty long enough to figure out who is after her?"In His Safekeeping" was an acceptable read. It wasn't a terrible book. It wasn't a good one either. The beginning is awkward and I had trouble getting into the story. This is another book where the characters feel an instant attraction and immediately begin fixating on the other person's body. Sometimes it can work. Here it felt too forced and unbelievable. The author tells us they are attracted to each other instead of showing it or making me feel it. Tara is also a very weak heroine, both foolish and nave. Some of the information she withholds from Brad because she doesn't think it is relevant is so obvious I had to shake my head in disbelief. The setup is also slightly unbelievable and the story is occasionally hard to follow.On the plus side, "In His Safekeeping" improves on the fatal flaw of Delacorte's last Intrigue, "Secret Lover," where so much time was spent on the secondary characters that the hero and heroine weren't a big part of the story. Here the focus is mainly on Tara and Brad. Delacorte does a reasonably good job keeping the suspects balanced so any one of them could be the guilty party. "In His Safekeeping" is an okay book, but not one I can recommend.
As a fan of Lileks' "Regrettable Food" volume, I bought this only to be greatly disappointed -- it's just not funny enough. Rather than let the vintage material speak for itself, the author feels compelled to make sarcastic comments which are not very clever or entertaining. Many of the reproductions of the vintage material are small and hard to read, and there simply aren't enough good ones to justify this as a full book. It would have been better for the author to have culled only the best and most outrageous of these items and used it as a chapter in some other book. Therefore, I simply cannot recommend this one.
The photo does not really do this pan justice. Wilton has been a leader in cake equipment for as long as I can remember. I bought this pan originally because it was listed as being 2 1//2 inches deep (it's not -it's 2 - I was looking for a lasagna pan.) I was so intrigued with the quality that I decided to keep the pan. It's a sturdy metal with a sleek, non-stick coating on all surfaces. If a pan can be attractive, Wilton did it! The lid fits pretty well - the sides slid over the handles to lock it in place. I baked a cake in it and it's the best non-stick I have ever used. I have an AirBake pan that used to be my favorite - I think this pan will be taking it's place!
I loved Lost. But then this season absolutely killed it all. Not just the ending, the entire saga. All previous 5 seasons are now pointless or maybe better explained as "null-and-void" by this season. Like looking back on a relationship that went south and wishing you could have just avoided the whole thing, that is what season 6 does to what was a great story. I am so glad I never bought the previous seasons because this season makes everything, EVERYTHING, that happened in the previous seasons pointless. I was sad when Cheers ended, sad again when Friends ended, and sorry to see Ally McBeal go too. This was the first ending to a show that left me mad. By the first few episodes I was already frustrated at all the "new stuff" they were adding but still I could not bring myself to believe the guys who created this wonderful story would fail so enormously in the ending. But I was wrong and this season was so bad that I can't believe it was written by the same guys.So not only would I not buy this on Blu-Ray or DVD, I wouldn't buy the previous seasons now (which I had planned on once it was all over). If you need to, rent it to finish the story for yourself, but don't waste more of your money buying this. You'll thank me later.
The 80s gave us more than its share of truely awful music. As this wave of crap started to wash over us, John Entwistle released Too Late the Hero. It is clearly a product of it's time, but unlike the rest of the music of the time, John's music snaps and pops with sharp lyrics and great playing. Joe Walsh handles guitars and shows why he is among the best in the business with tight, business like playing. An enjoyable treat is the bass/guitar duel in Dancin' Master. The title track again shows that John was a few steps ahead of his contemporaries. The song sounds as if Genesis should have recorded it, minus the Genesis suck factor. There's the sadly prophetic Love is a Heart Attack that has rif that Tool would proudly call their own. The album isn't a stand out like Smash Your Head Against a Wall or Whistle Rymes, but a good and throughly enjoyable listen.
I read a third of this book. Got bored. Put it down.There's nothing unique or new in his message and the book is redundant.Good Christian books are:The Life Application Bible - Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John."The Case for Christ" and "The Case for Faith" are excellent.Also "Mere Christianity" by C.S. Lewis is a little harder read but an excellent book.
I think this movie was played out along time ago but to go and make the first episode was a waste of time and money. I think that the other star wars episodes were fine and then they have to go along and make a new one. This movie has been played out to many times
As a devout Potter head, I am sad to say that this movie was pretty bad. The only reason I bought it was b/c I want to own the entire series.In sum, nothing happens in this movie, the events are not even close to events in the book, and don't get me started on the important aspects which were left out. Don't purchase unless you need to own the entire series.
I've always been interested in German history, particularly the most eventful, tumultuous, and tragic period between 1918 and 1945. In the western world, the question so often is, "how could it happen," with the implied clauses of "in modern world," "in the civilized west," and so on. I must admit that though I've read some good analyses of the Weimar period, I've never found a satisfactory answer to this important question. Mayer provides one, and his answer is incredible in its simplicity and common sense.The brilliance of this book can best be summed up with the familiar platitude, "don't tell me, show me." Mayer doesn't describe the mood of the Germans, the feel of the time or the period, or what have you. Like any good interviewer, he gets out of the way and lets the Germans tell their own story. By him doing so, the reader gets to see history through the eyes of the Germans, the way saw it (or the way they remember it), though poignant (even ironically humorous) anecdotes.As for the answer to the question above, the answer is best summed up by one of Mayer's chapter titles, "What Would You Have Done?" So often we are blinded by the horror and enormity of the Holocaust that we forget the Germans too were ordinary men living ordinary lives. The tendency of the historian is to focus on the events of history that seem most important in hindsight, but lost is the consideration of how important these events were in the lives of the actors at the time.As one example of many, Mayer discusses the night after Kristalnact, the burning of hundreds of German synagogues on November 9, 1938. How did the ten Nazis in his sample feel about this event? Were they glad? A few were (one actually led it in his town). Were they disgusted? Many were. Could they do anything about it? None could, so nothing was done. The next morning, all following orders of direct superiors, the police in the town gathered up all of the Jewish men, who were then sent away "for their own protection," presumably because they were in danger after the synagogue burnings. Only a couple of the ten sample Nazis knew a Jew. What were they to do?And I may tangentially add that this should be familiar to us in America. We hear about bombing of civilians, or unlawful detainment, or abuse of prisoners, or violation of civil rights. What do we think? "Outrageous! Attrocious! Egregious!" What do we say? "It can't be helped," or "It's a necessary evil," or "I can't stop it." What do we do? Nothing, because of course we're right about the last statement. The lives of the Germans should be eminently relatable to the average American, if he'll admit it to himself.Back to the book, aside from the interviews with the Nazis, the second part, which consists of analytical essays of the German character, and how it was shaped in modern history. The analysis is good and insightful, and answers a lot of questions, not about the Germans having a culture of obedience, for indeed any course second-rate historian can make such a statement, as many have, but WHY the Germans have a culture of obedience, and how it developed over time and under what conditions.All in all, the book is excellent, full of excellent analysis and original points, and it answers many crucial questions that are not answered to satisfaction elsewhere. I highly recommend this.
My wife, the loving mother of my children and a deeply, truly compassionate human being had the following to say after watching "Meet the Parents":"The only thing I liked about it was that it ended!""I chewed my fingers all movie long waiting for someone to kill Ben Stiller!""I hope that Ben Stiller burns in hell."Clearly, she didn't enjoy this picture.
I pre-ordered this movie using the 2 day option for the same day release, meaning I would get the movie ON the day it was released, but this was not the case, AMAZON sent the movie MONDAY (the week it was to be released) and I didn't get the movie until WEDNESDAY even though the website said order using 2 day shipping and get it when it is released. THAT WAS NOT THE CASE. I spoke to several amazon.com customer support staffs and NONE of them would say they did wrong, nor did anything to set things right. I spoke to 3 different people and they all said my item was out for delivery, with the UPS tracking I noticed it was NOT out for delivery and I even mentioned that to every single person, they all assured me it was. I normally have a GREAT experience with amazon but this one item and the sucky service I received from the support center REALLY has frustrated me. Now for the movie, I liked it better than the first one. MUCH more action, and kept my ADHD kid's attention the entire time.
This has got to be one of the best animated films I've seen recently, along withPersepolis. The black and white (no gray) visuals are extremely intriguing. You also get an engaging, if not entirely original, storyline.The animation style is in the Western mold, rather than Japanese anime. The style is a mix ofA Scanner Darklyfor the movements and Sin City, for the reliance on black and white only. Also similar to Persepolis, palette-wise. But it really has a style all its own. Its closest relatives are inkpen line drawings you see in architecture projects and some artists, but those are static media.The rendition of Paris' architecture in 2050 is amazing, especially if you know the city. I do think that they are better when they focus on existing Paris landscapes, rather than creating huge futuristic buildings.Subway stations are especially well rendered in loving details. You can tell the director aimed to make the most of the visual compositions possible with this particular animation technology: combat scenes, chameleon suits, snow and rain, frames within frames, whiteout vs. blackout. This is a movie with much visual re-watch value.The bleak, paranoid world it depicts reminds one of Blade Runner andEquilibrium(a seriously underrated movie). But the prize is the animation, rather than the storyline.
This is a gem of a movie. It's all madness &amp; mayhem on the surface, and warm &amp; cozy underneath. Like most of Frank Capra's movies, this is a morality play. The filmaker continues his favorite theme, downplaying the materalistic and embracing the things that really matter, love, both romantic &amp; platonic, friends &amp; family. This type of material might be a preachy bore in the hands of a person less skilled than Frank Capra, but he makes it work. Not only does it work, but the movie is hilarious. The cast is excellent, starring Lionel Barrymore, I would say at his best, but I never saw anything he was in where he wasn't great. Jimmy Stewart plays one of his nice guys here to the max &amp; is terrific also. The rest of the cast is excellent as well. I especially loved the &quot;mad Russian&quot; played by Mischa Auer. Eddie Anderson steals every scene he's in whether he's speaking or not.All in all, it's a fine ensemble cast, everyone is very good. Do yourself a favor, if you have an opportunity to see this, please do!
Great GPS unit for travel and confined spaces. This is a solid Garmin product that does as advertised. Routing and directions are clear and precise. Works well on a motorcycle with a small windshield or dashboard. Will not take up much space. About the size of a baseball. Suction cup works really well and can be hard to remove at times. Would give this a 5 if it had a color display. I own the i3 version of this as well and would give it a 5 rating if I had bought it here. This model can be found cheaper and works well if you want basic features. Get rid of the 128 Mb card, get a 1Gb card and load all of North America on it. (The OD green color may put some people off, but it works well with a darker interior or if you use it in a military HMMWV, it feels right at home. On that note, the monochrome grayscale screen is night vision compatible too.) Great little unit to have with you. AA batteries can be found anywhere and the only real downfall is the power cord does not recharge the batteries. The unit does not have a recharging circuit in it.
I read the first two books in this series in one day...was left craving more content as they are both rather slim novels. That's the only reason I gave 4 stars.
Very predictable for adults but a great movie for kids. Very classical theme of believing in Christmas, Santa, etc... Strong characters make this movie a bit different from others. I recommend it to all parents.
If you got the time, then it's sublime. To really enjoy these tracks, just sit down with some GOOD headphones and immerse yourself in the band. What a trip. True psychedelic acid rock at its finest. Remember those days? (If you do, you weren't there) Buy this. For you youngsters out there (anyone under 45) this is a good educational set for you as well.
BAM! Ms. Rule is back at us with a tight, suspenseful, white-knuckler tale that proves that truth is, indeed, stranger than fiction.Fans who were concerned about Ms. Rule's adequate, yet less exhilirating recent works will find that they are solidly back in Ms. Rule's court once again after they finish this fascinating story.Ms. Rule wrote this book on the request of the victim Sheila Bellush, who told her family to find Ms. Rule and beg her to write the tale of Sheila's life and death should she be murdered by her ex-husband, the abuser Allen Van Houte.Multi-millionaire Allen Van Houte is a classic sociopath; so skilled at wearing his &quot;mask&quot; that everyone who knows him thinks he's the epitome of a &quot;real nice guy.&quot; However, in reality, he is a swindler, con man, domestic violence abuser, sexual molester of children, and finally a murderer. Ms. Rule's clever pen brings his true personality into the light.You feel as if Sheila Bellush is a close and trusted friend after reading this book. In addition, her noble widower Jamie, and the children involved really get into your heart.The emotional, physical, moral, and legal manipulations of Allen Van Houte are amazing to ponder; but those whose lives have been touched by domestic violence will not be surprised and may find reading this story to be cathartic, as Allen Van Houte gets his and then some in the end.A story not to be missed. Highly recommended for both Ann Rule fans and newbies alike.
This short mystery will have you on the edge of your seats. A great first in the series. I'm ready for the next one. You really get the feel for Edinburgh.
This book is significant to me mainly because I had to defend it in a case of censorship! In 1996 I was the librarian of an elementary school on Long Island, I job I had for ten years previously. My principal received a complaint about the book and in the interests of political correctness removed it from the shelf. My staff association and the local professional organization I belonged to at that time were instrumental in seeing that the book was returned. I have a different job now, but I recently bought a copy of this book just to remind me of the time I stood up to the censors. I firmly believe that censorship, whether from the left or the right, is wrong.
Now a child has died and the book referenced in court documents is this one.The description here on Amazon is poorly written, that's a clue right there. You cannot search inside the book. In the description, "discipline" is clearly misunderstood as "punishment." Discipline is not something you resort to when all else fails. Discipline is a life skill, a way of being, it is something to practice daily, a tool to use in attaining life goals. It is something you teach a child not something you do to a child.Poor Hanna Williams.
HIA is not King's best but is a worthy read. &quot;Low Men In Yellow Coats&quot; was the best part of the story and will considered one of Kings finest stories.&quot;Hearts In Atlantis&quot; was more of an emotional story and was written to express an overall message. &quot;Blind Willie&quot; and &quot;Why we are in Vietnam&quot; had important morals in them and gave purpose to the novel, but at times were slow. The last story &quot;Heavanly Shades Of Night are Falling&quot; pput all stories together and was a good, final read. It was a good book and I recommend &quot;The Green Mile&quot;, &quot;Misery&quot;, and &quot;Different Seasons&quot; as well.
I like this magazine as a sort of brain-storming idea-generating tool. Most of the articles are not in-depth enough to be the sole source of plans for executing the ideas. For instance a recent article about "DIY Solar Panels" was just a double-page-spread with most of the space consumed by a colorful diagram. But the mere fact that it alerted me to the existence of these new DIY kits, made it worthwhile.
I love this key/mail holder. It is simple and so functional and very sturdy. Great to keep your keys organized for sure. I highly recommend.
first heard him over the credits of the film GAME 6 doing Take Me Out To The Ball Game. sounded great. went out & bought this one based on all the reviews. he aint no Chet or Mel or Franks, but he is OK. i will even buy the disc with Take Me Out... on it. you can buy Baby, it gets better each listen.
After almost a year waiting, and preordering the book, it let me down. There are serious gaps, like how and when did Constance become Pendergasts ward, and who confronted her first, Wren or Pendergast?Before you go ripping into me, I am a serious fan of the authors and have read all their books, even some several times.IMO it was not up to par.SKM
If I am not wrong, this book has been previously released under the title &quot;Famous Mozart Operas. An analytical guide for the opera-goer and armchair listener&quot;, that's at least the title of the second edition I now have in front of me. For the readers acquainted with it, this new title may be a little misleading and suggesting a new revised edition. Equally misleading may be the double authorship: the Amazon.com database gives both Spike Hughes and Patrick Cairns Hughes as the book's authors, but this is simply a confusion resulting from the fact that Spike Hughes's real name - Patrick Cairns - has been used for copyrights. Hughes's book is a wonderful guide for anybody interested in Mozart operas - beginners will find here expert guidance through the operas' complicated plots, advanced Mozartians - a series of delightfully written essays highlighting many important points too often taken for granted. In the author's words, the book is meant to &quot;serve as a supplement to those programmes found in most opera houses or to the analytical notes on the picturesque &quot;sleeves&quot; of L.P. records (I imagine that the new edition has &quot;CD&quot; here) which tell the story in more or less intelligible terms but do not always explain why the tenor should suddenly want to burst into a song, nor what he is singing about when he does&quot;. The guide contains 343 musical illustrations usually no longer than 5-6 bars, designed, according to the author, with the student of orchestration in mind, but this shouldn't set off anybody without a reading knowledge of music. Even without it, one is able to follow and enjoy Hughes's musical arguments easily - his language is simple and devoid of heavy specialistic jargon, though readers with no theoretical knowledge of music may sometimes need to consult a little dictionary of musical terms. I can't help thinking how wonderful it would be if such a delightful book - one of its kind - could be re-edited in our CD-room era with these musical illustrations actually played - or, even easier, supplemented by references to certain milestone recordings (just little notes on the margin referring to tracks and timing - nothing more simple in the CD era!). The book is divided into 5 chapters, each devoted to one opera (&quot;Entfuehrung aus dem Serail; the three Da Ponte operas; Die Zauberfloete). Musical illustrations are inserted along the text and, where necessary, shortly discussed. These illustrations together with Hughes's insightful comments are the high points of the book and it would be difficult to find a popular introduction to Mozart's operas done with more charm combined with expertise. The guide is also very helpful in following stage productions of Mozart's operas either in the theater or on video. We have to remember that Mozart's stage instructions are very often skimpy and most of the important staging hints can be found in the libretti themselves (this seems to be of no importance to some opera directors today). Hughes's book offers its readers a vivid description of an &quot;ideal&quot; production, taking into considerations even the smallest of Mozart's stage directions. It also highlights certain difficult points, easily unnoticed, but important for the dramatic action. It is so easy to get lost in some of the plots - &quot;Marriage of Figaro&quot; being the best example - and Hughes does everything to make them as clear as possible, often borrowing helpful hints from literary works or other operas (here Beaumarchais's original play and Rossini's &quot;Barbiere&quot;). How many times did you wonder about the relation between Rossini's and Mozart's characters? If you are not eager to read Beaumarchais, this guide will answer all your questions. Here and there the author makes some mysterious statements that make you feel like a bad student who didn't do his homework. In the chapter on &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, page 200, description of Tamino's encounter with Papageno, brings a surprising piece of information about Papageno's past (supposedly told by Papageno himself): his &quot;mother had been in the service of the &lt;Queen who flames like a star at night&gt;&quot;. I was really surprised, since the libretto - at last in the form I know it - never says anything about Papageno's mother, even more - the bird-catcher, asked by Tamino about his parents, declares that he knows nothing about them. Everything he knows, he continues, is that he has his straw hut nearby, which protects him &quot;from the rain and cold&quot;. I don't know where the idea of Papageno's mother comes from, but before I suggest a mistake I would like to hear from more experienced Mozart opera lovers. The other strange statement appears in &quot;Cosi fan tutte&quot;, when Despina, laughing at the two &quot;Albanian&quot; visitors' appearances, says - in Hughes translation: &quot;What clothes! What faces! What moustaches! Are they Poles or Turks or what?&quot; I am Polish and I was very surprised to find an allusion to Poles in no less than one of the Mozart's masterpieces, while the whole operatic literature contains maybe two or three. Despina, however, doesn't say Poles, she says &quot;Vallacchi&quot;, what - if you listen to the opera without following the printed text - can easily be taken for &quot;Polacchi&quot;. But Poland was hardly exotic in Mozart's times (in fact, it never was because of generally Western character of its culture) and making Guglielmo and Ferrando look like Poles wouldn't help create an exotic aura around them. "Vallacchi" are simply Wallachians or Rumanians, if we want to use a more familiar term, Wal(l)achia being a province of Rumania. These are, however, minor complaints about the book that cannot be praised enough for its charm, general expertise and beautiful language - the world of Mozart's operas as seen through it is now even more delightful (if it were possible). Indispensable!
I had a old KithenAid I was happy with it. I needed new one after 10 years. I bought this new one,and it is a Cheaply made. It is not made like the old days. I will say by by by to KitchenAid. Never again.
This is the first novel from Robert Crais that I have read and I enjoyed reading it. Joe Pike is an interesting character, a bit strange and not exactly someone with an effervescent personality, but he was very different than your typical novel hero, and that's a good thing. The story itself is well done if a bit on the convoluted side. My guess is that the victim in the story is based on Paris Hilton, and I didn't find her to be very likeable. I also wasn't crazy about the possible love angle that the novel was brewing toward, but at least it never materialized. In all a good read.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity
I didn't see *Donnie Darko* in its theatrical release--matter of fact, I didn't even know it existed until I heard the song "Mad World" and found out it came from a movie. I was curious so I looked up the movie online, and what I read made me even more interested in seeing it. But I was concerned I might be bored because I knew the plot.So I found it on TV one night and sat watching so spellbound I didn't even change my position on the couch. About an hour into the movie, my husband came upstairs and said, "What are you watching?""Donnie Darko.""Oh. What's it about?"I had to sit there for about 30 seconds, and then the only explanation I could give was a sigh from the deepest part of my chest. And even then, when the movie was done, all I wanted to do was stare at the black TV screen for about another hour.So if you're worried about the surprises being ruined, rest assured it is impossible to write a spoiler for this film. Complex, layered, ambiguous, intense, and yes, dark, it is something you have to see to even begin to understand.The reviews here cover most aspects of the film's possible meanings, so I'm only going to add my one take. Now I'm not one to find religious messages in everything, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say I did see a few parallels between Donnie's story and the Jesus story. First, when Donnie starts telling the truth, people really resent it. The results are sometimes funny, sometimes sad, but they all have one thing in common: Nobody wants to listen because they're afraid of what they'll hear.Then you have Donnie's choice to accept his death. If he saves his own life, many other people's lives will be ruined; if he chooses to die, these people will be spared. And yet....Donnie dies and the motivational speaker is still mired in a horrid mess of a life; Donnie's family is devastated; and the gym teacher is still blinkering herself into a black/white paradigm. So did Donnie's death really serve any purpose? I won't give my answer to that question, because this is a film everyone must see and process for him- or herself. And this is why I would definitely recommend getting a DVD, because you need to watch it more than once to even start to sort it out.Very rarely does a film this powerful and affecting come along. Do not miss it!
This is a box set daring in the fact that the majority of it is improvisation, but if you are a King Crimson fan then that shouldn't faze you at all. I have been a die-hard for years now, and until this set The Great Deceiver had been my all-time favorite Crimson release (with maybe the exception of Larks Tongue, or Beat, or Red, depending on mood). Well, now KC have outdone themselves. Take the plunge. Buy the box!
Beautiful rich poetry read by beautiful rich voices. Can you beat Judi Dench, Michael Williams, Charlotte Attenborough and Paul Rhys. Please, please find me a copy. I need to own this.
The CHICKS are back and BETTER than ever, delivering no apologies for their freedom to speak. They are back more mature, more outspoken, and without the following of rednecks that are bible thumbing, cousin-humping fans that now hate them. WHO NEEDS YA! Thank you DIXIE CHICKS for your amazing new album. I cannot wait to see your concert, and it's been a long time gone.
I picked up ONE FOR THE MONEY because I'd recently been hearing all types of things about the Stephanie Plum novels. I went in with no pre-judgment about the series. I was pleasantly suprised by the novel. It was funny! You just and shake your head at all the things that Stephanie endures! It was such an original story line. I would recommend this book for anyone who wants to sit and let all their worries slide away with all the shenigans that Stephanie endures!!
This is probably one of the worst movies I have seen. I totaly recomend NOT to buy the movie.After a long wait, I have purchased this DVD, as I imagine most B-5 fans plan to do. Only three characters have re-joined this project from the original series - Sheridan, Lochley and the Techno-mage. Also, are added three new characters. That's it!!! No more characters are in the movie!!! All the dialogues are between six. and only six, characters!!! The dialogues themselves are long and boring. The acting itself lacks any imagination and the actors seem tired of the series and of themselves.Also, there are no special efects that are special, no exquisit space batles, nothing that will make this movie stand out on it's own. Even B-5 lacks details that were visible in the old series.To summerise - This movie was ment to be a cash infusion to those that made it. The movie is boring and lacks any charisma. One of the most boring movies I have seen in a long time. Wait till it goes below, way below, 10$.
Good plot & pretty good acting. Lots of interesting background scenery...may actually have been Slovakia. Wish Agnes Brucker would have shown more of her terrific body!
Why on earth is there no on/off switch on this thing? You turn it on and off by pulling the ungrounded plug out of the outlet.In my case, it came with sparks and flames.I'm throwing this thing out and using a pot with oil on the stovetop from now on. This product is poorly designed and actually dangerous to use...I can't believe all the rave reviews, but maybe they just like to live dangerously.
Would anyone like to buy a slightly used hard-back book? (Not going to be one added to my permanent collection.) It was like reading a text book in a subject you didn't like much. Slow, pedantic and way way too long. The characters were blah and the action non-existent. Reading this book was several hours of my life I want back!
This chair isn't fancy looking. I need a comfy chair on sit on and that's exactly what it helps me do. just a good and simple office chair. no complaints
I bought this after reading a review that it sounded about as good as a Denon SACD player with 4x the price. However, I find it to be unacceptable as an audiophile SACD player. I did an A/B comparison with my 3 year old Sony DVP-NS500V player (which sadly is not now recognizing the SACD layer on most new Hybrid SACD/CD discs!). The difference is decisive. With the Pioneer you cannot hear the "space" of the hall which you can hear with the Sony. And sibilants sound hissy and sandy on the Pioneer, while they sound airy on the Sony. In short, it suffers the defects of CD sound. I have read that some SACD universal players convert the DSD signal to 192 KHz PCM streams upon which they do D/A conversion. I suspect this is one of them. There ought to be some regulation requiring the disclosure of such "cheats". Caveat emptor. Don't buy this as an SACD player because it doesn't deliver SACD quality sound.
I was first introduced to the life of Mao by Edgar Snow's book 'Red Star Over China' I was greatly impressed with Mao. Then came the 1960's with the Cultural Revolution. I could not believe some of the crazy things initiated by Mao. This has been perplexing me ever since. This book is certainly a rude awakening for me. I can see that Snow's book was one-sided and highly biased. Here is finally a book written by a Chinese (I mean Chang) who grew up in China, lived through those turbulent times and did a fair amount of research in producing this book. While no one can prove the correctness and authenticities of all instances mentioned in this book, it certainly has been able to explain a lot of things that happened. Snow was genuine but he spent only a short time in Yenan and interviewed only Mao and Mao's men. Other books such as those by Ross Terill and Jerome Chen were far less detailed and authentic. I highly recommend this book
I am a 18 year old teenage girl and I loved this movie! It is so funny and all the characters are adorable, ecspecially Sid the sloth and the little baby! No matter what age you are, this movie is meant for all.
Appalling. It's not like there wasn't a formula for the makers of this pointless remake to follow, the original worked, it could have been updated, if not equalled.Instead, Demme throws out everything that made the original great - romance, humor, suspense, intelligent pacing, all so he can make a movie that seems to parody mainstream genre films and acts as a self-satisfied exercise in "New Wave" mimicry.Except the "New Wave" films were just that, new, they were doing something original. Demme's film seems an excuse for him to enjoy working in Paris, it certainly isn't coherent. Plot elements are raised, then forgotten, and what on earth is the crazy mother who murders people doing here, is this a comedy? By the maddening finale, the characters seem to have lost interest in the mystery, just as the audience has done by this point.Obviously remaking a film with Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, two of the greatest movie stars of all time, was going to be difficult, but why even bother when all you have to offer is Marky Mark and Thandie Newton. With George Clooney and Nicole Kidman, or others of that caliber, it might have been a good idea, the original works because of the star power and their chemistry. This poor enterprise was doomed from the start.The definition of the pointless remake, makes Gus Van Sant's "Psycho" seem creative and original.
Rebecca Parris is a jazz singer with a beautiful alto and a style of her own While she may not be hip or young or sexy, she's the real thing. I'm not crazy about some of the synthesized orchestrations accompanying Ms. Paris- otherwise I would have given the CD 5 stars.
Super expensive and really so no difference in this oil and other much less expensive oils.. I think its a bunch of hype and people are making a lot of money off peoples hunger for something that is a miracle, which don't exist . Actually, I think bio oil works much better and about one-tenth of the price
One of the greatest albums of all time by the greatest band of all time- it just doesn't get any better than this! From the hypnotic bassline and raging chorus of "Longview" to the catchy, slightly-whiny punk sound of "Basket Case", Green Day has truly produced a masterpiece. Tre's drumming skills are amazing, especially in "Basket Case", and I may sound sort of old-fashioned by saying this, but Billie Joe plays a mean guitar. Green Day is just as enduring as bands such as The Ramones, and their music will be remembered for generations to come, unlike the Hilary Duffs and Justin Timberlakes that plaque today's entertainment. Another thing on the album that I'm blown away by is Billie Joe Armstrong's voice. It's got a great, melodic tone to it and never ceases to impress me, yet he still manages to add an edgy, punk-rock feel to it.Some of the stand-out tracks on the album are: Longview, When I Come Around, Basket Case, Having A Blast, Eminus Sleepus (the only song on the album written by Mike Dirnt) Welcome to Paradise, She, and F.O.D- they're all great, of course. There's even a hidden track at the end of the CD called All By Myself, performed by Tre Cool...well worth the wait of 2 minutes and something-seconds after F.O.D.Green Day is everything a punk rock band should be- fun, upbeat,in-your-face, swears in their lyrics, and most of all, talented! This CD came out in 1994, and is still appreciated by rock fans everywhere. If an album debued in 1994 and you can still listen to it 11 years later an enjoy it, then it must be good.
I bought these based on a glowing HDTV magazine review. We now have 3 of these, 2 used for tvs and one for a pc monitor, they all work great with great clarity, color and contrast. We use them with HD DVD players and satellite HDTV, and the pictures could not be better, even the onboard sound is adequate for bedrooms etc.
I DONT KNOW IF ARE THINGS OF MINE, BUT I HAVE MORE THAN 5 YEARS USING THIS STYLE,ADIDAS SAMOA, SO I THINK THIS SNEAKERS FROM THIS STORE ITS NO GENUINE 'CAUSE THE "LEATHER" ITS TOO HARD, BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS BLACK UNIT I HAD BOUGHT A WHITE ONE TO AMAZON STORE AND THOSE IF SEEMS TO BE GENUINE, LEATHER ITS VERY SOFT, BUYERS TAKE CARE WHO YOU BUY
This album is by far the BEST Britney album to date. The title fits so perfectly too, because once you pop it in, you will be IN THE ZONE! FOR SERIOUS! She is NOT a little girl anymore, she is ALL grown up, and TAKING OVER HER LIFE! Let the girl live, and buy in the zone!
First, I would like to say a word to all of the people who dissed &quot;Liz Phair&quot;... What is your Problem?! This record is absolutely perfect in every way! Your problem is that you are obsessed with a sound, not her credibility... and if youd take time to listen the words she says, and the pictures she paints, youd see that she is just as open, honest, and funny as on her previous three records. All she did was make her songs more accessible.The record begins with &quot;Extraordinary&quot; which spits out power chords and vocals like theres no tomorrow. Next comes another Standout track,&quot;Red Light Fever&quot;, which is THE BEST song on the record...hands down. None even compare. Other standouts are &quot;Rock ME&quot;, &quot;Favorite&quot; &quot;Love/Hate&quot; &quot;Friend of Mine&quot; &quot;Bionic Eyes&quot; and &quot;Good Love Never Dies&quot; all of these songs are head and shoulders above the lead single &quot;why cant I&quot;. She is also discovering more of her voice. Its no longer just a thing to get the words out, Now its as much as an emotional vehicle as her guitar. To sum it up, Perfect melding between Pop and Raw, from an Indie Goddess
With its latest outing, MASTERPIECE THEATRE, En Vogue hasaccomplished a spectacular feat. By using classical music fromBeethoven and Tchaikovsky as the basis for funky R&amp;B gems, the ladies of En Vogue have not only updated their signature sound, they have created a landmark record that is elegant, sophisticated and incredibly infectious.The unforgettable &quot;Riddle&quot; is easily the best song of the year thus far, which is why it is truly shameful Top 40 radio has not embraced this rare gem. I suggest using Amazon's search engine to locate a copy of the domestic 12&quot; single, as it features fantastic remixes and an a cappella rendition. No En Vogue collection is complete without it.&quot;No No No (Can't Come Back)&quot; is a deceptively simple song with a cool, relaxed groove that evokes the plaintive splendor of Janet Jackson's &quot;Got 'til It's Gone.&quot;&quot;Falling in Love&quot; demonstrates the remarkably well-executed histrionics of MASTERPIECE THEATRE. The sultry vocals are wonderfully emotive and set to a sparkling beat that best complements Cindy Herron's angelic voice.&quot;Suite Intro&quot; opens Love Suite, the set of songs set against the backdrop of classical music. The first, &quot;Love U Crazay,&quot; is probably the only R&amp;B song with rap interludes set to an instantly recognizable &quot;Nutcracker&quot; theme. How, you'll ask yourself, did En Vogue incorporate threads of rap, funk, R&amp;B, and operatic voices and make it sound so damn sexy? No matter. It's pure brilliance, just like the rest of the album.&quot;Sad But True&quot; shall become one of En Vogue's signature songs and it's proof that the ladies are adept at delivering ballads. Unlike the slow En Vogue ballads of yore, namely &quot;Too Gone Too Long&quot; and &quot;No Fool No More,&quot; &quot;Sad But True&quot; works extremely well on ALL levels, which is why the seamless transition to the next song, &quot;Love Won't Take Me Out,&quot; is so incredible. Itself, a seamless blend of operatic majesty and girl-group sentiments, &quot;Love Won't Take Me Out&quot; is as artful and innovative as anything on the album, but, like every track, it is entirely distinguishable from its counterparts, something that is sorely lacking in modern R&amp;B.&quot;Whatever Will Be Will Be&quot; is &quot;Que Sera Sera&quot; reinvented. Fittingly, this heartfelt and moving homage closes the Love Suite, but its successor is no slouch. &quot;Beat of Love&quot; is a sultry invitation to sample En Vogue's decidedly more mature direction and its exotic musical landscape is dangerously inviting.With &quot;Latin Soul,&quot; we could easily assume En Vogue is exploiting the current latin-pop trend for some quick sales. Not so. This lush gem ranks with Madonna's &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; as a catchy tribute to the magic of Latin music, not an exercise in tired cliches from the likes of Marc Anthony or Ricky Martin.&quot;Work It Out&quot; doesn't compare with &quot;Riddle&quot; or any of the songs during the Love Suite, but it is spirited fun, nonetheless.&quot;Those Dogs&quot; features the trademark &quot;human beat-box&quot; vocal stylings of &quot;Don't Worry Be Happy&quot; singer Bobby McFerrin, himself a pioneer in the arena of classical music. (He currently conducts a symphony on the East Coast.) To contrast with the loving tribute to the symphonic sound, En Vogue inserts its trademark attitude with exciting results.&quot;Number One Fan&quot; closes the album and it is instantly evocative of some of the wonderful jazz standards of late. In fact, like all of MASTERPIECE THEATRE, the song is a perfect balance of contemporary attitude and respectful tribute.So, you may ask, is there anything unlikable about En Vogue's latest? No. However, I do have some qualms about the cover art. As a member since its inception, Maxine Jones shouldn't be virtually unrecognizable. It's rather ironic, because I believe that Miss Jones contributed much to the overall ambience of this record. As of today, she is officially my favorite member of En Vogue and I have her and her group mates to thank for my favorite record of the year thus far.
Clearly many of the reviewers did not realize that this was a B movie. As such, the ratings (if you go in for B movies) have to be adjusted accordingly. As a B movie, I give it 5 stars. If I were to grade it on the quality I would expect from an A list movie, I would have to give it less than 1 star. But lets be realistic here folks, buying a movie just because the picture on the box is reminiscent of an A list movie, does not "ever" make the movie a great or even good movie. This is schlock at its best. FX are not so bad for a B movie. Yes, the only two recognizable names in the movie have less than stellar parts, heck even somewhat limited parts. To be honest, I never realized Priscilla Barns could look so bad. And, I used to have a crush on her. Well, if you were married to the person I was married to at the time, you would understand. But, I digress, and I do now have a wonderful wife. The funny thing about this movie is, that it's a sequel to a movie called "Unseen Evil" also of poor quality. With a very similar plot-line "If you see the beast you are already dead." This story picks up with the one lone survivor of the first movie in a nut-hutch etc. Sound familiar, it should, it's been done in many horror movies in the past. So,if you like B list movies, poor FX, and you know what you are getting when you buy this, you will enjoy it as much as I did. If you prefer a higher class of loser as Garth sings, then stay away from this movie.Rod
Any movie in which Michael Caine, a doddering fart at the best of times, comes off as rip-roaringly funny without telling a single joke has got to be well-written. As such, this Michael Caine movie serves as an effective antidote to most other Michael Caine movies, with oddly little change in performance on his part.As for Steve Martin, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is practically 20 years old and still stands the test of time as one of his most creative, dynamic, and hilarious roles. "Ruprecht" will have you peeing yourself with laughter.By my recollection this was a sleeper of a movie when released, but that should only enhance what I hope will one day be the movie's cult status.
This is the worst piece of garbage ever committed to film. No wonder they broke up.
Last Man Standing would have had hope except they reworked the song. The better version was on the box set. Last Cigarette, Novocaine, Bells of Freedom, Who Says You Can't Go Home, all very psuedo-pop tunes. This sounds more like Tom Petty or the Wall Flowers. No punch at all. Have a Nice Day is a 3rd rate anthem. This album is just as lousy as This Left Feels Right. Bounce & Crush had better songs on them than this effort. Since Crush, their album sales have been slipping. It's great that this album is number 1 in Scandinavia & Japan, but when was the last time either place cranked out a great band of their own? It's still ok to do straight-forward rock & roll. Don't let today's radio tell you differently.
The author, a general surgeon, takes us on his journey through coronary bypass surgery, from the realization that there was really something wrong to his reflections on the process once he was through it. Through his eyes we see typical denial of symptoms that he knows well, a lesson for anyone avoiding the doctor. He takes us throught he search for the right place for surgery; revealing that he, like many people, makes his final decision as much on an emotional basis as on a medical one. We see his frustration with the thousand insults that patients must deal with, such as being awakened on the night before surgery for antibiotic injections that are painful enough to keep him awake on a night he thinks he should get as much rest as possible.For medical professionals, the book is a humbling look at things we could do better to care for our patients. For patients, though a little dated, it provides a guide as to what they can expect.
There are 100s of other reviews saying the same thing but I just had to add to the dissent. The video itself is muddy. The menus are extremely sub par (no 'Play All' and so on), many skips and break ups and so on... For the price you would think it would on a technical level be as good as the tapes but it barely is. It is sad that companies KNOW people are going to buy it anyway, so they half-ass it anyway (farscape series dvds comes to mind).
qotsa return with quite possibly their best album to date with lullabies to paralyze. this album is a little more brooding than previous releases with some bluesy guitar riffs and repeated choruses. there is the radio hit "little sister" and other outstanding tracks like "burn the witch" (a little help from zz top axeman), and others like "everybody knows you're insane". this album is best listened to at night while dark riffs and wicked songs display the queens best whole album. lullabies gets better with repeated listens and stands out of their previous releases. dave grohl's drumming is missed and where is that bass player? it doesn't matter too much, it's excellent on it's own.
I bought this printer used for $90. Set up via Ethernet was relatively easy, although I haven't been able to get USB to work. I've printed on HP Premium Plus Soft Gloss, and the quality is very very good. Color rendition could be better, but allowing CS3 to control color helps.I've also printed on an Epson 3800 and 7800, and this printer is not far off in terms of quality prints - with the exception of deep blue skies. The HP 8750 does not handle extensive areas of deep blue sky well (golden hour at Sunrise/Sunset). The subtle tonal variations tend to get lost.Supplies (consumables such as 3 ink catridges and 25 sheets of premium paper) run about $140 for 30 8x10 prints. That averages to $4.50 per 8x10 print . . . ouch, but not much worse than other photo prints. The standard cartridges for photos are HP Photo Blue (101), HP Tri-color (97), and HP Photo Grey (102). There are different cartridges available for special printing, such as sepia or colored line drawings.I've called HP for customer support. The first person hung up on me after realizing they could not fix the problem. The second person was much more helpful. I've heard some people describe HP support as a "mine field", but you can get quality technical support if you are dilligent.I like this printer alot. I will use it for art school homework, but probably not for my fine art prints that I intend to hang - like I said, color rendition can be very very good, but for certain colors is not consistent.
This may seem like a lot to spend on a yoga DVD, but you get so much for your money. It's well worth it.It's a 2-set DVD.The first DVD is lecture on theory on Yin Yoga, learning the yang sequences, and special features including biographies, demonstration performances, and more. Paul Grilley is an excellent presenter. He explains in a very clear, complete, and sometimes humorous way the theory behind Yin Yoga. Yin yoga works on your connective tissue and not so much muscular stretching like other yogas.The second DVD includes the practice and has three one-hour Yin practices: hip series, spine series, and infanct series. All practice is done on the floor and you hold the postures for up to five minutes to work on your connective tissues. I love these practices and Yin yoga is a great way to balance out vinyasa or bikram yoga practices (Yang). For each of these 3 practices you have two choices of audio: either indepth instruction or just queues. What a great idea! Once you know the practices you won't normally want to listen over and over to the detailed instructions and this option allows you to do that. Paul leads the instruction in a very pleasant and complete manner.Also included on the practice DVD are three Yang practices running about 2 minutes each. These are a beautifual mix on vinyasa style yoga and tai chi. You have the options to loop each one individually or sequence-repeat in any order you like. This is a lovely way to customize your workout to whatever your energy level is for any given day.The final practice on the DVD is four routines with still photos and queues. Again you can mix and match how you want. This is lovely way to make your own practice without distraction of a class room setting.My acupuncturist recommended this style of yoga and I was so happy to find this DVD. It has balanced out my home practice and my Bikram yoga practice. The producers of this DVD have done a fabulous job of designing the interactive screens. I only wish they would have added some light music in the background, but you can always have a CD player at hand to add your own. Paul Grilley instructions are very clear and soothing and his students demonstrate for both beginning, intermediate, and advanced practice. Suzee Grilley demonstrates the advanced postures and she radiates them beautifully.I highly recommend this DVD for everyone. Please, also see my other yoga DVD reviews on Amazon.
Joe Bob's drive-in books of the past were certainly funny and sometimes informative, but cult film lovers looking for more meat on the bone will enjoy "Profoundly Disturbing." Instead of the standard Joe Bob treatment (breast counts, number of car crashes and/or severed limbs), he gives us an extremely informative and genuinely affectionate take on some of the most influential underground movies to ever offend delicate, G-rated sensibilities. Some of the flicks covered are even respectable (but no less offensive)-- the chapter on "Crash" is one of my favorites. Maybe fans who will accept absolutely NOTHING from John Bloom except his Joe Bob alter ego won't like it because of its lack of redneck element, but for fans (and cult film lovers) who appreciate the fact that behind Joe Bob there is a rather more intellectual and subtle mind, this is a great read.
In a million years I wouldn't have expected something like this from the comedian that I have enjoyed for so long. I knew he was talented as a comedian and actor but I never knew that his talent stretched to this avenue. This book is so beautifully written it reads like poetry. It isn't a long book but that doesn't cause a lack of depth in his characters. There are books out there 700 pages that don't give the depth that Shopgirl's 130 pages give you. I felt like I was watching Mirabelle live her life in 3-D as I read this. Read this book simply so that you can see this other side of one of the funniest men alive. You won't be able to help but enjoy it. I am adding this to my mental list of favorite reads.
For the most part, anything that is advertised on those infomercials over-promises or fails to deliver. I ordered a Magic Bullet anyway because it seemed to be just the sort of kitchen appliance that I needed...small, safe and useful. I crossed my fingers and ordered one. When the package arrived, it was packed nicely in a large case containing all the parts and accessories as advertised; mixing cups, drinking/mixing mugs, small blender attachment, juicer attachment, shaker cups, two receipe books, an instruction manual, blades and motor base. Basically, the Magic Bullet is a small compact blender that is turned on it's head. Instead of putting items from the top and blending/chopping them, you put the contents in a holding cup and twist on the cap/blade. This whole unit is then placed upside down on the base and you turn it on. After the contents are processed, you take the unit off the base and twist off the blade/cap. A great and ingenious idea. But the big question is, does it work as advertised? The surprising answer is yes.I've had this unit for about a month and a half now and am thoroughly surprised at how nice it works. I have made smoothies that not only rival the local juice bars, but the product tastes better and is a snap to make. I have also made personal servings of soup and vegatable smoothies. Making a tuna-egg-mayo spread was blended very nicely and the whole family ate it up in a couple of days. To get this unit to work as it was intended has to do with reading the manual. It states very clearly that there are certain ways to load your mixing cup. In cases where things do not get blended or are stuck at the top of the cup, the instructions tell you to take the blending cup off and to tap it a few times to get all the contents to the bottom. There is no problem in overheating *if you read the manual*. About 90% of the jobs can be done in about 10 seconds or less by using the pulse method. If you continuously blend/chop and leave it on like a regular blender, it will overheat and possibly break the unit. Nothing needs to be processed for more than 30 seconds so this is a moot point. Clean-up is one of the best features of this appliance. Just run the mixing cups and blades under water with a little soap, and you are done. This unit is so easy to use that our family uses it on a daily basis.As far as the cost is concerned, it may seem a little on the steep end, but the Magic Bullet pays for itself in no time at all. It has many useful features which allow you to use it as a coffee grinder, a chopper, a blender, a smoothie maker, a sandwich spread maker, soup mixer, etc. I have never used a small kitchen appliance as much as I have used the Magic Bullet. The big blender made by -------, which has been sitting on the shelf for many years is now officially retired.A few minutes of your time in reading the manual will help you dodge any bullets in using the Magic Bullet.
I have been a satisfied Webroot customer for five years now, but I'm afraid our relationship is nearing termination.As others have said, the 'nag' screens are getting ridiculous. They also automatically enroll you in auto renewal whenever you upgrade one of their products and only tell you about it in the fine print. It's easy enough to opt out, but still.My mom had been using Spy Sweeper successfully in conjunction with Trend Micro Antivirus for a couple of years and then upgraded to Webroot Antivirus with AntiSpyware 5.8 and started having problems. The two are no longer compatible. I use it in conjunction with Norton on mine and it works fine though.Webroot just came out with 5.8, now they already have a new version 6. I tried it the other day and it absolutely horrible. They have this new 'online backup' feature that they nag you incessantly to enroll in. Supposedly all the data they back up is encrypted, but I don't know why anyone in their right mind would do this. I seriously doubt it will be going away either. I think the next time my renewal is due I'm just going to get Norton Internet Security and say goodbye to Webroot.
Toro: Say Pancho, wasn't Out of Sync a bad bunch of gringos. Pancho: Aye Caramba Toro, they were stupido. Toro: At least they are now dead. Pancho: Their last album had clunkers like Gone and Girlfriend and Pop. Toro: They broke up because they hate each other. Pancho: They all hate Stinkercake for leaving them high and dry after he became successful. Toro and Pancho say if you own this, like Cranky Reviewer and his boyfriends, you will become flies for us to eat. BAMINOS PRONTO from these stupido gringos!
Darlene Love is still, after all these years, one ofthe "best kept secrets in show business". Not thatshe isn't well-known in music circles, and to herfaithful following, but this is a woman with so muchtalent that she should be singing before selloutcrowds at Radio City Music Hall. While she may bebest-known for her sublime recordings with PhilSpector and for playing Danny Glover's wife in allof the Lethal Weapon films, Darlene has maintaineda high standard of vocal brilliance for the last40 years (she's 61 as of 2002). This recording findsher tackling a nice variety of Gospel songs, sungwith all of the fervor and passion you would expect.The CD is produced by Edwin Hawkins of "Oh Happy Day"fame, and Darlene truly gets you "feelin' the spirit".Some of the arrangements are too heavy with cheesysynth backgrounds, but Darlene and the fantastic choirof first-rate gospel singers more than make up for that.If you want to get your feet tapping, your face smiling,and your heart soaring, pick up this CD. You won'tregret it!!
As reviewers noted, the watch is only a watch and not a very attractive one at that. Nothing special except it keeps current time by consulting a source. The clock is a zany mystery. Who knows how it works ! Designed by a superior practical joker, perhaps versed in quantum mechanics.
In a world in which every middle class parent worries if their child isn't top notch in everything, this book is a beautiful classic to remind us all to relax. I collect children's books, and my husband suggested this one, as he loved it as a child. When I got it, I loved it immediately. It assures children and parents that people progress at different levels, but everybody blooms. My husband was a very small child, shorter than everyone in his class, and this book brought him comfort and encouraged him in what he was good at. About 20 or 25 years later, he's a self-confident, very socially adept doctor! I remember struggling very much in kindergarten and first grade with everything from cutting to skipping to math to reading. Everything clicked for me around 2nd or 3rd grade, and school became a breeze after that. I became self-assured, and successful. I wish I'd had this book when I was struggling with those things... I might have been more confident from the start!For the reviewer concerned that parents would delay help for their children, I doubt a kid's book would have that effect. Parents can tell when something is wrong, and one children's book is going to sway them from taking action!Oh, and the big bonus... the illustrations are darling, and classic 1970's renderings. The words are absolutely heartwarming!
This seemed like a great flash drive at first. One day after using it for a couple of months, I thought "Gee, I really ought to back this up since I've heard that flash drives can die suddenly." I should have followed my instinct, but no... I saved a couple of additional files and did a safe removal of the drive. The next time I plugged it in it did not work--no computer could detect it. All that data gone. I replaced it with a SanDisk with USB--much better. (I back that one up frequently.)
"From Hell", the 2005 Jack the Ripper opus from the Hughes Brothers, almost makes the grade as the definitive movie about Victorian England's elusive killer. It's certainly atmospheric enough, with fog-shrouded alleyways and convincingly evocative street scenes brought vividly to life by cinematographer, Peter Deming.Most of the performances are first-rate, too, with Johnny Depp a standout as Inspector Frederick Abberline, a real-life detective who, for purposes of the film, is gifted with psychic talents and cursed with a drug problem. Bedraggled and debauched, Depp drags Abberline through the grim proceedings with intelligence and compassion; he's empathetic with the Whitechapel crowd, but wary, as well. He looks on the ill-fated prostitutes as fellow human beings fallen on hard times, but their men are something else, entirely. Vicious, cunning, and altogether amoral, any number of these men rivaled the infamous serial killer in terms of misogyny and violence against women. Robbie Coltrane is also fine as Abberline's nursemaid/assistant. Tough and blunt, Coltrane heaves his hulking bulk after the addled Depp, trailing him from murder scene to opium den with the weary acceptance of a loyal manservant; it is Coltrane who gives the movie its true heart. Ian Holm, as Sir William Gull, physician to the Queen, also gives a finely shaded, elegant performance as a medical man practicing long past his point of retirement. More problematic, I think, is Heather Graham, a uniquely modern, American actress who, here, attempts to assay the role of a 19th Century London prostitute, and none too successfully. I like Graham alright, but she's just not a fit with this film. Her accent isn't convincing, and she just doesn't have the acting chops to carry off the important role of Mary Jane Kelley. The American actress, Susan Clark, fared better as Mary Kelley in the 1979 film, "Murder By Decree", and I think therein lies a big part of the problem that I have with "From Hell". Not Heather Graham's performance, but comparisons with the earlier film."Murder By Decree" featured famed fictional sleuth, Sherlock Holmes, and his sidekick, Dr. Watson, frantically chasing around London in an attempt to find, and put a stop to Jack the Ripper's madness. In this film, Christopher Plummer and James Mason excelled in the roles of the dynamic Holmes and Watson, with Genevieve Bujold, David Hemmings, Donald Sutherland, Sir John Gielgud, and Anthony Quayle rounding out the big-name cast. While not perfect, "Murder By Decree" seems to me to be a more cohesive film, and covers much of the same territory that is retread in "From Hell". In fact, except for the detectives, "From Hell" could have been, essentially, a remake.The same could also be said with regards to the 1988 miniseries, which is perhaps, to date, the definitive Jack the Ripper story. In it, Michael Caine convincingly portrayed an older, wiser Abberline (minus the ESP and drug problem), Armand Assante played a suspect, Jane Seymour and Susan George were among the menaced women, and Ray McAnally was cast as Sir William Gull. The miniseries played out over several nights, giving it time to present a more detailed mystery, and to delve more deeply into the characters of those involved. "From Hell" also seems to borrow liberally from this miniseries, thereby giving it a less-than-fresh feel(although the in-your-face gore is something missing from either of these earlier treatments).While "From Hell" suffers from comparisons to earlier films, it is still stylish and exciting, with (mostly) good performances, so it should satisfy fans of period thrillers.
I READ FIVE REVIEWS THAT JUST SAID THIS CD WAS FULL OF WACK SKITS AND WACK LYRICS, LISTEN GUYS, FIRST WHY DON'T YOU GO F^%K YOURSELF, AND THEN WHY DON'T YOU BUY ANOTHER PUFF DADDY CD AND LISTEN TO IT HAPPILY ALL DAY LONG....THESE GUYS INNOVATED THE GAME, THEIR GRITTY STREET STYLE, THEIR HARD BEATS , AND THEIR DELIVERY. THIS ALBUM IS UNTOUCHABLE. IF YOU DON'T LIKE THEIR STYLE OF DELIVERY THATS FINE ITS NOT FOR YOU, JUST LIKE LISTENING TO BILLY RAY CYRUS IS NOT FOR ME. BUT TO SAY THAT THEY ARE WACK AS RAPPERS AND FOR STARTING AN UNDERGROUND MOVEMENT, THATS JUST SILLY. YOU JERKS ARE ENTITLED TO YOUR OPINIONS BUT I GOT NEWS FOR YOU, LOOK AT THE OTHER REVIEWS FOR THE CD, THERE IS ALMOST 400 5 STAR REVIEWS AND ABOUT 7 1 STAR REVIEWS, WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU....LEMME SPELL IT OUT FOR YOU, YOU GUYS ARE WAY OFF ON YOUR REVIEW, I MEAN ONE OF THE REVIEWS SIMPLY READ: "SOUTH SID" WHATEVER THAT MEANS...ANOTHER ONE SAID : "THIS ALBUM IS STRAIGHT RETARTED" AND YES THEY SPELLED RETARDED LIKE THAT...IF YOU CAN'T SPELL THE WORD RETARDED IT MEANS YOU ARE MENTALLY CHALLENGED...HOW IRONIC. FOR ALL THOSE SERIOUS BUYERS OUT THERE, DON'T WAIT ON THIS ONE....CLASSIC FOR ALL TIME
Scary Monsters has a special place in my heart.The (then) latest in recording technology really caught up to Bowie's bizarre visions. He presents us with some truly strange soundscapes that evoke, among other things, isolation (Ashes to Ashes), cheeky ire (Fashion), and paranoia (It's No Game Part 1).An epic, multitextural album.
Just because the movie is not funny does not make it a bad comedy. It's full of screaming, crashing, and fighting, which more than makes up for the lack of jokes, gags, and humor. John Belushi was funny in Animal House so there you are. The video contains an ample supply of videotape and the packaging will look good with any home decor. If you are the type that buys this movie, you will watch it again and again and howl insanely with laughter! I laughed so hard I began to hemorrhage, and that was just from looking at the cover art! A masterpiece!
Read my review - and then reread the one bad review listed here:(*----) "Fundamentally disappointing, December 27, 2004"Reviewer: Brian Huff "bex" (Minneapolis, MN, USA) "the guy with the physics degree...."is very typical, disappointingly misleading and a prime example of the closed mindedness the documented scientists in the following books are facing as they peer into a window that shows a startling new universal picture of the ALL, not a machine broken down into pieces that are analyzed separately and incorrectly isolated from one another . Here is another "degree" who has all the answers and all else is incorrect and childish. I surmise it may be a PhD "piled higher and deeper" mentality who wrote this as he begins the critique with his degree in hand as a child hugs a security blanket! God forbid there should be something he doesn't understand or doesn't fit in his square peg hole! Maybe Newton or Einstein was the hero not to be de-throned. But those are the teachers that allow these men and women take the next steps because "they stood on the shoulders of giants". The student should surpass the teacher, or perhaps the teachers have failed....because it is a slow-evolving process....such is science.For anyone interested in keeping up to date with the discouragingly courageous efforts of those who are seeking the next paradigm shift in our window of the all (health notwithstanding), this book is excellent reading.I have read this book and "The Holographic Universe" at the same time and it is awesome to find that some insightful people are seriously seeking answers to how the all is related and functioning. Do read both if not at same time (excellent cross reference), but at least check out both together. Some seriously intelligent and insightful people are working on puzzles and concepts that indeed boggle the mind and make for stranger than fiction, King-size Kudos to those doing the work and those trying to get the word out on this exciting new realm of understanding.Most advanced physicists have overlooked these theories and have a difficult time understanding them once they are exposed to them - and sure, it is theory because they will only be confirmed as our technology advances far enough to allow certain experiments only possible to think about at this time. This is analogous to the fact that penicillin was available way before it was possible to use the technology needed to preserve and allow dispensing it to the masses. Before that technological process became available, it could be made by the incredible man who discovered and researched it but the time of tech was not right and up to speed to allow it to be stabilized for distribution.Quite a bit about what is discussed, elementary info, is covered in chem. 101 and physics 101 is valid, but the theories and their repercussions touch on new age and metaphysical aspects of the unexplainable in life, which is where the walls of ignorance and arrogance of conventional critics begin being built.Most of the world renown scientists admit we should not close our minds to possibilities that are at this point incomprehensible by the man-child, mankind. Take a look at history and you will know what we have seen from critics in the past, whether the elite educational institutions or the vile penalizing church censorships.A physics degree is nothing in comparison to the work the men and women in these chapters of this book and "the holographic universe" are doing and the lone (with few associate visionaries) journey fraught with adversity and ridicule.Read these books - they may change how you look at life and the energies you are part of and influence hour by hour!Don't let closed minds without specific data contrary to these theories close your mind or deter you from exploring the marvelous mysteries of the world and universe outside of conventional close mindedness. The people who are the first to throw credentials and titles at people to intimidate them into being part of the masses that follow the piper and say the emperor has clothes on!Get a history degree and vow not to support the repetition of our errors through ignorance and ignorance - that is my advice to one-star critic.May the Force(s) be with you ALL! ;-)
Does what it says it does...There is an application you can run on your computer which will tell you all sorts of stuff about your power like how many jiggawattz you're using and how many volts are being supplied and how many minutes you can expect to compute after the power's out. For reference, my conventional desktop has a 3.2ghz AMD 64x2 proc and a fanless ATI video card & two 7200rpm hard drives, and draws an average 90w with 17" lcd monitor - which this device claims it'll run for about 30-33 minutes.So there you have it. I unplugged it from the wall and it screeched at me and my computer did not seem to care.. apart from logging the event on the included software. Woo!
You kind of have to be a silent-movie geek or a hopeless romantic to love this movie. Luckily I'm both.This movie is based off of a book of the same title by E.M. Hull. A defiant young British woman is trying to avoid marriage (or at least postpone it) because she sees it as the end of independence for women. To do so, she decides to take a small "vacation" into the Arabian desert. The night before she is to take off, she sneaks into an Arabs-only party, dressed as an arab woman, but is disovered by the ever-handsome and ever-flamboyant Rudolph Valentino, who plays the Sheik Ahmed ben Hussan. He arranges to kidnap her on her trip and make her fall in love with him. Adventure and romance ensues and fun is had by all...or most.I particularly like this movie for several reasons:1. RV is in it.2. the flamboancy of the movie is just too much fun. very few things are understated.3. the protrayal of the characters is well done and comes across strongly in this silent movie. Ever emotion is well portrayed, many times as subtly as could be done during the silent movie era.Keep in mind; this movie was made at a time when racism was not only rampant but almost strongly encouranged and when inter-racial marriage was not allowed and highly frowned upon. As such, adjustments were made to the movie's story and this movie has quite a few derogatory portrayals of Arabs in it. This is kind of to be expected in a movie from this era, but it's still kind of a shock from todays standards.This is one of the classics from that era. In my opinion, it's a must-have for any silent movie fan's collection.
This season is drawn differently, but the same voice actors are used. Yes, the 1st season was better, but if you love the show you'll still like this one. The plot line through the whole season was a little weak. I was also hoping for a little more character development and interaction. Over all it was fun to watch.
Here you have all his hit songs from the past Seven Years (1998-2005) under his name ATB. The album starts off in the year 2005, and moves backwards into his productions. (For me it would have been better to have it start from the first album, as you can hear the difference in sound and production from his first song and last.)From his first hit single, 9PM, which was named after which time it was when he completed it, to 6 brand-new tracks made just for this collection, this is perfect for anyone wanting to get a complete ATB album or for any ATB fan.From Movin' Melodies (9PM, Don't Stop), Killer) to Two Worlds (The Summer, The Fields of Love) you hear ATB's signature guitar sounds.Once you venture into his album Dedicated, you don't hear that sound anymore but you still get ATB as he evolves (Let U Go, Hold You, You're Not Alone) as he features Roberta Carter Harrison as the vocals on the album.ATB really showcases his music in Addicted to Music (I Don't Wanna Stop, Long Way Home, In Love With the D.J.) and shows a more mature, more developed style of music. He again works with Roberta to make some beautiful tracks.We then get to his most recent album, No Silence, where he shows a truly versatile side with variedsong arrangements and styles. With the first single featured in the movie, Mindhunters, Marrakech finally features a new vocalist, Tiff Lacey (Oakenfold, Conjure One). As well as two other tracks, Ecstasy and Here With Me.The rest are 5 new tracks and a 2005 re-work of "Let U Go", sung by the same vocalist on the third track as well as guitar melodies... (Roberta does a better job in my opinion, though the slower-pace and guitars are pretty sweet.)All tracks are edited for time and some are different from their original album appearences. You'll find edits that have never made any singles.With 6 brand-new tracks and edited tracks, this is definitely something for any ATB fan to get.Even if you're not a ATB album collector, it is definitely something to get your hands on if you have never experienced the sounds of ATB.
This Toshiba 27AF42 TV is totally awesome! I read all the reviews before buying it, including the few negatives ones regarding horizontal and vertical line regularity.If there is some irregularity when viewing boxes onscreen, I haven't noticed it, and the picture itself is mind-boggling! It's hard to believe that a &quot;high definition&quot; televison would or could be much higher definition than this one.The &quot;picture in picture&quot; version costs a little more, and I've heard PIP isn't worth the cost, but with this set it might be a nice feature, given how sharp this set is.I have two points to make, however, based on the other reviews I've read here. First, don't trust what you see in a TV store, with a large number of other brands' 27 inch flat screen models next to the Toshiba. Most stores apparently use some kind of signal splitter, which seems to degrade ALL the sets in the store, due to a loss of signal strength caused by the way they split the original signal.Secondly, this Toshiba offers something else that my girlfriend and I saw immediately. It gives you a strong sense of 3-dimensionality, with objects in the background actually appearing to have depth. For example, a sitcom series was on TV last night (one that we've seen many times before on other television sets), and the scene of the room looked so &quot;real&quot;, with depth and dimensionality I've never seen before on a television.You will not be sorry you bought this TV, it is in a class by itself.....
I read this many years ago, and this is the ideal 'starter' book for people interested in the subject, but aren't yet sold on the idea. I have read some books on past lives that romanticized too often on the subject. This book is a great read and entertaining even if you arent sold on the whole reincarnation idea.
I read this book many years ago and I was happy to read it again. Coulter has a way of getting you close to her characters. Lindsey was raised by a horrible father. Always treating her like an outcast and constantly putting her down and abusing her verbally. The biggest deception and hurt happened when she was 18 years old and raped and beaten by her sister's husband. Lindsey's father blamed Lindsey and claimed to the press that she was a slut and a Lolita. Finally several years later Lindsey discovers herself. She becomes Eden a famous model and meets the man of her dreams. And now someone is out to kill her. Is it her Father, who was disinherited by his mother and gave Lindsey/Eden all the fortune, is it her old professor from college who is a crazy, is it her sister, or her sister's husband, or is it someone else who wants her dead. Good surpise at the end. This book keeps you guessing.
There is no orignial tracks from Great White on this 2 disc set, but it is probably the best covers cd around. The First disc is a live concert of all Led Zeppeiln material recorded in 1996. The sound is incredable! Some tracks are better than the the mighty Zep themselves. The conclussion is much of the same with cuts that cover The Cult, Bob Dylan, Badfinger, Bad Company, and much more. I love this collection because of the variety of the music and it is all done by one great band(no pun)
I wrote a review for this movie when it first came out (2006) but I didn't think it did the film any justice. Here's a better and more appropriate review for 2010.This remake of THE HILLS HAVE EYES literally blows the original out of the water! Hands down, it's a million times better than Wes Craven's film. I've been a Horror movie fan for a very long time now and I can remember my disappointment with the Wes Craven original all those years ago in the 1980's. Much like Craven's LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, I felt his early films were over hyped at best. It wouldn't be until I watched his amazing NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET that I became a Wes Craven fan. Even after that film, his movie making career has been rather "hit or miss."Back in 2006 when this remake was announced, I was actually kind of thrilled about it because I thought the original could be improved upon. In the mid 2000's the idea of a remake wasn't totally over done yet (like it seems to be now) and the world of Horror seemed to be making a pretty good come back. With movies like THE DEVILS REJECTS, HOSTEL, SAW, HIGH TENSION and WOLF CREEK coming out, it would seem like Horror movies and Slasher films were getting their "guts" back.After watching THE HILLS HAVE EYES in theaters with my friends, I walked away deeply impressed! Years after watching this film multiple times on DVD, I'm still convinced it's one of the best Horror films from the 2000's era. Hands down, no questions asked. Even people who didn't normally enjoy Horror movies (maybe because of their predictability) seemed to be giving this amazing remake the attention it deserved. I can remember talking to one of my friends (who is normally hard to impress with movies in general) about THE HILLS HAVE EYES and even they found it to be shockingly good! This is the type of movie that leaves it's mark long after you've watched it.The story itself is pretty simple and unchanged for the most part from the original film. Basically it's about a typical American family traveling across the desert for their vacation. Things get complicated for them when they decide to take an unused road as a short cut and accidentally (or so it would seem) get into a car wreck. Stuck in the middle of the desert with no communication and no other options, it would seem like the only thing to do now is to walk through the hills and find some rescue. The Father of this family group decides to walk down one road while the husband of the oldest Daughter goes down another in hope of finding some help.Meanwhile, the rest of the family stays with the car wreck incase someone drives by the mostly unused road. As night starts to fall, strange things begin to happen. Somtimes it seems like there is someone or something watching them from the hills and strange noises are heard all around them. Eventually, one of the family dogs is found cut open and dead within one of the deep desert canyons. From this point on, the movie is kicked into high gear as mutant inbred rednecks sneak into their wreak site and begin terrorizing the helpless family members.What makes this remake work so well is the pacing and characterization. All of the actors do a believable and sympathetic job at drawing the viewer into the story. The family itself is very real with it's own personal problems and issues, some of which I'm sure the audience could relate to. Weather it's political differences between family members or just the basic sibling rivalry, the family presented here is very realistic.Another thing that makes this Horror film work is the use of brooding music. As the intensity rises with each scene, the music pulses away in the background like a heartbeat. It's a very "old school" Horror method, something that John Carpenter did years ago with movies like HALLOWEEN and THE THING. It's not a total throw back to the synthesizers used in the Cult movies of the past, but it's definitely a welcome addition to the already wonderful mix here. This is well done modern day film making at it's best. I've said it before and I'll say it again, music can literally make a movie.Gore wise, this movie doesn't miss a beat. The blood shed here is on the same level as the Tom Savini days of Horror. In other words it uses the classic blood and latex of the past, while using very little CGI in the mix. It's the perfect balance if you ask me. THE HILLS HAVE EYES isn't afraid to splatter around the gore and even make some of the main characters suffer in the process. Fingers are cut off, throats are ripped out and pick axes are used in all their gory glory! The rape scene in this movie isn't over done (although shocking as it is) and the revenge aspect is well balanced by the end of the movie. Gore Hounds, without a doubt, check it out if you haven't done so already! This is how a modern day Horror movie should be made!In the end, Alexandre Aja has made a near perfect Horror movie here. He's done a rare thing where the remake is actually a million times better than the original. After watching HIGH TENSION and THE HILLS HAVE EYES, I have come to the conclusion that he knows what he's doing as a Horror movie director. Even his lesser efforts like MIRRORS seemingly has a special craft to it. He's just a good Horror movie director.Some people might just consider THE HILLS HAVE EYES as another gruesome Horror film in the long line of modern day remakes and bad sequels. If that's the case for some people, then I would have to say they're missing the point here. Those are the jaded Horror fans who can't get into anything unless it's directly from the 1970's or the 1980's. To those people I would have to say your missing out.THE HILLS HAVE EYES remake is still the "best of the best" because it came out during a time when Horror movies were gaining ground again. It was a time period before all the sloppy remakes (NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and PROM NIGHT, I'm looking at you) and terrible "torture" Horror movie clones were coming out. THE HILLS HAVE EYES was a testimony to the ideas and originality of the next wave (or "new wave") of the 2000's Horror movie scene. In other words, it gets down to the basics and a return to form if you will. If anyone watches just one Horror film from this time period, let it be THE HILLS HAVE EYES remake. After all these years since it was released in 2006, I still think it's the best from that era.Horror fans in general, check it out. You won't be disappointed.I've said my bit.Over and out.
After years of wearing afros, braids, twists, weaves on and off for years...I'd decided that enough was enough and I was ready to lock my hair. I've read and purchased almost every book available on the topic of natural hair, from Tulani Kinard's &quot;NO LYE&quot; to &quot;LET'S TALK HAIR&quot; and &quot;FOR COLORED GIRLS...&quot; I was always intrigued by this book by Nekhena Evans but was put off by some of the negative reviews it received. Well let me tell you that those reviews are pretty accurate! I finally got to see a copy of the book at my locktician's salon and let me tell you ladies, it is simply not worth the price if you are looking for information on how to lock your hair! A more accurate title for this book would have been: COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT LOCKED HAIR, because that's all it is. Each chapter refutes myths about locked hair and the people who wear them. It contains very few pictures and the ones it does contain are small, grainy and black &amp; white. It poses questions such as &quot;Do people with locks wash their hair?&quot;; &quot;Should I use wax to help form my locks&quot;; &quot;Is hair essentially dead matter?&quot;, and more of the same info that most of us already know. If you are a person that has researched the style and want useful information on the pros and cons of different methods for forming locks, styling exisiting locks, proper care &amp; maintenance, photos of locked styles, correcting problems with developing locks, coloring locks, etc...you WILL NOT FIND THE ANSWERS HERE!!! This book is very short and can be read in less than a half hour. Some of the information is quasi-spiritual and shady on the facts. Honestly, I expected much more from the author since she has been a locktician for so long.
A few politically-oriented songs combined with poor musical skills make for an all-round funny album. Good for a laugh, but not much else.
I will first state that that I am a big fan of Regina Spektor, I just went to her show in Chicago on may 13th and her borders in-store on may 14th. Having had been to the show I must say the begin to hope is good but a bit of a disappointment when compared to previous college released efforts, live only songs, and her debut studio full length soviet kitsch. The tracks on begin to hope do still reflect Regina's unmistakable unique style but are a bit toned down from her usual songs and are a bit over produced. This album seems to have been made to attract more mainstream listeners. But I have to admit to being a bit bias because I'm not big fan of mainstream acts because when MOST acts become mainstream they lose a bit of them selves. I like most of the songs on this effort because I'm a big Regina Spektor fan but there are better songs on previous efforts. The only song I find complete unlistenable is 20 years of snow.The attacted ep disc is good as well. The stand out the ep is Dusseldoft and Music box. But I have to pose the question why make a regular album then a special edition. If you're a fan why would you not want the extra songs.
I ordered this Alsons head 2 years ago and it is a great head... all metal and solid construction. No plastic. However I just ordered it and received a head completely different from the one pictured and the one sent before from this same product page. The head sent was marked Delta and was all plastic. Upon speaking with the seller I found that Alsons was purchased by Delta at the end of 2011 and is no more.You can buy a Delta head at a fraction of the price of this head, which was priced for all metal construction. If you want all plastic, you can find a similar head in the $25-35 range.hope this helps.
I didn't expect very much when I picked up "Children of the Living Dead" from a supermarket's bargain DVD area. Was I ever pleasantly surprised!! I have seen much bigger budgeted horror films, with big-name casts that were far less entertaining than this film is. It is true that the acting is pretty much sub-par and sometimes even quite cheesy, but it tends to lend an unexpected touch of humor to the film, making it perhaps unintentionally campy at times. My main two complaints about the film are the limited role of Tom Savini, despite being given top-billing and his being the most interesting character in the film and also the idea of the "master zombie", "Abbot Hayes". It would have been much better to simply have had the dead start to rise and attack the living than to try to pinpoint one character that was the cause of it all happening. This worked very well in "Night of the Living Dead", where they never really explained what was causing the whole thing, but simply raised the question of the failed Venus probe space mission which may have been responsible. I really liked the young girl Laurie (played by Jamie McCoy), who was the waitress at Dave's Diner. She was the film's "nice" girl and I was also quite surprised at the film's lack of nudity and sex scenes. One more complaint though, the ending is somewhat abrupt and inconclusive, as it just leaves you hanging and wondering how it is all resolved. Still, although far from perfect, I can highly recommend it to zombie film fans. Not overly gory, but the make-up effects are excellent. The music by Alan Howarth also is quite good and adds much atmosphere to the film. Also, it really doesn't "look" like a low budget film, especially as I was simply just expecting it to be a shot on video cheapie, made for and released straight to cable t.v. and video markets. It is well worth a look, especially as it can usually be had for a song. It is really a fun film to watch!!
He was a great, history making tennis player. But far greater than that, Ashe was an extraordinary human being with keen insight into social issues who left a wonderful legacy for future generations to hopefully emulate. Great book.
Alfred Brendel is one of the world's most famous pianists, but not for reasons that make Argerich, Paderewski, or Rubinstein famous. Brendel is an expert both artistically and technically but he is not given to highly individualistic interpretations that rattle purists and create controversy. In other words, Brendel is a highly reliable pianist. Like Murray Perahia, there are no let downs in his recorded performances. For this and the price, no one should pass up this 2 disc recording.The only downside is the recording's track listing. Piano Concerto No. 23 is split: its first movement is in the first disc while its last two movements are in the second. Bewildering especially since the piano concertos are not sequenced chronologically. And the insert doesn't help. It does not explain the track arrangement (is it by the year of recording? by importance in Mozart's ouvre?). Nonetheless, there it is, Piano Concerto No. 23 separated into two cds. Why this has to be is difficult to understand. The first movement, allegro, is 11.04 minutes long; in the second disc, a one movement rondo, Rondo in A, KV 386, is 8.32 minutes long. Why wasn't this rondo placed in the first disc to allow a seamless playing of Piano Concerto No. 23?This is annoying if your player does not support multiple disc playing. I bought this 2 cd set specifically for Piano Concerto No. 23, whose second movement I love. It is one of the most sublime of piano adagios, up there with the second movements of Chopin no. 1, Rachmaninoff no. 2, Shostakovich no. 2. And I bought it specifically for Brendel's performance with the ASMITF, conducted by Neville Marriner. Brendel really makes the piano weep here. His evocations of a human's cycle of grief and redemption make the performance definitive for Piano Concerto No. 23. If the split won't bother you, do yourself a favor and get a copy.
I read for enjoyment and a few hours of being whisked away and caught up in someone else's life for awhile. I saw on Lifetime that a movie based on this book is to be on TV Saturday night so thought I would read the book first. I can say this was not an enjoyable book from start to finish. It will be interesting to see what the movie does with the book. None of the characters are very likeable with maybe the exception of Phoebe. ( I was a young mother in 1964, actually had a daughter born that year and do understand David's thoughts on a child with Down's but don't believe he was totally unselfish in his decision. However, many Down Syndrome children were put into homes to die at a young age many years ago but didn't think it was so much in the 60's. Today we are so fortunate to have programs for these wonderful children. Our neighbor boy has Downs and we watched him grow up and his parents work with him and the many programs available to him. He's a very productive young man and a delight. ) That said the book was terribly disappointing and just a very unhappy book. There is no redemption for any of the characters except maybe for Paul at the end. I disliked Norah's character immensely clear through the book. Even when David was trying to help her or just trying, she would lash out at him with hateful comments. Then there were all her affairs. I have zero tolerance for Infidelity and David didn't seem to care. She was a shallow, self centered person. I couldn't see her raising a child with a handicap. I am sure Phoebe had a happier life with Caroline. David was wrong in the choice he made but I could at least understand him for the time this happened in. Norah remarries at the end but I would have doubts of it lasting.The book was depressing at best. There is no happiness that I can see except that perhaps Caroline found someone to love and marry. However, even she seemed to have a lot of angst in her marriage that I felt came from her rather than Al. Interesting that Phoebe was happy with her circumstances and then Norah and Paul come into her life and want to change things. That would be frightening to a person with Down's. Paul's idea of moving to the same town and just spending time with her was fine but carting her off to France is just dumb. One thing I might add here, Down Syndrome children are not always pleasant and happy. They can be very difficult and angry. I've seen that often in our neighbor boy but they are also very loving children.Who wants to read a book that everyone is at odds and fighting through the whole book? I also got tired of hearing how thin Norah was and pages of the same thing of David's sister. How many times did we need to go into that? I found myself skimming a lot. I could understand David's character more than the rest; maybe due to his poor upbringing and the sickly sister and just the way things were handled in those days.I also agreed with another reviewer of Paul's long anger with his father. David showed him in so many ways he loved him and at one point told him he was proud of him and accepted and even encouraged his decision to go into music. I could have understood if he had been angry at his mother as he knew of her affairs but instead the author has it aimed at David. Made no sense to me.I also could not have sympathy for Norah with her years of grief for the baby she believes dies. Many women go through losing a baby and move on eventually. That was just an excuse for her disgusting behavior.I have read books on damaged people and eventual redemption but there just is no redemption in this book. It is just a depressing unhappy book. Charles Martin writes somewhat in this style of damaged people but inserts humor and redemption for them in the end. I will find a happy book to read now to get this out of my system. Why it is a best seller is beyond me. I'm not sure I even want to see the movie after reading this.4/14/2008 I wanted to add I did watch the movie and as much as I didn't care for the book, the movie is even worse. The acting was terrible and most of didn't follow the book at all.
Me being the avid vampire fan that I am, I'm always willing to read new vampire fiction. The librarian suggested this one to me so I thought I'd give it a shot.What a terrible read. I couldn't stand it for long, so I started skimming through the thing. Turns out the vampire in this book is an old guy, and he lives in a castle! What?! Any vampire fan knows that vampires roam the streets of upper middle class suburbia and high schools. Whoever this Bram Stoker guy is, it's quite clear that he doesn't know a thing on vampires, and his attempt to cash in on the vampire craze is indeed a failure.I'll be returning this on my next trip to the library and sticking to the teen reading section for finding my next vampire novel.(New Moon comes out November 20th, woooooo!)
A great read and one of the few books that I couldn't put down. I read it in two sittings and fans of the genre will be both amazed and spellbound by the imagry and details of a life that reads like a modern Ishmael in a sea of certian peril where the waters run deep and deeper.One should always be careful of what they wish for, as Corbitt might have said in any number of ways here; there is a price to pay for alliances, but you've got to admire a guy who has found his way through the maze of unregistered power and lived, so far, to tell the tale.
Given the other reviews and the age on the box, I was hesitant to get this for my 4 1/2 YO. But he loves Spiderman and he was so happy to get it. This game is too advanced for him, but the hints help him figure things out and he prefers to play this game with me. I give him more hints and take turns with him and he thinks it's great. However, I do think this cartridge would be more appropriate and fun for 6-8 YO.The game is very well done. I didn't like that all the games are "locked" until the child reads the story. But they only have to read the story once and it is a good story. As they go through the chapters the games open up. There are 5 games. The one where the green goblin surfs though the story and misspells words for the child to find is a little long, but again my 4.5 YO enjoys it, so probably an older child would like it even more. And the 4 other games on the cartridge are really cool. The makers of this game turned spelling into "code breaking", that's cool.Everything on the cartridge has an attractive, hip, video game like appearance. The Spiderman character looks believable. The voices on the cartridge do not sound like the movie ones, but they still fit the characters nicely. My teen will also sneak peeks at this game occasionally, so I know it passes the "cool" test. Since getting this game my son is starting to spell better - the educational element is definitely there.Highly recommended!
I'm 6 foot 1, my wife is 5 foot, and I have kids under 10. This is the best shower head to accomodate us all. I have had another one like this one for 10 years, and it still works great. A must buy!
This album was the first cassette I ever bought. I played it over and over for years. I can't think of another album with such mysterious dark themes to it, despite some of the more upbeat singles like "Life in one day". My personal favorites are probably "Dream into action" and "Automation".This album really captured the mid-eighties in a time capsule. No one to this day has used technology in pop music quite as well as Howard did on his first 4 albums especially this one. A-ha? Alphaville? Maybe, but it's good company. Probably not going to appeal to today's youth, you kind of had to be there in the time-frame to truly appreciate this music. I just wish they'd remaster this.Well it's now 2010 and Howard Jones has acquired the rights to this album and Human's Lib. He has remastered them both and issued a limited edition double CD containing those two albums. You might have to hurry, they are on his website. A bit expensive though.
I read this book several years ago and had forgotten. While I was reading, I felt like I was revisiting some old friends. The wife (Keely) of a MIA who after only weeks of marriage loses her husband for 12 years. For 12 years, she is loyal to her husband but discovers she's a woman with woman needs to be loved and cherished. No longer a child bride. She meets Dax, a congressman on the way up the political ladder. They fall in love and try to fight their attraction. In the end there is always a happy ending for Ms. Howard. I fell in love with Keely's best friend Nicole what a character. Once you finish reading this book you'll wish you had a good friend like Nicole.
For a while, I thought (hoped) this was going to be a large sweeping indictment of LA in the vein of what Bonfire of the Vanities did for New York City, but it's not even close. True, we get the huge contast between the obscenely rich and the destitute homeless, but the characters don't reach out and grab. Their comments don't stay. There are too many characters. Even as I was nearing page 549, I had trouble remembering who was who and who was related to whom.The best passages involve the lists of what the superrich can buy: their food items, the brand names of their household objects. The passages involving the poor are difficult to read because they're so graphic and squalid. Is this supposed to be a parody of Dickens? The orphan waif we have to love? The kindly rich who adopt the abandoned?The narrative voice is irritating and hard to take. He uses the word "chuff" too much (three times on page 320!). I got very tired of reading "he chuffed." And I can't imagine referring to the current Diane Keaton as a starlet. The smug and snarky asides to tell us we don't need to know what happens next are silly. How did he decide what to tell and what to omit...what to put in the text and what to relegate to the footnotes? At least half of the 549 pages could have been omitted. I didn't enjoy being assaulted by the stilted arch vocabulary that was more showoff-y than relevant. "The book is too long, too dull, and without a satisfying payoff," I chuffed.
Bob's red mill is generally the way to go for GF products. I first bought this at my local grocery store and tried it to make sure I liked it. I looked it here on Amazon and saw that I could save (a LOT) if I bought in bulk. My only worry is that I hope I can use it all in time.
This is one of those items you don't know you need until you own one. That makes it a great gift for someone who has everything--but just a regular coffee maker. Even most of the foaming coffee makers can't foam this high and creamy!Better yet, ditch those mega high calorie cappuccinos and lattes at the coffee shops and make your own light ones-- even with vanilla soy milk!Romantic dinner for two? You'll romance him or her BEYOND when you serve one of these with dessert--gorgeous, impressive, creamy, rich--- you could have store bought cake and this would still end the eve on a high note.Better yet, you can add in flavored coffee syrups--cocoa, hazelnut, vanilla, or serve with some cocoa mixed in and a candy cane to stir it with in winter or Christmas morn.I crave lattes and so I travel with this when I am away from home and can't go too long without a cappuccino or latte.I would have never bought this for myself but it's one of the greatest indulgence gifts I've gotten and always a successful gift to give as it's easy enough to use even if you can't boil water and you can make healthier frothy drinks at home than you can buy and it's love at first sip over sheer pampering.This holiday I'm gonna play with some hot cocoa lattes for the kids...
I am new into Laser sailing but not sailing in general. This book is great! It skips all the begginer stuff and dives right into the good stuff. This book explains it all. This book even has a large section of interviews with top laser sailers. They talk about the in's and out's of high performance laser sailing. This book is a must buy if you want to sail fast and have more fun with your laser!
This is a really good book. IMHO really good authors aren't only funny or only serious, but both because that's how real life is. Both Sam and Lucy are, in a way, caricatures - Lucy the former career girl panicked about her waning fertility, Sam the bewildered male who can't see what all the fuss is about - but they seem real and endearing through the "diary" format of the narrative.Without giving away any real spoilers, I'll say that I love the character development in this book - how Sam comes to share Lucy's desire to have a child, how both characters come to be more sympathetic to each other through the process, and of course the ending that illustrates that real love and forgiveness are possible.But good heavens, I really hope that if I ever want to have kids I'll prove fertile - this book really shows you all the hoops that reproductive technologies make couples jump through!
Programming Pearls is one of the very few books that looks at the problems that we as programmers all have, and keep on having day in and day out. It strives for solutions to problems that are compact, efficient and fast. It questions thinking and makes you think about programming.The book is comprised of a series of articles focused on a topic which you can read in any order you like. This is one of my favorite programming books, as I always find something 'new' just by browsing it. Unlike some other books on similar topics, the delivery of the information is concise and pallatable. I love this book.
This is clearly one of the greatest movies of all time. A national survey shows that more men remember the jump ship to Hong Kong scene that their wedding vows. Nothing can stand up to that. I am 13, so naturally some of my friends overly appreciate Happy Gilmore, which is, while good, nothing compared to the all around greatness of this movie. Yes, I am the youngster that truly appreciates Rodney Dangerfield more than Adam Sandler. By the way, this is also one of Chevy Chase's only movies where he truly portrays his talent.
Like this one better than his last one good cd Get it
A lord marrying an orange seller is as unlikely a Regency plot as I've ever seen, and yet...the interplay between these two characters kept me spellbound all the way through to the end. Of course, Harriet Treene isn't your average, everyday orange seller, and it isn't just her beauty that captures the heart of the broodingly handsome Lord Bonnington. Her courage and character, her intelligence, her witty repartee--yes, even her bold Cockney accent--make her the perfect counterpart for a lonely earl seeking purpose and meaning in his life.Okay, I admit that it's a bit farfetched that Regency society would accept an orange-girl countess, especially one that was widely known to be the earl's mistress before their marriage. But you know what? This is one of those love stories that everyone dreams of in their heart of hearts--even those stuffy old matrons who look down their noses at any girl dancing the waltz without their permission--and I, for one, am willing to suspend judgment in exchange for the most engrossing read in the last six months.
If you a fan of Superman comics you NEED to buy this .The story is parallel universe story as Superman lands in 1950's Russia instead of American how things would be totally different. The art is amazing and the story is deep and self contained. If you haven't read a superman comic in years you will not be lost. If your a kid this will have enough action for you, but it may be a little graphic. If you are an adult you will totally enjoy the political aspects and historical figures represented in this book.The deluxe edition has a great cover and some extra art at the end and looks great in any bookcase.
There are very few albums that I can hear over and over. This record is one of them. Adam got everything right on this one.The songwriting and arrangements are perfect (and rocking, fun and lively). And they perfectly suit Adam's lyrics, hang-ups and swagger. He's the ultimate showman/bandleader on Friend Or Foewhich contains loads of perfectly arranged horns, BIG drums as per usual and great vocal arrangements to boot.Friend Or Foe is his first album minus the Ants and the first where he receives credit for playing all the bass (something he did on the "Kings" and "Prince" LPs but credited them to Mooney and Tibbs, respectively). He's also is a pretty good rhythm guitarist and certainly knows how to use his voice (something never before fully displayed in the Ants).The Songs? Ahh, the songs. Friend or Foe contains his best batch of consistantly enjoyable songs (cohesively sequenced as well).The songs are alternately moody - the perfect "Desperate But Not Serious", "Here Come The Grump" - a song with an unwitting reference to AIDS (lines include "doctors say sex kills" and "come inside and die") and "Friend Or Foe" and UP.The perfectly swinging songs "Goody Two Shoes", "Place In The Country" , "Try This For Sighs", "Something Girls" and "Made Of Money" all make for a perfect soundtrack to an old-school swinging dance party. Way before the mid 90's swing revival mind you. There's also it's share of interesting songs "Man Called Marco" (which sounds like a theme to a spooky horror film that never was), "Crackpot History And The Right To Lie" the fine album outtake "Coup D'Etat" and the weirdly sexy and danceable "Cajun Twisters".The remastered cd has twelve(!) bonus tracks. Nine of which are rough home demos and are all in all pretty interesting. There's also the single version of "Goody Two Shoes" which is great and features Chris Hughes (aka Merrick) drumming and producing. There's also the excellent album outtake "Coup D'Etat" and "Good Sex Rumples The Clothing" which came out of the same sessions as "Juanito The Bandito" and "Why Do Girls Love Horses" and sounds it and has a great guitar part too.Weird thing is is that many lyrics on the album deal with Adam's critics and they all responded with rave reviews for this record. Rightfully so as this is one of Adam's finest albums (if not his best).The album also produced two American hits in "Goody Two Shoes" and "Desperate But Not Serious".
Why hasn't Christopher Scott Cherot acted since Hav Plenty? He is amazing in this film. I need more of that sarcastic, I don't care if you like me or not attitude. And the film itself is amazing. It is the first to manage to portray affluent blacks in a vast array. The characters reflect dignity. Sure there's some snobbishness, but it's discouraged throughout. The reluctant romance between Haviland and Lee are kept central, but humor dominates the film. Cherot is downright outrages. Chenoa Maxwell is a perfect cold-blooded stiff and Robinne Lee somehow manages to downplay her stunning beauty enough to pull of the little sister role. It's the characters and the dialogue, not a big budget that make this a must own. No clowny, cartoony buffoonery going on. It's just how we are. Colorfully diverse black people.
This is the first lesbian movie I have ever owned! Seeing is believing, owning is wow... much better! I watched it 3 times in one day I think, I couldn't get enough of it!
Keeping track of the secondary characters can be tricky at times.The big "stunning reveal" is leaked way too early in the book. Though it is nice how the characters find out what the reader already knows.I would love to know what happens to Torkel Fisk and Matthew Luzon. Oh well...
This is a campy collection of films, true, but a collection that provides a detailed look at a bygone era's increasingly futile attempts at quashing youthful rebellion.Unfortunately, seven of the twelve films here are &quot;condensed&quot;--i.e., edited to keep the DVD's running time under two hours and thus (presumably) keep the price affordable. This collection still provides much cinematic pleasure, though true edufilm fans should see the complete versions of such classics as MARIJUANA (narrated by a zonked-out Sonny Bono) and NARCOTICS: PIT OF DESPAIR (the only film here I actually saw in school; I never forgot the cobra scenes). At least the DVD presents the uncut version of the proto-Lynchian ABC OF SEX EDUCATION FOR TRAINABLES.Maybe Fantoma will release these films uncondensed on DVD someday.
This is a good introduction to both casting and pate de verre, well-researched and the authors obviously have a lot of hands-on experience. Don't be put off by the fact that it's a decade old; although some of the latest equipment and glasses won't be referenced the techniques don't change.
I bought this movie because I was told that some people thought the events portrayed were as real as believed when War of the Worlds aired. My response to that statement would have to be 'oh, gimme a break!'This film revolves around the news coverage of supposed asteroid strikes and evolves into possible alien contact. It's left rather fuzzy whether said contact was friendly or unfriendly but, in the end, it ends up not mattering in the least.The "news coverage" was laughable. It makes me want to see all the depicted evicts happen for real and get covered by CNN. ;-PThe saving grace of this movie was its ending when we're led to believe that we've been asteroided out of existence. At least I *think* that was the general idea. So there, planet Earth, take that!Want to snicker through the hour and a half or so of this mess? Go for it. It would be worth it if only to imagine such events really happening and how news coverage would really evolve. ;-)
Susannah McCorkle was always known as an artist who gave proper tribute to the great composers. She has a wonderful catalog of tribute CDs to composers of all types and this is one of the best.Diana Krall fans will immediately recognize two songs - &quot;How Deep is the Ocean&quot;, and &quot;Let's Face the Music and Dance&quot;. You will hear a more heartfelt treatment of these songs on this CD. &quot;Cheek to Cheek&quot; and &quot;Heat Wave&quot; are two other standards.One of McCorkle's strengths has always been to takle the seldom heard tunes and to make them very accessible. She is not content to sticking with the standards but forays into lesser known territory. With Berlin, she handles tunes such as &quot;Love and the Weather&quot;, &quot;Everybidy Knew But Me&quot;, amnd &quot;When You Walked Out&quot;.But the show stopper is &quot;There's No Business Like Show Business&quot;. Those who are used to the uptempo Ethel Merman version which is more a celebration of the joys of show business will be shocked when they hear Susannah's slow, and almost sad rendition. Rather than being a celebration, Susannah sings it as expousing the pain, agony, and heartbreak of show business, which is something she undoubtedly expereinced in her latter days prior to her death.One of Susannah's strengths had always been her ability to take a song, and give it its own interpretation so that the song became her own. She was a singer who was not afraid to take chances and to sing songs she believed in. Her love of her songs was always very apparent. She selected songs that meant something to her, in the way that she always meant something to us.
Very interesting book. Engrossing even, if a little short. I think I read it in two or three days which is pretty good for me. I guess no one has reviewed this because it's fairly rare. I didn't get it here; I got it from Strieber's site, but I won't name it here to be mysterious and also because maybe Amazon doesn't like that.This book is about a possibly not-so-chance meeting between some slight but extremely wise man and Whitley Strieber in his hotel room while he was on a book tour. The guy kind of just barged in apparently and spooked Strieber but just started talking and wasn't threatening. This book has that Strieber quality where you can't quite tell if it's non-fiction or not, although it is presented as such. I really am not sure but I guess I tend toward believing at least that what he's writing about occured on some level. He said right after it occured he called his wife and told her to make sure she would remind him later, if he doubted his own memory, that it wasn't a dream.It's hard to remember some of the things that the man said to him in the book, but Strieber does what some would consider a favor by simply presenting it as a dialogue between the intruder and Strieber. Not that he's not a good writer, but I think it was a good way to present it, because it makes you feel like you are kind of there in the action of the conversation (which consists of Strieber asking questions about the nature of reality, God, and such things, and the man responding) and also that you feel more what it was like to be in his situation during the meeting.This book is short enough that you may come away feeling you wish there were more to it, but for the most part it was satisfying to read and the type of book that a lot of people would read many times. It's also thought-provoking. That's one thing I forgot to mention-- to me it felt short but it also felt dense in the sense that a lot of dialogue and information were hitting you, while at the same time much of it made me actually stop and try to grasp something or think about it.If you're interested in aliens, long-lost advanced civilizations, and those types of alternate belief things, then I would recommend this. You could come away with a lot of questions but I'm not sure that's a bad thing. It could also possibly answer a lot of questions. This is the type of book where the ideas and answers that are presented may resonate with you or not. In other words, you would read it and you'd probably think that what was said either sounded like nonsense, or possibly a deep truth. It's a book that I'm somewhat proud to have in my collection.
How did I do without this all these years! Absolutely love how it works and the finished product looks like a new sweater.
The first time I saw this I died. Figuratively of course. This is an incredible performance that demonstrates the depth and breadth of Izzard's talent. I cannot tell you how many times I have watched it and every time I still laugh. In fact, he was on the other night on HBO and I still had to watch the whole thing.For those of you not familiar with him, Izzard is a transvestite who engages in a type of comedy that is more of a one-man show than a stand-up routine. While one might think that his tranvestism would be the main focus of the show, it isn't. While he uses it as a point of comedy briefly, the show really focuses on what it is like to live in this world. The show is a satirical look at cultures and history. He mocks nearly all western Europeans, and then reminds us that we native English speakers perhaps miss out on a whole view of the world because we are so constricted by our language. In addition, he also attacks law and politics and our American tradition of not knowing any world history.Yet, while his humor addresses pretty heady material, don't be fooled into believing that it is inaccessible or overwrought with discussion. This is not an NPR comedy special. This is bare bones hard humor that keeps you rolling in the isle each time you watch. My only regret is that it isn't available on DVD or VHS. Until then, go see it if you can in a theater. If you want something now, I would highly recommend Glorious, an earlier show done in England in which Izzard discusses the Bible. It is a classic as well. Let's hope whoever owns the rights to this wises up and realizes that there is money to be made.
Since I am post-menopausal I thought I'd really enjoy this book -I ABSOLUTELY did NOT! I found the main character exceptionally dull, and her friends sterotyped. This book was more about her friend's problem and emails about grandchildren rather than a REAL mystery.
Other than the power switch is not easy to see, the most issue with this microphone is the sound quality not that good. Use this microphone to record music for sure will disappoint you. Even using it for church meeting recording, you would not get excited for its sound quality.If you can tolerate the size of Sony ECM-MS907, you may like the sound quality of that microphone. If you like a small lapel microphone with true voice, try the AKG WMS-40 wireless system. Our people are much happier with the AKG wireless microphone than this one.
I spent a fortune on this remote and the damn thing never works.I cant get the things to upload...I cant get the website to work...If I do... the stupid REMOTE doesnt work.(and no its not just me- the TV setup guy couldnt get it to work either. DONT BUY IT!)
it has been a very long time since i have read such a superb novel. this author is truly excellent.i have never bored and always enthralled.
This is the first computer book I've read that actually starts from the beginning and explains *everything* about HTML that I ever wondered about! Most books expect some prior knowledge and leave a lot of information out, but this book really goes into a lot of detail explaining *why* things are the way they are, as well as *how* to do it correctly.It's also written in an engaging, lighthearted manner that made me want to continue to figure out what I was doing, even when things got difficult. There are a lot of photos, quizzes and puzzles and stuff like that to keep you interested. I know that sounds cheesy but the way they present it really works. I am so glad I bought it and I hope they come out with a lot more books like this one.
If Tell All Your Friends could be described with just one word, it would undoubtedly be "dramatic". Taking Back Sunday's Victory Records debut is emo-core at its most raw and powerful: imagine a soap opera on a cd. Filling the spaces between singer Adam Lazzara's disturbing gun references are decadently emotive lyrics about shattered friendships and-you guessed it-former girlfriends. Judging by songs like 'There's No 'I' In Team' and the break up anthem 'You're So Last Summer', one thing is certian: Taking Back Sunday is the center of their own universe. But don't jump to conclusions just yet. TBS's shamelessly self-centered lyrics are only half the story. Sure, Tell All Your Friends probably won't appeal to casual punk fans weaned on the Good Charlottes and Sum 41s of today's punk scene(TBS ranks among the hardest core of emo bands), but that comes with the territory of originality. The album is chock full of melodic guitar intros, edgy riffs, and screamo choruses. For fans of The Used and Thursday, TBS is right up your alley. My only main gripe with the album, is its short length. Paying full price for only a half hour of music can be quite irksome. All in all, TBS stands out as one of 2002's best indie punk records.
DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY GET SMART IT'S THAT OLD TRICK THE SLICK COVER IS HOW THEY WANT YOU TO JUDGE IT BUT YOU JUDGE SOMETHING ONLY BY IT'S COVER YOU WILL END UP TAKEING ONE UP THE U KNOW WHERE EVEY NOW AND THEN SOMETIMES THE COVER DOES TELL IT ALL BUT NOT THIS TIME ?THEY DONT EVEN SOUND HUMAN NO ONE WILL DANCE TO THIS EVEN ON CRACK... WELL MAYBE A FEW BUT THERE BUGGING.. .....AND THEY SOUND LIKE THERE IN LEAGUE WITH ....THE DEVIL-SATAN OUT TO STEAL ARE MONEY HEY CAN YOU SEND ME MY MONEY BACK PLEASEEEEEE'S !
Inspiring; makes you want to pick up a paddle and go somewhere. This would make a great book for middle schoolers because it's not on too difficult a level and the adventure will keep their attention. It's also a very innocent coming-of-age story that any parent would approve of. An adventure memoir completely lacking in sex and violence, the two boys ultimately discover their ability to survive through strength, perseverence, careful planning, and reaching out for help when needed.
I recently received this keyboard as a free replacement for another Logitech keyboard that developed a problem. Logitech does stand behind their products. This is a very well-designed and comfortable keyboard. Keys are quiet and responsive. The keyboard is noticeably smaller than the one that I previously had, and has some new and very useful features, e.g., you can open a picture file (in Picasa, for example) and enlarge or rotate the image with the click of key. The mouse is very comfortable and includes a USB mini receiver that allows it to be used with a laptop. It is the best of the many (at least 6) keyboards that I have owned over the past dozen years.UPDATE: The lack of a light to indicate when the caps lock is on is aggravating.
Just picked up 6 packs of these QuickLock connectors for my home theater system.The connectors are very sturdily built and are actually a bit heavier than I expected.Audio quality has improved slightly due to the good compression on the speaker wires and the tight fit to the back of my speakers and receiver vs. hooking the components up directly with speaker wire.The connectors could be a bit cheaper, but it's not really a big deal. You can find them cheaper on the internet, but I refuse to do business with some of those places (RitzCamera, ANTOnline, etc.). Just read the reviews and you'll know what I'm talking about.
I really like the WMF line of kitchen utensils. They're attractive, easily cleaned (dishwasher safe), and made of 18/10 stainless. With few exceptions, I also find their designs to be the most functional (for tongs, go with Rosle). This particular strainer doesn't allow any liquids to get trapped when you pick up the food.Knocking a point off because they're made in China. I would gladly pay more to see Germany stamped on the metal, rather than a China sticker.
blizzard has added new twists to the warcraft theme. it is not a simply more campaigns to fight but little games within the game.
Up to this point Mormons seem to have been universially unable to accurately express why their mission was the single most defining time in their lives. There have been several attempts ranging from the saccharine-like tales of Jack Weyland to the more confrontational &quot;Fires of the Mind.&quot; The task is difficult because it involves conflict and resolution in many different dimensions: spiritual, physical, intellectual, and emotional. God's Army comes the closest to explaining why a Mormon mission becomes a pivotal point in one's life.Here the writer/director takes a little literary license. Whereas in real life the conflicts usually come as one proselytes, in this film problems arise mostly from the interactions of the other district missionaries. This district is populated by all the classic archtypes: the elder who is extremely sick, but won't let them send him home; the worldly elder; the elder whose family are all outside the church; the &quot;intellectual&quot; elder; the elder and sister who meet and get married after their mission; the straight-lace elder who has all the right habits; and so on. I saw many of these types, but never in the same district.Not just the &quot;types,&quot; but the actions seem very familiar: the pranks (even the slightly gross ones), the fighting, the elder who leaves the church, the elder who dies, and the discouragement.But you also see the fruits of this labor: the people who are touched by the spirit, the baptisms, the spiritual growth experenced by elders and contacts. This also rings true to someone who has served a mission.There are some things protrayed in this film that seem a bit harsh, such as the &quot;Mission President Interview,&quot; but I took this as an attempt to increase the conflict aspect of this story. There are some things that are a bit unrealistic, such as the &quot;Baptism in the Ocean,&quot; but I interpreted this as an attempt to make the &quot;success&quot; even more ideal.The one thing this film wasn't able to capture was the utter monotony, the day in and day out experiences. But I consider that to be an issue dealing with the medium, not the writer/director.Basically I feel that this is the best attempt, up to this point, to explain why a Mormon Mission is so important in so many lives.
it's great for phone numbers, calendar entries, tasks, it syncs with Outlook. the only fallback is that it doesn't store addresses of people. that's very annoying!
If you like Joop or Wings then there is a 99% chance that you will like Touch. Touch is NOT the same as the above 2 products but it is Not spicy in any way. The Cool Water by Davidoff is somewhat similar with the exception that the initial fragrance quickly disipates tnd before you can even say "I'll buy that!" there is the overwhelming aroma of spice.Everyone laughs at OLD SPICE but it seems that almost all of the mens fragrances are retreads of the same "the only fragrance in the world is spice or MORE SPICE or SWEET AND TRIPLE THE SPICE!!!!"Although I love JOOP I end up wearing TOUCH much more often in the past year.
I've read 6 of his books so far and I thought this one was pretty good. Not the best, I liked the Vig the best. This book held my interest, although I skipped over some wordy pages, but the overall story and suspense was good. A very surprising ending. I would recommend it.
Bought it last night on the way home from work.. great game! Couple maps, lots of different playing options (different skill tests which are a blast). Graphics are exactly like the arcade, play is the same, and after a little confusion at the beginning I got used to the controls. Of course a steering wheel would be better, but I won't complain.I noticed a few slowdowns when sliding into multiple cars, but the same slowdown was in the arcade, so I think it's something that'll always be present. Anyways, definately lived up to the hype, great game.
It's sad that so many good films about the stupidity of Bush II's Iraq War has not succeeded at the box office, and in a way, this applies to "Grace is Gone" -- though this film is about the human beings that war affects -- and it is a VERY affecting film. Cusak continues to impress me as an actor, and the two young actresses who played his daughters are fine performers. Watch this one. Beautifully done.
As of November 2009, I have owned this camera for several years and I am -- well, I WAS -- very happy with it. About two months ago, it started eating batteries. I install fully-charged batteries and within 24 hours, with the camera turned off and not in use, the batteries are dead. I've tried several different sets of batteries with the same result. Can't figure out the problem and I don't want to send it back so Sony as I'm certain it would cost more to repair than a new one. In fact, I think I'll buy a new or used one.
The interesting thing is that I walked out of the theater thinking this was a four star movie, but when I bought the DVD and watched it again, the little nagging questions I had leaving the theater got bigger and I was left wondering what happened. I agree with what a previous reviewer said about Lucas making the movie HE wanted, not necessarily what the short attention span audience wants. That's what happened here. The compelling back story to the wonderful original Trilogy is waiting to be told, but instead we are given endless action sequences that completely gloss over the story. One example is why is someone trying to kill Amidala? Ok so the Trade Federation wants to get her. Ooh, nice motive. Actually, in one of the deleted scenes, Amidala actually gives a speech before the Senate urging them not to create an army of the Republic. Lucas' comment was "Well, we needed to move things along, so we just cut it out" Well George, moving things along you missed developing the story. In the scene's place we have Jar Jar proposing that they create an army. Huh? I'm confused.And that's not all. The love story between Anakin and Padme seemed forced as well. I felt like it was the stormtrooper in Episode IV telling us to "Move along" "Nothing to see here, keep moving" Also, how does someone go from being a typical teenager to being the most nasty and evil guy in the galaxy? The transition wasn't made in this film. I personally don't see how Lucas will be able to make this transition in Episode III.The bottom line is that I am really disappointed. This Trilogy had the potential to be greater than the first, alas George Lucas opted to take the same route that video game makers have taken. Provide stunning visuals with little substance.
In 1969 this album was issued, and had very little info as to who played on it, nor did it have little more than a song listing. Originally issued by White Whale, this reissue has some information and lots of notes. OF COURSE - THE MUSIC. This album is loaded with effects and, for the day, decent production. The album symbolizes life and death in a musical setting. Of note is the backwards tapes on "Fly" - a possible hit single (White Whale issued "Break of Dawn" as the single off of this LP). For collector's this is a must have.
I was looking for a means of transport and quick set up for my stompboxes, and the SKB PS45 Pedalboard definitely meets my needs.The construction is solid and the hardshell case keeps my pedals safe while being dragged from pillar to post.The power supply does away with the wall-wart adapters for most of my effects, and the patchbay helps me save on setup time.I recommend it highly.
Monofader is a collaboration effort between Sebastian Komor (Icon of Coil) and Richard Bjoerklund (Spektralized). Frost has a dark synth-pop vibe, but yet an agressive groove. I would say it's a little on the gothier side. Mimic and Scars, more anthem-like, are probably my favorite tracks, but there are plenty of other catchy songs that are a nice blend of Darkwave, Futurepop and EBM. The album is a mixed bag of slow and upbeat tunes. Random thought: I hear a definite Cabaret Voltair influence.If you like synthpop or futurepop, you should probably add Frost to your collection. EBM fans may like as well, but I suggest you take a test listen first.Cheers!
For many of us, the teenage coming out, coming of age story has been done again and again, but Blue Gate Crossing is a sweet addition to these kinds of storylines, with the added interest of being set in Taiwan.Meng Kerou (Lun-mei Guey) and Lin Yuezhen (Shu-hui Liang) are best friends and high school students in Taipei. Yuezhen has a crush on Zhang Shihao (Bo-lin Chen), a boy in their school, but it's Kerou who goes to talk to him on Yuezhen's behalf. Shihao thinks it's Kerou who likes him, so things become a bit of a mess when he begins to like her. At the same time, Kerou is realizing that it's Yuezhen that she's fallen in love with.It's a very innocent story of young love. Shihao becomes a good friend to Kerou too. He's the kind of boy who's very sweet and likable and a big part of making this film work. Yuezhen, on the other hand, lives in a sort of fantasy world and chooses to ignore it when Kerou kisses her. Kerou's heart breaks, but she ends up happy and more sure of herself and her sexuality, regardless of Yuezhen's reaction.Nominated for Best Asian Film at the Hong Kong Film Awards.
I understand that movies such as Osama do not appeal to everyone's taste. First off, people who lack the attention span to absorb all of the subtle details of the film will not enjoy this movie. Secondly, the people who dislike the Bush administration will not enjoy this movie because the story is overshadowed by the immense expression of American viewpoints in the Afghanistan situation.We have to understand that we cannot watch a movie such as Osama through the perspective of an American - more importantly an American adult. Thus, I feel the director purposely centered the movie's story around the perspective of a 12-year old girl to reflect the innocent thoughts of children and their unhindered views of the environment around them. Moreover, the director effectively, honestly, and powerfully conveys the repression caused by the Taliban in Afghanistan (mainly among women).Osama's slow moving pace can be justified because human emotion requires a longer time frame to develop than mere plot. The illustration of the complex situations that the 12-year old girl faces throughout the movie are incomplete without a general understanding of how those situations affect her. For example, the director takes great pains to film the actress returning home from her work (disguised as a boy) to show the danger involved as well as showcase her vulnerability and apprehension. All the subtle details about the dog and the mysterious man following her add to the paranoia of the situation.As I said earlier, Osama is not everyone's cup of tea. Those who do enjoy the movie will find that it is truly an engaging film that has a lot to say about society in Afghanistan. Others may find that its subtlety is tedious and pretentious. However, do not completely discredit this movie. Either way, you will leave the movie having learned something about Afghanistan or at least be impacted in somehow.
Daxter is one of the most fun games ever made, and it was designed for the PSP so it plays incredibly well. It starts out a little slow, but I didn't want it to end. The levels are HUGE, and there is a zero load time engine that almost eliminates load times... almost...Its part adventure, part shooter, has humor, innovative levels and puzzles,there is even a hot elven chick with big hooters.Simply an amazing game, its like a contemporary Mario 64.
Great album, fantastic sound. Bass lines are incredible and the vocals are incredibly unique. Many are calling this &quot;punk rock, but ah, if they only knew. In the words of Calibretto, &quot; Punk rock is dead.&quot;.This is definatly a great investment
While laid up at home unable to go out, my wife's birthday still needed attention. The Old World Charm basket pleased my wife in every sense. While the portions of eavh item are predictably small, all are high quality and came in a tastefully put together gift basket.
The used car smell is not as appealing as the new car smell. This seems to help with the smell.
This is one of the most visually pleasing games I have ever played. I don't usually like jumping games, but for this game I've made an exception. The game is quite surreal, and very dark. The toys (read weapons) Alice uses are very imaginative, and if you don't move Alice for a while she'll run an animation associated with the toy she's currently wielding. It's Alice in Wonderland for grownups. You can't beat the price, so if you have the system to run it, buy the game.
As far as music that moves you goes, yeah...it's all about some Thrice. This album never really slows down except a few parts, but that's okay because they're great too. Nice little elements of punk, hardcore, and emo throughout the whole thing. And their anger is refreshing too, because it isn't the same angst...you've heard before. Oh no, it's Thrice. Buy it.
When I first picked up the book, I flipped thru it and discovered that it was full of futures charts and discussions on futures related issues. I primarily trade stocks and options but there was a section on market psychology that looked pretty good so I started reading....The more I got into the book, the more I liked it. The Market Psycholgy section was excellent so I kept going. The discussions of the 7 interday indicators was right on and very helpful. The setups that he used in his discussions made sense. I related to a lot of the examples and discussions that the writer used and liked his writing style. He primarily trades futures but gave some great trading analysis and ideas that could apply to both stocks and futures. He also walks you thru the "switchover" to futures from stock trading if you choose to. After reading hundreds of investment books, I was surprised at how many "fresh" ideas and specific setup ideas were in this book. It's like discovering a new tool to take you to the next higher level of understanding. I know that sounds "hokey" but I am quite impressed with the content of this book.To conclude, this isn't a generic beginners guide to investing. It is focused and packed with varsity level information. I learned more from this book than the last 50 books I've read on day trading and assorted investment strategies. It is now one of my top 5 favorite investment books of all time.
What sort of people would open their first album with something like Dead Flag Blues.....Think about that.The first thing that we the public should hear is this haunting,bleak sound poem about &quot;the end of days&quot;.What an absolutely stunning and audacious thing to do. Here then is the Godspeed manifesto.Although this is not as musically adventurous as the later &quot;skinny fists&quot; when we arrive at the point 16 minutes into the final track Providence and we are asked &quot;Where are you going&quot; It is a fundamental question and a moment of real truth.Once you play this music in a room...that room can never be quite the same again...something will be different.Five stars...HIGHLY recommended.
Steve Kuhn has played strong, individual music for his entire career. There are no known recordings of his days playing with Coltrane.... but this early work is in some ways his best. It burns with the flames of youth and inspiration, and all the players interact at an incredibly high level. None of them found such "stardom" that their talents by rights should have earned them, which says more about marketing, narrowmindedness, and the pathetic need to be cool (followers) of the jazz audience, than it does about music.But this music shines brightly, 37 years on, and perhaps there are now ears to hear it, after the soporific Geo. Winston, and the solipsistic K. Jarrett (and their marketers) have persuaded audiences to sit still and listen for those overtones that hover above a properly maintained piano in the hands of a competent pianist on a good night.And Steve Kuhn is way more than competent.
I KNOW MOST &quot;WANNA BE&quot; PAC FANS WILL NOT LIKE THIS BUT IF YOU ARE TRUE TO HIM YOU WILL LOVE IT. IT IS THE ALBUM THAT PAC WOULD HAVE TELEASED IF HE HAD NOT DIED RIP. THE SONGS ARE TIGHT AND THE WHOLE ALBUM IS TRUE PAC TO THE CORE. EVEN THE COUNTRY SONG IS GOOD TO LISTEN TO SO BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This loaf pan is good quality. I've had it for a while and it's finish has not scratched. It cooks evenly and browns well. The extended border makes it easy to grasp when removing from a hot oven. I cook meatloaf and bake bread in it.
I honestly wish I could say that "Bear City" is not your typical indie gay comedy--and indeed some elements of the film differentiate it from most of the other gay indie comedies that seem to sprout up like toadstools these days. But those very elements that distinguish this film--the focus on bear culture, the bashful twink who "comes out" as a bear-lover, and the depiction of love and sex among gay men who do not resemble Abercrombie & Fitch models--are so thoroughly transformed into standardized gay tropes that the movie is ultimately stripped of its originality and settles into a formulaic, plot-less pattern of mildly amusing vignettes with no real focus or story structure. We are ultimately left with vapid platitudes assuring us that bears don't need to conform to queer norms of beauty in order to find love and happiness. And it takes them only 90 minutes to deliver this profound and provocative message (YAWN).
I cook a lot, and and very picky about knives. This one's a winner! If I could only have one single knife in my whole kitchen, it would be this one. The big curved handle fits my (average male) hands really well. The blade is the right size and has the right amount of curvature. There is plenty of weight and an almost totally rigid blade (doesn't flex more than you'd want). And most importantly, the thing sharpens up like a sword. After I hand-sharpened it, guests who use this knife tell me they find it almost scary how sharp it is. And it stays sharp with very minimal maintenance. This knife is the best for all-around cooking. (For more delicate, super-precise cooking, try the Wusthof Asian Cook's Knife instead.)
Lovewrecked, a film from 2005, lasts around 90 minutes and is a pretty enjoyable entertaining film starring Chris Carmack from The OC. Amanda Bynes plays Jenny who ends up supposedly stranded with her pop star idol, played by Carmack. It's a funny film with quite a few comical incidents and the ending wass preety reasonable.Not too bad a way to spend an hour and a half.Enjoy.
The user interface for the Brittanica has gotten worse in every year since the first CD-ROM version was isssued. Too many bells and whistles, all of them amiguously named and idiosyncratic in operation. The current version has irritated me so much that I unistalled it and went back to using the 1997 version, which has a very simple interface using Netscape 2.0. The material the encyclopedia provides is still excellect, but it is very difficult to find what you need.
I first casually watched this series as an alternative to being bored with expectations set at the moderate bar. As you might have guessed I was blown out of the water and into the pews by the quick to anger Father Jack. George Whitefield may have jerked tears from his audience with his eloquence in the Great Awakening, but Father Jack captured my laughter and attention with his drunkeness and hilarious antics. Stealing most every scene from Fathers Ted and Dougal, I found myself so enthralled by him that I call the series with my friends &quot;Father Jack&quot; and eagerly await series two and three. Well done. Praise Jesus
I had a gas powered pressure washer that was a real nightmare to start and I had to deal with gas, oil and winterizing the thing.I finally had enough and bought the PWS1750 and what a joy to use. Although the last washer was rated at 1900 psi, I can not tell the difference in power. This is relatively quite and a press of a button and you're ready to go. I wish I would have gotten this first.

If Francis Coppola had had any guts, he would have behaved as gracefully as Frankie Pentangeli. When this thing was in the can, he would have had a quiet party with family and friends, then gotten into a warm bath and opened his veins.
The rest of the reviews on this page are for Tomita's Bermuda triangle - yet this is not that album. It is a strange rock album. Amazon needs to sort this issue out - is Tomita's album available?
I hate Alec Baldwin. Maybe it's all that hair, or all that ego. But, either way, this movie could have survived without him. I bought it anyway, because of the racy subject matter, and the girl looked damn cute. OK movie. Appears to be kind of predictable, when you see where it's heading, but the Tease/Cupcake wins, and the Predators lose.
I stumbled across the original '81 release of 'The End of Asia' as a teenager knowing it was Sakamoto but not much else.. I was enthralled from the first moment.This new release contains 50% previoulsy released & 50% new material. The mastering is very impressive. The presentation in an LP style sleeve [mentioning sides 1 & 2] with insheets, and a plastic vinyl bag for the CD is a nice touch. This new release was never issued on vinyl - the packaging is a reference that anyone who bought old Sakamoto or YMO vinyl will appreciate [they were all packed this way].The title track alone is worth the price, listen and you'll long for a fair maiden's hand to guide through a medieval court dance.Cherished highlights from the original CD are here too, including some sympathically & knowledgably composed Sakamoto tunes like 'Dance' which show that the man has a true appreciation of period music.Istampitta Isabella has been, and always will be, a favourite of mine.. and 2 Rondes is a wonderful end to the album.If you like this CD then check out the album 'Beauty' - also by Ryuichi Sakamoto - for it's wonderful interpretations of 2 Okinawan folk songs 'Asadoya Yunta' and the beautifully emotive 'Chinsagu no hana'.
I've had this album since it came out on the yellow vinyl in 1973, so I knew the music would be good. This is one of Grand Funk's best works, but I only gave this CD 4 stars instead of 5.I was a little disappointed with the sound on the original album cuts. Since it is a remastered CD, I thought the sound would be better, but I found that I have to really punch up the bass and treble to get the best sound here.The sound quality is better on the bonus tracks. The acoustic version of Stop Lookin' Back is outstanding, not quite what you'd expect from GFR, but really showcases Farner's acoustic guitar skills, something you don't get to hear very often. Hooray and The End are good songs, but I'm not sure why they even added the 2002 remix of We're An American Band, it is lifeless and anemic compared to the original 1973 version.
For a book that costs about $14 and covers 52 behaviors in toddlers, you can't go wrong. For other behaviors you will encounter during your toddler's stage, you can extrapolate. I think Jana Murphy's choices are great, and the questions are nicely organized in logical chapters. While some readers criticize this book for being lightweight, I think that it's just the right amount of reading for those of us who have no time for reading anymore.What is also convenient about this book is that Jana Murphy gives you a little "now that you know" at the end of the behavior Q&A; and tips on how to handle potential problems. This is a practical little book with no frills, and I think the author accomplishes her goal.If you are looking for a "deep" toddler psychology or a textbook fit for a graduate seminar on toddlers, then you need to get Socioemotional Development in the Toddler Years: Transitions and Transformations (August 2007), a $55 tome that you can pore over.
Harrison in his introductory notes (2000) to this collection states, "I would like to liberate some of the songs from the big production that seemed appropriate at the time.." Well my thoughts exactly...And there is a bit too much in your face Vedantic lecturing..I remember listening to my sister's copy of this album when it first came out...it was in the gray Portland rain and I wondered about time, space and the perfect red lips at the time ...My impression at the time was, there are several really good songs here but this is not an album I would listen to over and over...So in putting on the headphones (tonight) and zeroing in on this version, I feel pretty much the same except this could have been the best of the post Beatles albums...The big production numbers by way of Phil Spector are way too much-- often sounding like a mix of George Martin and an East Indian Kazoo on coke...too much going on that just drowns the songs..Course "My Sweet Lord" is still uplifting and vibrant...Dylan's "If Not For You" begins to liberate the album...But what makes you realize how good this coulda been are the outtakes that were not overly drenched in this crazy schlock...For instance on "I live for You" Pete Drake's steel guitar just resonates with celestial wings...So if Spector was not there and a couple of the overtly in your face songs were deleted, this coulda been a stellar album...Thank God for the outtakes, some of which are instrumentals that rock with Eric Clapton's guitar work...George was an extraodrinary artist...his playing still resonates yesterday, today and tomorrow...
They weren't too bad when they were new, but after a year they are horrible. They've taken all the joy out of listening to music.
I Dream of Jeannie is a very fun watch, especially this season. It was very entertaining with some good plots. I felt though that the order of the episodes made no sense. I have a gripe with two episodes: Here Comes Bootsie Nightingale and Jeannie Goes to Honolulu. Here Comes Bootsie Nightingale was OK, but the actress could have been WAY better. The thing I really don't like is that the picture seems to be bouncing from 12:00-16:00. This is very irritating. Jeannie Goes to Honolulu must be the WORST EPISODE of the whole series. Nine whole minutes of the episode were of a stupid Don Ho music video. I hate to speak ill of the dead, but the song picked was awful. The video was so annoying. It was of Don Ho just walking around holding a boys hand with Jeannie dancing annoyingly in the background.My advice is to get a VHS of the Bootsie episode, then put it on your computer. Also, copy all the episodes to your computer. Use it to make a new order of episodes using the VHS version of Bootsie. A good episode order would be:1. Jeannie or the Tiger2. Fly Me to the Moon3. My Turned-On Master4. Jeannie, the Hip Hippie5. Everybody's a Movie Star6. Who Are You Calling a Jeannie?7. Meet My Master's Mother8. Operation: First Couple on the Moon9. Haven't I Seen Me Someplace Before10. Jeannie and the Great Bank Robbery11. My Master, the Ghostbreaker12. My Son, the Genie13. The Second Greatest Con Artist in the World14. The Battle of Waikiki15. My Master, the Weakling16. Genie, Genie, Who's Got the Genie? Saga (4 Episodes)17. Please Don't Feed the Astronauts18. Have You Ever had a Jeannie Hate You?19. Divorce Jeannie Style20. Here Comes Bootsie Nightingale21. My Double-Crossing Master22. Tony's Wife
I read this book ages ago, and since I can remember it's been considered a masterpiece worldwide. It seems like in some places a celebrity's blessing is needed to get the attention of those who instead of reading good literature are connected to the television watching crappy stuff. Well, if you fit the glove, then don't even bother leaving a review, carry on watching your stuff and leave the reviews for the ones who really enjoy good literature.
I really like the design of the clock. The first clock came and it read "Baby Tim". I sent it back for a replacement. When the second clock arrived everything looked okay. When I put the battery in and tried to set the time the hour hand just flopped down. I am not going to try again. I requested a refund and am disapointed that this clock did not work out for our nursery.
This book is a hilarious look at what most girls go through as they transition from girl to woman. We form &quot;clubs&quot; wherein we are idiots who have adventures. I'm sure all of us could add a chapter or two in the same vein.
Why is everyone saying Green Day wasn't recognized until Dookie?. I loved them because of Kerplunk and i still do, I'm surprised i haven't worn out the Kerplunk tape i listened to it so much and its still so great. Just because MTV didn't become obessed with them until Dookie means nothing. Also everyone has been saying the new album isn't punk and i was mad at first but i think they are right. It doesn't matter, i still like it but not the way i like Kerplunk. I don't see why they have to be punk to be good, it seems like some people are saying that just because it has a differant name it sucks. Anyways Green Day is still punk if these people were to talk to them they would know. They have a good life now, they are married and have kids and they don't need to sing about girls and school and drugs anymore. I really like the message behind warning. I think that its their best in that respect; its honest. If you are a Green Day fan I bet you will still like this, it's differant but it still is Green Day and it still is GREAT. If you aren't a fan yet and liked some of the songs, especially from Nimrod you will love this album. It is great to just sit back and listen to it. Oh, their LP for this album is cool too, its GREEN! Check that out too.
I was just perusing these at a sporting goods store where they are priced at $12.95 each. (Exact same ball, Rawlings Official MLB. Each comes in its own clear plastic cube sealed with an MLB hologram sticker. Dazzling.) I balked at purchasing because they offer no discount on a dozen, then I thought I might get a better price at Amazon plus not have to package it and stand in line at the post office (it's for a gift). I am surprised to come here and find the price 65% higher ($21.45 as I type this)! Back to the sporting goods store for me.
Like the swing of young Timmy, so is the prose of his creator. Coyne's novel is not really about gentlemen, it's not really about games. Nevertheless, if you've ever played golf, read this book. If you've never played golf, and wondered why the hell any sane person would, read this book. If you've ever been a son, read this book. If you've ever had a father, read this book. If you've never had a father, read this book. In short, if you never read anything else in your life, read this book.
This book, first published in 1979, was based on a doctoral dissertation Raymond wrote. Because she tells the truth about people who go through surgical mutilation and being pumped up with hormones in order to be fake men or fake women, obviously many from the transgender community take offense. Those who are male-to-female, the major focus of the book since that is far more common than female-to-male, simply think that because they have this surgery and wear women's clothing and act out a stereotype, that they ARE "female." But they aren't, and they never will be, and they can never understand the experience of being female in a male-dominated society since they were never born female. They are in fact dysfunctional or deviant males, as Raymond writes, and they are rebelling against a male stereotype by trying to act out a female one. These transgendered people believe that the gender they were born was the "wrong" one and that they were living a "lie" until they had surgery when in fact they are living a lie now. I am glad Raymond wrote the book and only wish she would update it. The truth does hurt.
I fell in love witih this book. It was found by the grace of God at Barnes and Nobles bargin bin for 6.98. I would have brought it for 10.00. It caught my eye and inner spirit when I read the first few pages while browsing it at the starbucks cafe area. I and my oldest son, 19 have the same personality so I let him breeze through it to get his take. He said mother I like this kind of book. We were similiar in emotions, quick to be perfect, people pleasers, christians that think to hard about why this happened and what can I do to be happy. Well this book give you brief fast solutions that make sense and are doable. I love the quotes and stories. It's not too short and not too long. I even brought a stuffed happy animal from the bargin bin that matches the book color. I put both on my nightstand. My whole family back home is getting a book to share and pass around. They whine alot and complain about simple petty stuff. I love this book!!! Thank you so much. The words are food to my spirit and mind! Thanks forever M.J. Ryan. I am different at church, work and home. God Bless You All!
I loved this game! It was thoroughly engaging from beginning to end. It has just the right combination of strategy, action, and humor. I have to laugh at the earlier reviewer knocking the nudity: the only way to get the nudity is to download a hack that specifically says what it does. Besides it is only partial nudity and was only in the 'mermaid' section of the game and it is tastefully done.
The Watcher's Guides are good books, but you should know a few things before you buy volumes one and two as a set. (1) On Amazon, the books are cheaper separately. (2) The two volumes cover only the first four seasons of the show. There is now a third volume that covers seasons 5 thru 7. (3) There are other guides by different authors that cover more than four seasons in a single volume. (I think "Dusted" by Lawrence Miles and the newest Buffy guide from Keith Topping cover **all 7** seasons.)
This is a cheaply made sprouter. The lid disintegrated after less than a year's use; and the little flanges inside the containers get clogged regularly. There are much better designs out there!
Having seen Zumanity since I saw Varekei I am reminded again of how much I love this show! Sitting in Reve Rouge the last nite they were in Chicago I held my breath the entire show. So well put together the acts blend toghether seamlessly. I do have to applaud the music which I have been listening to non-stop. It really sets the mood for the beautiful job the artists do. By far the best Cirque show out there, DVD is worth it with all the extras, but the show is best live!
I bought this product after thorough research and sending back another product that was just too large to carry easily.If you are a magician, clown, or belly dancer, or some other kind of party entertainer this is the perfect portable, all-in-one durable piece of equipment on the market at this time for dragging to gigues. The guitar amp is also for large pin microphone and has a mixing knob (thus it does Karaoke: you can sing with the music). You will not find this in any other description, not even JVCs. I had to buy the product to see what it really can do.It has no-nonsense buttons, you don't have to read the instructions to operate it and the sound is clear and LOUD.A great item for the investment, I think I can will it to my kids.
Wow! What a story Mr. Roberts tells, based on his life as an escaped convict from max. security prison in Australia, posing as a doctor/healer in the slums of Mumbai, dealing drugs and then other illicit trades, fighting alongside the mujaheddin in Afghanistan in the 1980's, and joining the Mumbai mafia. Each step of the way, he has words of wisdom and redemption. However, he and his editor have overindulged his tendency to ramble a bit. This book was over 900 pp, but I still stayed up day and night reading it until I finished it. Bravo, Mr. Roberts!
Im sorry But I thought this movie was hilarious actually I watched it with my sister molly and we were laughing every minute. until the end that got kinda sad but Hayden Christiansen was hilarious and Kevin Kline was funny. rent this movie you get a combination of Drama and a few laughs
This book is absolutely essential for anyone with MCS, and especially those new to having MCS.What it does best is explores the emotional and social issues surrounding having a 'non-legitimised' disease, and a disease that one cannot keep private or keep from affecting others around you. It does this especially well.I would also recommend it to my fellow M.E. (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis) patients, as they face many of the same emotional, legal and social issues, as well as having symptoms of chemical sensitivity to a mild-severe extent (along with equally bad or most often far worse - compared to our level of chemical sensitivities, which is most often far less than someone with severe primary MCS - neurological, cognitive and cardiac problems exacerbated by exercise or even mild activity, being upright, thinking, noise and light and so on).Nowhere have I read such an excellent explanation of the issues that come up when you are forced through your illness to have to ask those around you to modify their behaviour in some way, how to survive one has to both accept the disease and also never stop actively looking for improvements and treatment - and many other issues.I applaud the author wholeheartedly for putting together such an amazing book, of such a high quality.Jodi Bassett, The Hummingbirds' Foundation for M.E. (HFME) and Health, Healing & Hummingbirds (HHH)
OHMSS is a great movie, period. Even though I think Sean Connery played 007 the best overall, I must say that George Lazenby was extremely convincing. It is difficult to imagine that he had no previous acting experience outside of TV commercials. OHMSS holds up well against any Bond movie in the franchise. The high points, in addition to Lazenby's excellent portrayal, is the music, (one of John Barry's best - R.I.P.) The Bond girl Diana Riggs, the Bond villian Telly Savalas, the incredible ski chase scenes (and amazing cinematography) and a human, vulnerable side of Bond being shown to the audience for the first time. All in all, it makes for a great motion picture experience. The movie has been criticized as a little long compared to other Bond flicks, but aren't most great movies a little long? For me, this movie held my interest throughout, so it did not seem long. It is a shame that George walked away from Bond after this one. Even so, OHMSS is so good, that this one movie is enough for many of us to agree that George Lazenby was one of the best James Bonds and that OHMSS was one of the best Bond films ever made.....
of course, my first vacuum was a $45 bagless and it lasted about a year and a half with okay performance. this thing, even tho it's not "self propelled," to me felt like it was pulling and helping me out. and the edge cleaner is impressive. yes, it does tip over when you use the attachments. i figured out that if you pull the attachment hose out and hold it, it doesnt tip the vacuum over.
Kathy Reichs is a solid writer and forensic anthropologist but this latest offering does not showcase any of her talents very well. Not very engaging, the characters and dialog lack dimension and the story line is less believable than it is sensational. In some respects it reminds me of an adult Nancy Drew.... Hopefully Kathy will return to her earlier style.
Unlike many autobiographies, this one avoided two frequent mistakes. First, it did not read like a boring recitation of events which plaques so much nonfiction. Barbara Holland is a gifted and interesting writer. But more importantly, she does not make excuses for, sugercoat, or gloss over her sometimes none too stellar behavior. She avoids the mistake of portraying herself as a heroine, always right, at the mercy of the mistakes of others. Her hobby of shop lifting as a young child is described and explained forthright, not excused. Even at the end of the book as life whirls out of control, she never whines. She always accepts responsibility for her behavior. Although she explains why she was misunderstood or why she was just plain acting badly, she never (like so many autobiograhers) blames anyone and everyone else for her troubles. This is an insightful look into the disturbed life of a sometimes happy, but mostly unhappy childhood, and a brilliant portrayal of the times. Growing up in the late fourties and fifties myself, this book jogged my memory over and over. It truly was a time like no other, an atmophere in American that our children and grandchildren, unfortunately, can never experience. Kids went out to play without supervision and had free rein of the neighborhood. We did not wear bike helmets and knee pads and globs of suntan lotion, and we certainly didn't carry music and cellphones. An innocent (and, as one reviewer says) a not so innocent time, when the world was neither more glorious nor less evil, but truly simpler, quieter, and incredibly, gloriously different.
This production is about as traditional as they come: a 1990s Bayreuth production, directed by Wolfgang Wagner, conducted by Giusppe Sinopoli. No acrobats, no flying pretzel monster, no nudity, no decaying rabbit. Boring, I should imagine...You might think that: I couldn't possibly agree. This production is excellent, and strongly recommended.The star of this production is not the director - it's the music of Wagner, ably interpreted by Sinopoli. I've watched Parsifal many times, in many forms. It tends to be ritualized, which is no bad thing, but Sinopoli brings a new freshness to the piece, and finds emotion within the ritual. The scene with Amfortas and his deceased father is delicately expressed. (Oddly enough, Schlingensief also focused on this scene, amidst the chaos of his production...)The quality of the singing is splendid, for the most part.Poul Elming's Parsifal was beautifully portrayed: incomparable heldentenor voice, plus a careful portrayal of Parsifal as the Tor, the simpleton: not stupid, merely incapable of dealing with the complexities and hypocrisies of life. In some portrayals, he seems to lose his innocence in the final act. Not in this production. He managed to combine authority with simplicity.It was fun to see Falk Struckman as Amfortas. We saw him in this role at the Met in 2003, chewing the woodwork and appealing to the gallery. The character of Amfortas deserves no less.Interesting to see Linda Watson as Kundry. She was fine, but the fey quality of the role seemed to have eluded her. Not unlike her current portrayal of Br&uuml;nnhilde.Hans Sotin's Gurnemanz was no more than adequate, but the rest of the cast compensated for this. I usually feel that the the performance of Parsifal stands or falls on Gurnemanz. This performance managed to stand on its own feet.Any anomalies? Kundry helped Parsifal to raise the Grail. Rather effective, and a subtle bit of regietheater.A worthy addition to any Wagnerite's library
"The Midwich Cuckoos," John Wyndham's 1957 science-fiction novel about an invasion of Earth by alien children, is generally superior to the movie version, "Village of the Damned." The story is set in the small English village of Midwich, where strange children are born to the local women, including virgins. The "cuckoos" in the title refers to some European species of cuckoo that lay their eggs in the nests of other birds which are fooled into hatching the eggs and caring for the young as their own. I have a high regard for most of Wyndam's writings, but this novel seemed to me to be missing the spark that energizes most of his work. The characterizations are good, as is the plot development, but the book should be much more scary than it is. Other writers have used the same theme of supernaturally evil children much more effectively. For example Ira Levin managed to sustain a feeling of dread and impending disaster throughout his best selling "Rosemary's Baby." Ray Bradbury, American contemporary of Wyndham, wrote two of his most chilling short stories, "The Veldt" and "Zero Hour," on the theme of evil lurking in the apparent innocence of children. I'm not sure why "The Midwich Cuckoos" fails to be an effective horror story, though I suspect that it's because Wyndham takes an overly intellectual approach to his subject. Criticisms aside, the book is short by today's standards and is light and enjoyable reading. I'm not sorry that I read it even though it fails to be all that it could have been.
One of the most influential hardcore bands ever and my personal favorite. Every aspect of this album is a work of art. From the slick, well illustrated booklet and packaging to the music itself. Scathing vocal fury reminiscent of an angry Rollins, meshed perfectly with a metallic, noise-damaged twin guitar attack and flailing drums. Each song is a concept, often flowing from drifting dissonance into a rising crescendo that climaxes with absolute chaos. Intelligent lyrics, tight musicianship, and the best band name I've heard yet. Buy it.
Remember stirrup pants? I used to wear my mom's all the time, back in the 80s. "No, you shouldn't wear women's clothing," my mom would say to me. But I would wear her pants anyhow.Well, I don't have to disobey her anymore! Look! Stirrup stockings! My prayers have been answered!Nowadays I walk around wearing my Lumiscope Stirrup Stockings and NOTHING ELSE. I stand out in a crowd now, let me tell you. Not only are these stockings great as my (only) piece of formalwear, I think I cut a dashing figure when wearing them on horseback.Lumiscope Stirrup Stockings: Kind of like shorts, but the other direction.
Richard Plant has done an amazing job with a most difficult subject. I deeply appreciated the necessity of providing a thorough background--a background that makes understanding the persecution of homosexuals in the Third Reich possible. To some this may seem a little dry, but I found it fascinating. His treatment of the homosexuals in the "camps" was thorough to the extent of his information. The only area he needed to cover in greater depth was the treatment of alleged homosexuals by the liberation armies. He only has a few sentences, and doesn't show as clearly as he should have that the Americans just moved many of those with pink triangles to other prisons.
Containing Coexistence studies what has to be one of the most interesting and least addressed questions related to the early years of the Cold War: how Finland managed to remain neutral and unoccupied. Jussi Hanhimaki has written a detailed, cogent account of the interactions of Finland, the United States and the Soviet Union, with particular emphasis to the changing American assessment of Finland's position in the Cold War.Probably the part of the book most relevant to students of the Cold War is the first section, which explains how Finland became the sole success story of Yalta. Soviet foreign policy toward Finland is assessed as having been primarily driven by security concerns.I personally wonder if Hanhimaki gives Finland's leadership too much credit for avoiding absorption into the Soviet bloc. It would seem that the weakness of Finland's communists, the Soviet choice not to advance into Finland in 1944, and the consolidation of Cold War tensions in Central Europe probably did more to shape Moscow's policy than did President Paasikivi's prudent policy. Clearly Helsinki played its cards very carefully and with real success, but I wonder to what extent the outcome was already determined by external events.In any case, this is an excellent book by a capable and eloquent scholar. It might have benefited from more evidence on the Soviet side, but this is understandly harder to secure.
I don't think Svevo is an artist that can be ruined or even significantly damaged by a translation, any more than Tolstoy can be messed up by Constance Garnett - it may not be as true to the quality of their prose, but for the most part I think their rare value is communicated as long as the translation is accurate: and this one is. The comparison to Tolstoy is apt, because I think Svevo is sort of a bridge between that tradition and Proust, where the writing starts drawing a great deal more attention to itself - and the internal workings of consciousness come to the forefront.Svevo strikes the perfect balance between the 19th century's skill at construction complete characters (well, at least the Russians and George Eliot) and the 20th century's desire to focus intensely on processes of thinking, to lay bare the way they function. What Joyce did by actually splitting up and writing Bloom's individual thoughts, Svevo accomplishes with sentences that have the precision and wit of a French aphorist, while retaining a level of compassion that can coexist with his irony.I remember a passage in The Confessions of Zeno (I read the Zoete translation on that one too) where, after a hilarious sequence when Zeno ends up marrying a woman that he has no interest in marrying, he comes to realize - many years later - just how much he's come to love her. Svevo is, I think, the most warm-hearted of great 20th century writers, even though all of his books are supposed to be merciless unmaskings of ineffectual men.As much as I loved The Confessions (or Conscience) of Zeno, this is the more complete work of art. The five linked stories in Zeno didn't really cohere (especially the last chapter), but this book is beautifully paced and constructed, the work of a young man who is already a master - funny and sad and wonderful. A book to treasure.(Incidentally: I like Joyce's title, As a Man Grows Older, but it would have been nice to have Svevo's original title back - which was only abandoned because they didn't think anyone would buy a book called Senility - certainly very few people bought Senilita when it was in Italian. And people were, understandably, confused, since there's no one in this book who is old, or any discussion in it of aging or senility.But the whole book is filled with an atmosphere of last things: it is also about virility, and the lack of it, and the desire to both have and get away from the mental clarity that comes with intelligence. Senility: a great writer knows how to come up with a great title. But this is still a lovely book in a beautiful edition: another wonderful reissue from NYRB.)
This game definitely brings more to the table than the typical &quot;get gold and raise army&quot; game. While that is the premise, the level of detail is an interesting break. And the micromanagement is made easier by peasants who, for example, can be taken from the farmwork they're doing to build something and when they're done they'll go back to farming. You can dictate where the peasants you &quot;create&quot; go to by default (like the rally point in Starcraft), including being able to default them into barracks for training or farms etc..The fact that you're tucked away in a castle means early rushes won't work unless it's 3-4 computers stomping you. Having to constantly supply your troops in the field with food is nice; it adds a layer of realism/complexity.The downside of the game is that it's repetative. Almost every level is the same, meaning that after the first 2 weeks, I only play it on average once a week. The fact that there are only 3 unit types (plus heroes) adds to the repetition. The battles have no real tactics and are won by upgrading the heck out of your troops, mounting them on horses and numbers.The battles and levels are fun, even is they are all pretty much the same. The graphics are great, the sound is good (except the annoying heroes, I hate their responses). Overall it's worthwhile if you like RTS with depth, but it's not on par with Starcraft (what is?).
THIS (Blieve it or not) is the Moody Blues' best, most consistent album. Every track is worth it, there R no big let-downs, &amp; the music is GORGEOUS! &quot;Blue World&quot;'s lyrics R practically a string of cliches, but it's great stuff! &quot;Meet Me Halfway&quot; is a great Hayward/Lodge collaboration. &quot;Sitting at the Wheel&quot; grows on you. In &quot;It's Cold Outside of Your Heart,&quot; Hayward Goes Country! -- Njoy the twanginess! &quot;Running Water&quot; is simply a gorgeous Hayward ballad; &quot;I Am&quot; is a Ray Thomas blast from the past; &amp; &quot;Sorry&quot; is 1 of Thomas's best songs in YEARS! The remaining 2 tracks R at the very least solid filler -- great Patrick Moraz keyboard sound effects on &quot;Hole in the World,&quot; 2 (even if it is just a prelude 4 &quot;Under My Feet&quot;). Great production from Pip Williams (who also helmed LONG DISTANCE VOYAGER), &amp; all the guys R in Xcellent voice! Don't know why this album took such a beating from fans &amp; critics, &amp; the sales figures were some of the guys' worst ever. But it's brilliant! A magnificent way 2 bring down the curtain on a long, honorable career. 2 bad the Moodies have only pulled off about 4 good songs since this album came out....
_Yellow Fever, Black Goddess: The Coevolution of People and Plagues_ could have been a penetrating examination of the relationship between humanity and disease. Christopher Willis certainly had fertile ground to work, but the book ends up being a dull and pedantic trudge that fails to bring the best of the academic or the popular to the reader.The text wanders through evolutionary biology and human history without any real sense of direction. The biographies and personal histories read like indifferent `human interest' stories injected into an otherwise uninteresting science news broadcast.
My husband bought this for me on our first wedding anniversary almost 3 years ago and I never used it until yesterday (Christmas Day). I just displayed it because it was so pretty and special. I decided to try it out and absolutely loved the way it cooked and felt. I can't beleive I've had it for this long without using it. I'm ASHAMED! Lol! I know my husband was happy to see that I used it. I will use it all the time now...I just wanted to recommend it to anyone thinking about getting it. It's beautiful and functional as well=)
I had to stop reading because I could not tolerate this novel any longer! I read 280 pages, and just couldn't finish it. Explicit sexual scenes seem to be the norm with Baxter these days. In this pornographic novel, Baxter describes two naked teenage children having sex in public, with adults watching them while pleasuring themselves. He goes into graphic detail. It's disgusting and shameful. Oh...it's all part of the story, and their behavior is just a result of the key plot element.That's an excuse to explore deviant behavior.I am shocked that Clarke associated with this rubbish, because it reads nothing like a Clarke novel. For whatever reason, Baxter's publisher managed to get Clarke's name on the book. In my estimation, Clarke wrote or co-wrote the first chapter and that's all, because that was the only good part of the book! (BAIT AND SWITCH!).I have completely turned 180 degrees from being a fan of Baxtor to absolutely loathing his garbage now. He had a good run early on, but has totally lost it. I loved Ring, The Time Ships, Flux, all the way up to Vacuum Diagrams. This novel, like all of his recent work, suffers from pathetically weak character development (I am so apathetic toward his characters, I can't recall their names). His use of questionable and outdated physics theories, and his obsession with explicit sexual scenes makes this all but intolerable to a true sci-fi fan. I will never read anything from this former author again.
Simply a brilliant album from beginning to end. Even though I believe Mindcrime was a better album(specifically how it was conceptually story based) Empire is a neck and neck with my favorites. From hard rockin songs like Empire and Best I can to Silent Lucidity and Another Rainy Night this album expands all levels of rock! Geoff Tate's vocal range is off the charts, and perhaps the best vocalist in rock history. His voice with the guitars and arrangement of DeGarmo make this album one of the best ever.
I got this blush on a special sale and was thrilled with the great deal, since CG had been advertising this product pretty heavily in my area. I picked up "shimmering sands" because the packaging looked close to the color of my previous blusher.As soon as I opened it, a huge cloud of blush came flying through the air. It was almost impossible not to breathe it in. I figured I had opened it too fast, but when I went to load the little "pouf" with powder, even more blush went into the air. In fact, I couldn't even use the pouf because it just threw blush in all directions. I had to apply with my usual blush-brush. Even so, I have to tap a small amount into the lid of the container and then just barely dip my brush, and even so the powder is difficult to control.Unfortunately, another drawback is that this blush is at least 2 shades lighter than my skin tone. I'm pretty light, and when I put this stuff on it looks like I've applied my foundation unevenly on my cheeks because "shimmering sands" is more like "white sands of Florida." I can barely see it, and it certainly doesn't give me any sort of blush.Highly disappointing product. Not recommended.
I have quite a few Rodney Yee DVDs, but this one may be my favorite. He holds the poses much longer than on other tapes, which I especially like. I have a newer version of this DVD and the cover looks different than the one pictures here on Amazon.The main routine on the DVD is approx. 45 minutes in length and includes stretches performed with a chair, traditional standing poses, floor poses, and final relaxation. On the newer DVD version that I have this workout is broken into two sections: stretching and strength so you can do each individually if you like.You also get a set of mini-workouts that are terrific. They are NOT excerpts from the long routine, but rather individually taped short routines approx. 10 minutes each. They target specific sports (Tennis, Running, Golf, Cycling, Swimming, and All Other Sports), but I like to do them in sequence with a lovely rest between each one for a total routine of approx. 45 min.You do not need to be an athlete to enjoy these routines and I highly recommend this one for just about every level of yogi and yogini :o)Check my other yoga and meditation DVD reviews on Amazon.
I had worried that by book three the brilliant Dave Putnam would have run out of steam in his Gamekeeper Series. I needn't have feared as 10 Downing Street continues with the English Commonwealth controlling most of the Earth and a communist conspiracy existing which builds toward a massive World War II. It is more than just capitalism against communism and Putnam reveals he can just as handily explore different economic systems as he has done so beautifully in dealing with politics, war, working with animals, and especially religion. The alternate world series continues with the addition of new characters and making excellent use of old ones from the first two books. Winston Churchill again reigns supreme, at least for a while as this book covers a great number of years. More time is spent with the most interesting Albert Einstein. You find Dwight D. Eisenhower, Rommel, and George Patton as well. Historical figures are dealt with in a way that will convince the reader that the author knows his history. The fictional ones are as real and alive as any you'll find in the very best of novels. He also doesn't make the mistake of bringing in characters that could not have been born after history took a major twist in the 1890's. The work is brilliant, there are twists and surprises and even the sometimes too long technical descriptions are interesting. The author also knows how to tell decent love stories and to treat women as human beings. Toward the end there is a touch of Asimov and Clement, however I don't want to be a spoiler. What I like best is that unlike Turtledove and some other science fiction authors, Putnam isn't afraid to make religion and the fact that God exists as a vital part of his universe as it is in our real universe. As a Christian I did not agree with all the views expressed, but I was not offended as the three books have the feel of being written with love. The best news is that a 4th book follows and I will order it just as soon as I post this review. Dave Putnam's novels deserve to be considered classics.
If you're any kind of fan of Weird Al's work, this CD is definitely worth having, though not his best-ever effort. I'd place it slightly above midway on my list of Weird Al albums, as far as quality.There are a couple of real gems on this album. My favorite would have to be "Why Does This Always Happen To Me?" which has the rare honor among Weird Al's oevre (yes, he's got one of those, honest!) of actually having a serious message, albeit presented in a typically demented style. It focuses on someone who's upset at the minor inconveniences he suffers as a result of the tragedies in other people's lives, and in my view it does a better job of encouraging you to keep your life in perspective than any of the more serious takes on the topic I've ever heard. I believe the tune was original, though it had a familiar ring to it.I also really appreciated "hardware store", mostly for the minute-long segment where he lists a few dozen products to be found in the store without taking a single breath. Gotta appreciate the skills, plus, it was funny (as if I need to mention that fact)."Ode to a Superhero" is the story of the movie Spider-Man set to the tune of "Piano Man". It holds up well next to his earlier similar efforts ("Yoda", "The Saga Begins"), though it's not quite up to the same level.The parodies were all pretty solid, though only "Couch Potato" (from Eminem's "Lose Yourself"), and "A Complicated Song" (from Avril Levigne's "Complicated") seem likely to have any real staying power. "Trash Day" (from Nelly's "Hot in Here"), and "Ebay" (from the Back Street Boys' "I Want it That Way") were decent enough, but not something I'm likely to seek out in a year or two."Party at the Leper Colony" (a collection of puns about body parts falling off with a tune vaguely reminiscent of "Footloose") was good for a quick giggle, and that's about it. Ditto for "Bob" (an interesting collection of palindromes, but you'd get more from just reading the lyrics, I think) and "Wanna B Ur Lovr" (a collection of pickup lines, some of which are pretty funny, I'll admit).The polka medley was about the weakest one Weird Al has ever done. It had one or two moments, but generally didn't have the edge it needed.By far the worst track on the CD, though, is "Genius in France". It just went on and on, and not in a good way, like "Albuquerque", either. It was as if Al had extra space on the CD and just decided to keep saying "Genius in France" repeatedly to fill out the time. I listened all the way through the first time, just in case it got better at some point, but it was just mindless and long, so now I just turn off the CD when I get to it.
An extremely enjoyable and entertaining book. I loved Aiden, a real heck of a guy, and Olivia, although sometimes she tried too hard to hide her lights under the bushel. Suspenseful and interesting characters throughout. I will go for &quot;Key West&quot; next and any other book by Stella Cameron I can find.
I found this movie entertaining. The acting and dialogue was grade &#34;B&#34; but Tatum pulled it together with his phenomal talent. Those moves are tough to duplicate. LOL
Nothing fancy about these, but they are simple enough to go with just about any other glassware you have. I needed to purchase 24 for a big party and found them very nice looking (no bubbles in the glass or unevenness in stems), and they were so much better than the alternative of using disposable flutes.I also like that they are sturdy enough to wash in the top rack of the dishwasher.
this is designed primarily for indoor use and works very well on carpet or other household flooring. It is less satisfactory on cement. If you are planning walks in the neighborhood, look for something with wheels better able to cushion the blows. This was easy to assemble and adjust and a good value for the price.
The book had a good premise, but the writer was unable to execute it effectively. Good hero, good heroine, good story line, good location all equal just an o.k. book. I was very disappointed.
I loved the care this book took not to become too dryly academic, but at the same time to provide good, useful information. Interesting topics and figures in early English history such as Eric Bloodaxe, Stonehenge and Sutton Hoo are introduced in an engaging way, with many intersting illustrations and maps. This is the perfect book for someone looking to find out more about this subject, but not wanting to be put to sleep.We can only hope that the television series upon which it is based will someday become available for purchase as well.
I thought this book will be funny and maybe helpful.I'm 6 months pregnant right now and happy I didn't read this junk before pregnancy-I would be scared and disgusted. I love being pregnant, I feel sexy, special, and love my body. I take care of myself and didn't gain a lot of weight, still working out at the gym, don't have moods and don't avoid my husband;) I know everybody is different but it can't be that bad like in this book.The author made pregnancy looking sooo bad I couldn't believe it. For example I had to google what is Muumuu-I checked that out and wow! How can you wear it ever? This will make you look bigger and totally miserable, I think the key to look good always is to wear your size clothes, no matter how small/big you are. But the author insists to get it and don't care what other will say-well no wonder she had sex with her husband ONCE during 9 months (don't blame it on wearing parachute; clearly this marriage wasn't cool already).The most surprising is the quality of jokes here. I was looking for something more witty and sophisticated, the jokes are really low, kind of like stupid movies when someone farts for a minute and that suppose to be funny. I smiled once or maximum twice through the whole book. Sometimes I like stupidity too, but when I found it on every page I felt embarrassed.The book is very short-one evening with some breaks of reading and that's it, it's more of a pamphlet than book. After I've read reviews of other popular books I decided not to get any of them, as most of the authors are bitter and books are outdated. I'm sticking with book from my doctor, regular informative book that doesn't give me headaches:)So if you have similar pregnancy to Jenny M. or you like this kind of humor than get it and maybe enjoy it, but personally I wouldn't recommend it or give it as a gift.The last note is a little word to mums-to-be: do yourself a favor and don't listen to all those pregnancy/delivery stories about bad things that happened to your friends, their friends etc. Enjoy your pregnancy and stay positive. You can not control the future and worries about tomorrow will ruin your mood now. I've heard stupid rumors or maybe truth about one doctor and hoped I won't have to deliver with her. And than she comes in and I said to myself whatever, I gotta give a birth and I don't care if she has an attitude or prefers C section. Stayed cool and happy, I did the best I could and had an awesome delivery with some laughs (obviously with epidural otherwise i wouldn't laugh too much). On top of that the doctor's name who made my son's circumcision was...Wang.Listen to those stories.
My father passed away a few months ago and the library had this DVD. I got it for my son who is 8 years old, but I also ended up feeling comforted by the healing words the author speaks. That being said, I found this to be informative yet gentle for a child's mind and not terribly fantasy-like. There is one part where the person who passed away comes down and flies away with the survivor child -- that's about as "untrue" as it gets.Overall I would definitely recommend this for any age..
First time I listened this CD I used it to give a relaxation massage. Never before I went into a so special atmosfere. My patient turned completely relaxed and she almost felt asleep. I think it is the best music to relaxation massage and for couples it also gives an erotic environment.
I am the proud owner of Sam Cooke's The Man and His Music. And yet I am more thrilled to also own and thus faithfully listen to and enjoy Portrait of a Legend. The sound quality of Portrait of a Legend is significantly and very noticeably better than the sound quality of The Man and His Music. You will better hear Sam Cooke's beautiful and thrilling voice than you have ever heard it in your lifetime! Because Sam Cooke along with Elvis Presley are the very best vocalists of my lifetime, because, more than anything else in music, I enjoy outstanding vocals, and because Portrait of a Legend has superior sound quality, Portait of a Legend is one of the most treasured and most enjoyed cds that I own. If you love Sam Cooke's voice and phrasing, as I do, or if you are considering buying only one Sam Cooke cd, you will truly love Portrait of Legend! This cd epitomizes a MUST BUY CD.John
At first, I was surprised no one had posted a review of this product yet, but then I realized that the government must be putting pressure on Amazon to remove any reviews. I can only hope that at least some of you get to read this review before the truth is suppressed!For years, I've been constructing my Aluminum Foil Deflector Beanies (AFDBs) out of conventional aluminum foil, but the thin gauge of most products causes it to deform too much and develop small holes which allow high-frequency electromagnetic radiation through. Now, I always thought small holes wouldn't be a problem because most government mind control and surveillance devices typically use low frequency radiation which can't get through.Still, I decided to try this product because I thought the thicker foil might at least provide a more aesthetically pleasing effect when I wear it. It definitely did that, but I was also shocked to discover that when I wore a beanie constructed of this 20 micron foil, I suddenly stopped having the urge to go out and vote Republican. It was like night and day!I'm in the process of taking a bunch of personality tests with and without my new AFDB, and so far the results are shocking.This foil is waaay more effective than anything I've tried before. The differences are now strong enough that I may be able to triangulate the source of the signals.Buy some now, before the government puts these people out of business!And good luck finding me! You can go after the poor schmuck whose account I'm using, but you'll never find me because I went through 7 proxies!
I started my gaming career four years ago with Half-Life and its &quot;mods.&quot; With this recent game from LucasArts, I was amazed at its graphics and levels and shocked that the same company that produced "X-Wing" could make something similar to Unreal, Half-Life, or other shooter games. I only wish that this game would be more stable on my Win OS; I had to restart the game a couple of times before continuing. And I also hope that LucasArts would stick more towards PC's rather than producing it's Star Wars games for gaming consoles.
First off,let me just say that I bought this game EXPECTING it to be dissapointing with all the negative reviews that the"professional" game critics(and some ameatuer ones) gave it.I canhonestly say that Blood Omen 2 is an excellent game,and all the "horrific" frame rate problems and load times that people have been squawking about,have been extremely exagerated!The only real problem with frame rate speed I encountered were whenever I would first enter into a room every now and then;and even THAT wasn't very often!Also,it should be noted that these frame rate "problems" NEVER occured during any of the actual fight/combat action sequences.That is something that I think all players would be relieved to know,as fighting is the most crucialelement of Blood Omen 2!Now for writing the things that this game DOES do(all of which are great!)If you are intrested in this game,then 9 out of 10,youalready know the very complex and addicting storyline....so I'll skip the whole history lesson!In a nutshell,you awake some 200 years after the events in Blood Omen 1,but about 1000 years before Soul Reaver 1 and 2.The Sarafan(religous zealots sworn to wipe out vampires)have taken a fascist-like control over the landof Nosgoth.Kain's former vampire lieutinants have also betrayed him by joining forces with the Sarafan.Naturally,Kain is enragedand wants revenge(have we ever known Kain for anything else??) Thus enters Umah:the very feminine,very sensuous,very partially dressed vampire(yeah,I LIKE Umah!)As for Umah,and Kain and all of the other characters,they are excellent;visualy.The graphics of Blood Omen 2 is great eye candy;not so much in the fantasy sense of Soul Reaver 2,but in more of a macabre,industrial sense.But that only helps to emphasize the nature and storyline of the game.Both the storyline and voice-acting are first class(would you come to expect anything less from this series?)The gameplay is very easy to get the hang of and so much fun!-pick up a guy by the throat!lop off a guy's head from behind!-Very sadistic yes, but very addicting!As for all the whining over quoate/unqoate"way too easy block and switch puzzels",hey,they're more than welcome in my book!I'd rather dive straight into the action and learn more of the great story than burst my brain trying to solve some puzzle!Just on a quick note,I thought there were WAY too many puzzles in both Soul Reaver 1 and 2!And let's face it, most of us only solved those puzzles by looking in a strategy guide cause we couldn't figure them out ourselves!So bring on the easy puzzles say I!All and all,this is a great game that you should definatly buy esp. if you are a fan of the series!As for the one reviewer who wrote that "it doesn't play as smoothly as the XBOX version",I hope he realizes that you can only play Blood Omen 1 and Soul Reaver 1 and 2 on Playstation.After all,Sony started this great epic legacy......NOT Bill Gates!!
If you like to almost voyeuristically enjoy self-involved parents' emotional ups and downs hanging on their toddlers' placement in preschool, this documentary is for you. Of course all the stories are human and touching, but at almost every turn the viewer is jolted into a more realistic perspective as the parents lose theirs (you could argue they never had any to begin with). One almost feels a bit sorry for these parents who single-mindedly believe or want to believe in the "feeder school" system and that preschool is the beginning of a chain reaction that leads to proper university and success in life. If life were only that formulaic...
Hello World,Misguiding title and cover. Thought it would be like Rolling Kansas or Road Trip, not at all. His parents grow weed, so what! I could barely make it through the entire movie.
I wasn't disappoined with this movie since I wasn't expecting too much. However, it should be said that the "Saga of the Volsungs" and "the Nibelungenlied" are my two favorite books.What I like about the "Nibelungenlied" is the giant battle at the end when Siegfried's widow gathers an army of vengeance to avenge her lover."Volsungs," though, explains the character of Kriemhilde much better than "Nibelungenlied."In either case, you have to read both books to appreciate the story of Siegfried/Brunhilde.Anyways, there are parts in this movie where it deviates from both books - and in my opinion, it did a FAIRLY good job with it (considering it was made for television).There are very weak aspects of the movie though:1) The BIGGEST weakness of this movie was the casting of Siegfried. Whether you know him as Sigurd of Siegfried, the initial hero of the story is supposed to be a massive, courageous and "manly" hero - the actor they casted for this movie has a tiny stature and smiles way too much to be a tough guy. And the script (whether improvised or not) turns Siegfried/Sigurd into a wise-cracking comedian. This completely mutilates any pre-conceived notions you've had of Siegfried/Sigurd.2) This movie only deals with the "Nibelungenlied" up until the point where he dies. The old German silent film, "Die Nibelungen," actually divides the movie into two parts: "Siegfried" and "Kriemhilde's Revenge."3) In truth, this movie feels more like the "Saga of the Volsungs" than the "Nibelungenlied." Because of that, we don't awesome introduction of Siegfried commanding his way into the domain of the Burgundians. We also don't get the awesome battle at the end where Hagen, Gunther and everyone pretty much dies in a giant battle.Anyways, if you're a fan of Volsungs/Nibelungenlied, you should definitely check this movie out (if you've already seen the German silent films based on the same subject-matter). The actress who plays Kriemhilde does an awesome job - exactly the way I envisioned her.
Just received this scale for my birthday - it is perfect! Easy to operate, comes with batteries - and it IS accurate! I compared it to my Weight Watcher's weigh-in number, and it was right on the money. Lightweight, nice size, perfect all around. We're very happy with all the features, and highly recommend this digital scale to anyone looking for one!
I am a first time Maca user, so I can only comment on the short term. I use saw palmetto, l.arginine, l.carnitine and I also STOP using them after awhile to see what it's it's like without them. I can say for sure that saw palmetto in small doses (you don't want to overuse it) absolutely increased the quality and volume of my semen, pretty important for a 60 year old man in good health with a good looking wife. Too much, and you can upset your stomach and your hormone balance. L.arginine every other day and the same with l.carnitine has had a pronounced effect on my energy levels and erectile quality. Too much and it makes me irritable and aggressive. I wanted to try Maca after much research, but didn't want to have a large quantity in case it didn't agree with me. There are various colors of Maca and flavors for each color. The black Maca is supposed to be the best, but I bought this Gold for just over $5, it's gone up a few dollars already. It has an earthy taste that is not disagreeable in a fruit smoothie. I took my first scoop on a Friday at work and I was tired from the long hours I had already put in the previous days. I had no stomach issues and I felt very calm, yet energized at the same time. This took about an hour, then later I experienced a *tingly* feeling in my genitals that I have not had since I was young or just taken viagra. I don't see any black root at Amazon right now, but for now I'm sticking with the Gold. After a few jars, I'll stop using it and see what that feels like. I don't take just any supplement that is popular. I tried glucosamine/chondrotin, for instance and NEVER got any arthritis or joint pain relief even after taking three large bottles over the span of a year or so. It just didn't work for me. I have a good feeling about this product so far. Not a tasty powder, but not bad at all in a sweet fruit smoothie.I can't emphasize the effect on the quality and quantity of my erections enough! I have spectacular nocturnal erections for a man my age. My digestion is regular and comfortable. I could stop ED meds all together and now only take them for entertainment purposes. The taste IS earthy, but it could be downright bitter (it's not) and I'd STILL love this product.
I needed information about the McCarthy hearings and everything that surrounded them. I got it here. I also got a whole lot of other things. I still find it frustrating when the FBI still clasifies some pages, but this disk has helped me research the subject fully.
Snuff films have been the topic of many horror novels and movies (cf. LAST HOUSE ON DEAD END STREET, HARDCORE, EMMANUELLE IN AMERICA, 52 PICK UP, 8MM, amongst many others).Insofar, SURVIVOR is not exactly groundbreaking inventive plotwise. However, this novel far exceeds similar efforts in its disturbing gruesomeness. It is also far more effective in making the reader believe that snuff films do exist in reality.The story concerns a lawyer couple, Brad and Lisa MILLER, on a trip to a brief vacation. They are stalked on their way by a red van. The van driver gets Brad arrested by cops on set up reckless driving charges and later that day, abducts Lisa from her motel room and whisks her away to a remote cabin in the woods. It turns out that she has been kidnapped for a snuff film ring, and the prospect of being raped, brutally tortured and killed on camera forces Lisa to resort to extreme measures to survive...I will not go into much more detail plotwise, but let me assure you that SURVIVOR is without a doubt one of the most disturbing and violent novels you will ever read. I know this sounds like a promotional tagline, but it is true. While the actual torture and killings are for the most part not descriped in a detailed way, the aftermath is detailed sickeningly graphic. And it is not just the gore, the torture and the murders (while there is no shortage of that), it is the convincing portrayal of the villains, the way these sleazy scumbags behave and talk, even if they don't murder women (and an infant!) for money and their sadistic sexual pleasure (and that of their clients). There is the appropriately nicknamed "Animal", nice looking corporate executive type All-American guy, who enjoys doning his bondage mask and sadistically torturing and killing on camera in his spare time. Then there is Lisa's kidnapper Tim MURRAY, who does not give a damn about anything as long as he gets his cash. Al, the snuff film ring's cameraman, who thankfully gets a nasty comeuppance. (And to think what Animal did with his neck post mortem almost makes me gag even now.)Rick SHECTMAN, the sleazebag porn producer. And an unlikely but believeable serial killer appears...These guys are not in an entertaining way sick, they are disturbingly sick.Truth be told I could have done without the nauseating animal cruelty (Tim MURRAY, Lisa's kidnapper, has a flashback of a childhood trauma, where his vicious father killed little Tim's pet rabbit). Yeah, I know it is fictious, and it is also not gratitious, as this remembrance triggers a character development, but anyway...It should be clear that SURVIVOR is not for everybody. In a way I'm at a loss on how to rate this novel. As an attempt at total gross out horror it succeeds. It is very well written, with convincing characters and great dialogue. Only once or twice does the dialogue get a bit cheesy ("I haven't had boiled eyeballs in a while";p.220) But be aware that my five star rating does not only indicate an outstanding horror read; it also represents five stars on the throw-up-o-meter.Casual horror fans, who enjoy their Stephen KING or who think the FRIDAY THE 13TH-movies (nothing wrong with that) are the ultimate in movie violence should avoid SURVIVOR. Such a reader very likely will not make it much further than the prologue - trust me on that!
Having gone thru all the Patrick O'Brien, C.S. Forester & Richard Woodman novels in the age of sailing ships, I tried this & was profoundly disappointed! This should be first & foremost labeled "fantasy, pre-teen". Even if one could swallow the "time warp" premise, the resulting actions leave out any concept of the reality that might have been dove into in blending the two totally disparate times. But, even that wasn't as ridiculous as the ending... I admit that I like happy endings, but this was so far beyond the realm of reality as to be a parody. I suggest the author do a great deal of research into the real lives & times of the British seamen & the idioms used in those times... if indeed, he wishes us to view his work with more than dismay...
Terrible disappointment from previous Hannibal films. The plot and acting dosen't measure up to Anthony Hopkins performances, This flick not worth buying or watching
I had to stop on page 290. I can't take it anymore. This book is difficult to get through--maybe the author will be eaten by this cliched, predictable, and ANNOYING storyline in the end. I can see the newspaper headline now: "Steve Alten devoured by his own mind-numbing creation. The world celebrates the author's disappearance into the maw of his own obnoxious creation." Wonderful!Where do I start? Where does anyone typically start? Look at the storyline. It has potential in the beginning, but like other reviewers, I find it gets boring and predictable. The nearly indestructible Megalodon breaks out of its steel cage and eats, eats, and eats people, boats, and a few sea creatures [hey, who would think a shark--what Alten likes to call a "giant great white" (name it for what it actually is, Stevie boy)--would eat SEALS, WHALES, and SEA LIONS rather than blubber-free humans?]. THis has been seen before in Jaws but at a larger sacle. As another reviewer has stated, bigger does not mean better. In this case, "bigger" stands for "loss of belief in Alten's writing style and plot direction." Some plotlines are interesting, such as the use of the underwater facilities with the evil Benedict Singer, but what truly ruins them is Alten's horrid use of characters in the underwater and above-water scenes. Alten--a name I shall forever remember for writing a terrible book called The Trench...The major problem is Alten's ineptitude toward character development: all of his creations are stupid, unbeilevable peons in Alten's silly rendition of suspense. In the beginning, all of their eyes seem to "flash with anger" or "fury," which just is perturbing when repeated so many times. Annoying as hell is Jonas Taylor, who is obsessed with a recurring nightmare that he is in a specific submersible, watching his wife being eaten by a Megalodon. This nightmare not only haunts this sissified version of a lead character but also the reader: Alten won't let us get past Jonas' desire to piss all over the story and make us feel sorry for him. GET OVER IT! It's so damn irritating to have to read about this nightmare junkie's obsession with the friggin' shark. There is Terry Taylor (couldn't he have chosen a better last name so that this once powerful female figure could remind me of someone OTHER THAN a professional wrestler?), a woman who, in Alten's first book in the series, is a powerful figure (for a while). Now, she has no motivation to do anything beyond her role as Jonas' wife. Other men take advantage of her, and she keeps saying, "Damn! Why did I let him take advantage over me?" She is powerless when confronting Benedict and other men, which makes her a far weaker character than she could have been. Pathetic! What about the cold-hearted, malicious Dr. Maren? Wow--an evil scientist...THAT took me by surprise. I don't believe these or other characters at all. I want them all dead. Eat them, Angel! Munch like you have never munched before!What really wreaks is the combination of characters in the story. Even though, when by themselves, the characters are not believable, they are even weaker when joined together in desperate situations. Celeste, the evil corporate woman, constantly tries to seduce Jonas; he pushes her away; he brags about being felt up to Mac, his pilot friend--does this make any sense? Is this supposed to get us interested in the story? How about the idiocy of ALL the characters when trying to catch the Megalodon? Somehow, the shark outsmarts them every time. With all the technology and firepower available to capture this "giant great white," Alten does a marvelous job of screwing up another story by giving the Megalodon far too much credit. I think that the existence of this shark today would be a blessing: it could run for presidential office, escape the grasp of citizens, reporters, and Congress, and eat them all the while, one by one.Jonas and Mac say they are angry and venomous toward the Megalodon enough times to make one think they are telling the truth, but they do not do anything to stop its advance because the shark is too smart. Alten makes them yell out with pure hatred for the shark (which seems to do a good job of pushing their buttons--maybe the shark is like a velociraptor in that "it's thinking") but does nothing with these characters when the shark get away. He takes us on a silly, little chase that serves to distance the reader from the text rather than engage it. I find myself wondering why I continue reading when, in fact, the reason is that I have been fascinated with the Megalodon for some time. However, unlike Alten, I would not make the shark superior to modern technology, nor would I give the Megalodon Columbo-like skills.And what about the star character, Angel--the megalodon? What is there to criticize? I couldn't possibly say that the shark is the smartest character in the book--oh, wait, it IS! It outsmarts every scientist and specialist EVERY FREAKING TIME! It must be a genius shark. No WONDER it was nearly driven to extinction, you think--it was smart enough to see past the junk that Alten created for you. On top of that, the shark is unbeatable. No, no, don't fight it: the shark wins every time, hands down. I don't care if it is tracked using the latest technology or targeted with advanced military hardware--it cannot die. This is the Highlander of sharks. See, its size gives it super-duper powers of convenience: it "happens" to detect the slightest vibrations of a kayak but ignores the v-v-vibrations of a submersible craft; it is sooooooo aggressive that its violent behavior becomes this "accepted thing" that just has to be a part of what makes a Megalodon a Megalodon; it attacks boats without prior testing them to see if they are edible--it eats them, wood, plastic, or steel; and it has the ability to break through a wooden dock, section by section, because it (again) is able to "hear" the people running from it.Alten knows that a real Megalodon would not--in all liklihood--act like this. If his comparisons to great white sharks hold any truth, it is that they would have similar characteristics. Would a real Megalodon be so ravenous as to have an appetite like that of J. R. R. Tolkien's Shelob? Obviously not. This book serves to create fear and misconceptions about sharks, particularly one that probably does not exist anymore. That is pretty lame.Inspiring frustration rather than genuine suspense, Alten takes us through the monotonous maw (man, it is SO irritating to see that word repeated over and over and over) of a cliched fear of anything that bites in the ocean and makes it much, much worse because he is unable to keep readerly interest. The cover text, "Terror has never run this deep," should read, "Terror has never been this depressing." May a REAL animal strike Alten's maw with its paw for ever creating this faux pas. Use that line in your next book, Alten!

I will start by saying that my interest in this subject is life long and limitless. I am an amature scientist and a professional artist who's career has been sculpting prehistoric life for over thirty years now. So I was presold. Yes. I loved what I saw.But everyone may not be as happy with it as I am.We all want to see living dinosaurs as often and easily as we do African Lions and Coral Reefs. The international success of the Walking With Dinosaurs series proved that this fasination is not confined to children and paleo-geeks like me. And the flood of new CGI dinosaur material looks better than ever, for the most part. Sadly, by the second episode I found the series wanting.This particular vidio is very well written. And the imagery is striking. But, after the first episode it is obvious that each script is designed to use the same footage, and the same animals, to tell a number of differant stories. Granted,I see everything that comes out and own most of them. I have been building my library since the early eighties. So I am a tough critic.For me,the visuals were remarkable,the first time. But when most of the footage from one episode to the next is the same view of the same three or four animals doing the same moves to differant narraration, one feels a bit short changed. The information is good for older viewers. I suspect children might get the episodes confused or think them repititious. And in that respect they are.For teachers, the key might be to watch each episode seperately, on different days.This kind of padding is a dissapointment and an insult to collectors, like me. The content could have held up for two episodes. But not three or for.IMHO
I've a dog who loves to pull the fuzz off of tennis balls. So I decided to get him a Kong ball to chomp on... only he didn't want to chew on it. He didn't even pay any attention to it for the first month. I tried putting peanut butter on it to entice him but he would lick it and then move on. A month later I decided to toss the ball around in the backyard by myself and all of a sudden he wanted it. Granted he still only plays with it when I want to throw it around in the backyard but whatever.

Review by Tyler Wagnon:The main problem that has kept On Broken Wings in the second or third tier of metalcore acts is their inconsistent songwriting. It's All a Long Goodbye does a better job at keeping things cohesive, but it still has its flaws.Yes, we know you guys like to play a breakdown, and then play it again slower. On occasion, it can be a very cool and effective touch when a band does that, especially if the breakdown is a real whopper. It doesn't need to be on EVERY breakdown though. Seriously.Vocally, they are far from perfect. The clean singing is terrible and unnecessary... flat out. Please never try it again. Please. Also, the death growls are extremely breathy and weak. If you can't do the vocals with any force, don't do them at all.Overall, the music is pretty decent though. Most of the breakdowns are pretty befitting, the rhythms are pretty much on part, but nothing spectacular. Their metal riffs could be beefed up a bit because they tend to go into European territory too much which sinks them even further into the background of today's musical landscape.I was really hoping they would have made more strides in the right direction on this one, but oh well, perhaps they are doomed to mediocrity. It's sad when that happens to a band, but it happens quite a bit.
This book was truly incredible as well as inspirational. I'm very picky about the novels I read, and this blew my socks off! I highly recommend reading this book. You'll fall in love with it!!
I ordered a whole bunch of metal tubing/piping from this company, and appreciated the quality of the pipes, the excellent packaging (in individual plastic tubes rubber banded together to minimize shifting, then all inside cardbopard tubes well sealed). Very impressed.
These have lasted for 100s hours so far and sound good. There pretty comfortable but they could be more comfortable across the top but around the ears their almost perfect.. The cord is extra long so if you use them around the house their great. They also look good for big phones..
This cd case is an excellent companion in the car, and it is the best i have found that holds 92 cd's. Although it is a little bulky, it can always be set in the backseat or in a closet. If you have a large cd collection, case logic is definitly your best bet.
Ah...how can someone NOT like this book? It's just so ..well..60's. Chocked full of all that we secretley love peeking into, the life of movie stars,drug dependency,sex and struggling to make it in a mean world and a mean business. Our three main characters Neely,Jennifer and Ann are all self destructive drama queens in their own distinctive way. It offers a panorama view of how shallow life can be if you put your priorities in the wrong things and the grief chasing after these can bring. It really is classic commentary .
As a motorcyclist and adventure tourer, I found this book fascinating and well written. Definitely one of the best books of the genres, a fascinating blend of travel, adventure, political history, geography. The author is engaging and witty, open, and spellbinding.
In the 1960s when I was growing up, Dr. Holzer was a minor celebrity who often showed up on shows like 'The Merve Griffin Show" and similar talk shows. He also wrote what seemed like hundreds of books concerning experiences he'd had with people and their "haunted" houses. He was a major role in my interest in the paranormal, which I still have. Holzer wasn't perfect-he was a name dropper, he could be washpish about his disagreements with people (I remember he was mad at the VanTrapp family from "The Sound of Music, who ran a hotel of some sort He said they ran a "Van Tourist Trapp.") I bought the giant print version of this book-I may have to get the kindle version and sell the old one. The print version weighs about 15lbs and is enormous. I have a great affection for Dr. Holzer and hope he's happy wherever he is now. This is a good book to have. Some stories are very good and some are mediocre. I recommend this book.
This CD (and its sequel, volume 2) is a good sampling of jazz during its first decade. Included are representative tracks from the greats of the 1920s, including Louis Armstrong, Red Nichols, Bix Biederbecke &amp; Duke Ellington, plus early tracks from Benny Goodman, Glenn Miller and the Dorsey brothers.Not all of the tracks here are great. Some of the early tracks are quite without swing, and occasionally the inadequacy of the original studio leaves the music sounding desperately thin. However, with 50 numbers to choose from, there are still a number of good tracks (my own favourite is &quot;Paducah&quot; by the Chocolate Dandies).The recordings have some crackle and hiss from the source disks, which is usually preferable to having the sound &quot;cleaned&quot; to the point where half the musical frequencies disappear. I find the &quot;noise&quot; of these early recordings to be very evocative of the period. (If the noise bothers you, turn down the treble. For more &quot;oomph&quot;, turn up the bass.)If you're interested in early jazz history, or would like to hear the music that was produced in this revolutionary period, you should enjoy this comprehensive and expertly produced collection.
Getting through this book was like trudging through mud. If you insist on reading it, at least check it out from the library so you won't feel ripped off.I bought this book to read on the train to work after reading a couple of other really great memoirs on the 'highly recommended' shelf at the bookstore. How this book is held in such high esteem by so many readers and critics is beyond me.Mr. Burroughs is a talented writer, and has a knack for bringing the reader right into the situation as if you were really there. But this power should be wielded more responsibly. Burroughs' story, complete with all the gory details, is one that he should have kept to himself.
I purchased this dvd because I had a special occasion coming up and I wanted to look my best. I've been doing my make-up the same way for a decade and it was looking a bit tired and dated. This dvd gave me great ideas for changing my day to day look and also how to look natural but a bit glammed up for my special occasion. The production is high quality, classy and elegant and the application that is done is very clearly shown. It is 85 mins long and is broken up into sections.INTRODUCTION--tools, timeline, basic tips, most common mistake made by brides to be.THE BASIC BRIDE--Ann (blonde, blue-eyed caucasion in her 20's) Here's the make-up demonstration tips applicable to ALL brides. It covers eyebrows (shaping & shading, foundation(prep, proper formula and color, covering blemishes, concealing under eye discoloration,setting with face powder, Eyes (shading for blue eyes), eyeliner (formula and application), lashes (curling & mascara application), blush (contour and blush application),Lips (lipliner, lipcolor, and gloss application). All is clearly shown and explained in detail. Then there are sections for other common facial features, effects and ethniticity. Section #2--Kim is the Modern bride (Asian in her 20's), Section #3--Tiffany is the Sophisticated bride (African-American in her 20's), Section #4--Maria is the Glamourous bride (Caucasion in 30's with dark hair and hazel eyes).Then there are four seperate bonus sections on making your lipcolor last all day, eyes & lashes (including using false lashes), covering up blemishes, and Bridal resources. This dvd is a wonderful tool for anyone wanting a natural look that brings out their own best features but won't leave you looking garish.
This is a cute, fun, humorous book! I am around the same age of the main character, and could relate to most of the situations she ends up in.
Has there ever been a more chilling scene in a "cult movie" than that of Christopher Lee leading his band of pagan islanders in Sumer Is Acumen In? The cinematography is dated, sure, but this one beats the new Nic Cage version by a mile. I originally saw the "long" version when Lion's Gate first released it, but this one catches the creepy essence of that theatrical print.
Good God, man, why on earth would anyone pay this kind of money for a toy car? Get it at Target or Walmart for $3.95. What a ripoff. I can't believe Amazon allows its sellers to charge this kind of money. I love The King as much as the next person, and my son is crazy ga-ga for all things Cars, but if we can't find a particular character at Target then he learns a lesson in delayed gratification. Don't waste your money buying it on Amazon.
Generally, Grisham's books revolve around a good vs evil type of struggle. He seems to abondon that theme in The Brethren, a story about 3 ex-judges (now felons serving their time), a presidential candidate, and &quot;big brother&quot; that is the US government. I found the story very high paced and quite entertaining. In fact, this is probably the fastest I've read a Grisham book.This story focuses on a quite a few characters, none of which are really developed. In fact, none of them, taken on their own, are interesting characters at all. The dynamic established between them however is great. I was really surprised to see how low this book is rating. I personally consider it one of his better books....ah, but what about the ending. I see it something like this. Upon reaching chapter 39, Grisham simply decided he'd had enough of the book and would wrap it up. While I'm disappointed, I've read enough of his books that I wasn't expecting much. Regardless, I'm still giving it my recommendation.
When I started this book, my first reaction was - who are all these authors? I only recognised 20% of the names. Hardly had I thought this then the Introduction told me exactly who they were - very timely.However, as I progressed through the book, there was quite a variance in the quality of the writing. Some authors, such as those on Cosmology, communicated well, but then others were far too high-level for a general audience. It was the latter chapters that brought me considerable delight &amp; education when discussing the Mind, Psychology etc (not my favourite subjects I may add).If all the contributors had tuned their work to the same general audience, then this would have deserved 5 stars; if it wasn't for the redeeming work by the psychologists &amp; neuroscientists I'd have probably rated the book as 3 stars.
The sounds coming off this disc are among the most beautiful ever committed to a mechanical recording device. No, I don't mean the recorded sound -- I mean the sound produced by a living human musician on his piano. This includes such items that no microphone technique can efface, however poor it may be: impeccable legato, perfect phrasing, living inside the music with your imagination, bringing it to life in vibrant splendour. The actual sounds coming out of your loudspeakers may not be as luminous when you compare them to a digital rexording. But this is music-making, not record making! This is Chopin, not musical wallpaper. You have to engage your heart together with your ears, or you'll lose the plot!I can think of only one other Chopin concerto recording in this class:Piano Concerto 1. Very different in spirit, but equally valid. The Second Concerto had no rival to match Rubinstein.So once in a while you must forget your loudspeakers and consider just the music. then you'll appreciate what a miracle this recording is, and you'll be grateful having had the chance to audition it.
I see most people are saying this is a great starter album for the novice Zappa fan. There's something to that, because much of this album is very accessible, especially compared to much of his other, more cacophonous works. However, for the seasoned Zappa listener, this one tends to get a little stale after awhile, mostly because the focus is more on his "offensive" lyrics than on the usual musical experimentation. A lot of the humor seems forced compared to a lot of his other performances, and there is a lot of material here that seems more like filler than anything else ("I'm So Cute," "Jones Crusher," "Baby Snakes"). "Bobby Brown" and "Jewish Princess" have very little lasting value, beside the gimmicky lyrics.But don't get me wrong, there is some great material here; "Rat Tomago" is easily one of Zappa's best recorded guitar solos, and "Yo Mama" is a carefully crafted epic album-closer. Most of the songs, actually, are interesting and creative enough to bear the Zappa name. All in all, this is a good album, but I think the overabundance of dumb jokes gets in the way, and seems like it's just there to provoke people who might be offended. Basically, if you're into Zappa at all, you'll most likely enjoy this.
I can't wait till the 2nd book comes out too see what happens next!
This type of narrative is a relative rarity in the history of the American border, and Arizona in particular. This is not only a woman's perspective but the views and memories of an army wife. The only comparable books that come to mind are the trilogy of Cavalry life by Libbie Custer. Mrs. Custer's books are more polished but more suspect as the information is filtered by her desire to glorify her husband. Mrs. Summerhayes account does not have this weakness and she is more concerned with how the events affect her children and herself. Her description of the Arizona landscape and conditions of Army life stays with you. In particular the sequence in which she is being transported through hostile territory when she is possibly in more danger from her husband than the Indians. This book adds much to the history of the Southwest and is justifiably considered a classic.
This is one of the best books I have ever read. A few years ago, I was in a used bookstore in the New Age section and this book was misfiled in that section. I was raised a Christian, but drifted away in my later years. This is the book that opened my eyes to what the New Age really teaches and brought me back to the Bible and Jesus. Thank you Warren Smith for writting this book!....This is the story of Warren who got involved in New Age teachings and found out that there is a dark side to it and then he found his way out. This is an exciting book for Christians and non-Christians alike. I give it 5 stars.
Boy, having just watched this one I can honestly say it was top ten worst cards ever. It was maybe worse than ufc 9While the SHerk vs Dunham fight was solid, and the Serra Lytle fight was a watchable but rather boring and pointless stand up battle, the other fighters rarely got it on at this show.Save your money
Action adventure the way they should be made. Original, awesome and violent - and none of that Xena sentimentality. Best adventure movie I've seen since the Mask of Zorro.
This album is much cleaner and better produced than any of the prior offerings. It's got better lyrics and better musicianship than any of the later releases. THis was Metallica at its height. They were only poised to fall. Metallica had a sharp rise. Kill 'em all was a strong start, Ride the lightning was a very very good follow up, with Master of Puppets being the single most completely listenable album they released.
I was speaking with another editor about our new G5's. We both lamented the end to our break time; it wasn't long ago that you could hit "Render" and get a half-hour break out of the deal.If you have non-stop work at your door and you value a little free time, buy a slower machine. This thing will make sure you don't have an excuse not to work.
Oh wow, I'd forgotten about this band for so many years, and was delighted to find it here on Amazon MP3. Oddly enough, after listening to all the demos, I found that the most oft-played Bangles hits were not my favorites! I only wanted these four tracks:Going Down To LiverpoolWalking Down Your StreetI"ll Set You FreeEverything I WantedOh sure, Egyptian, Monday, Flame, all good as well, but I have heard them a million times. These others were always in the back seat but in my opinion, they're what made the album really great!
In my opinion, a great album should do one of two things: 1) it should introduce you to something new, and 2) it should stand up to repeated listening. A phenomenal album does both. That's exactly the label I'd give to "Plays Metallica by Four Cellos."I was not much of a Metallica fan when I was introduced to Apocalyptica. I thought it would be interesting for the novelty, so I took it home and gave it a few spins. By the fifth listen, I started to catch all the nuances and craftsmanship in the music, and by the tenth I realized that this was a truly groundbreaking sound.String Quartet Tributes are starting to pop up all over the place; Apocalyptica distinguishes itself from those out-for-a-quick-buck releases by demonstrating, through each of the 8 tracks, a genuine love for Metallica. The music is faithfully reproduced, right down to the vocals, in cello form. In the process, the songs are lovingly elevated from 'just' metal into incredibly artistic compositions.This album made me a diehard fan, not of just Apocalyptica, but of Metallica as well. After hearing these versions, I was able to go back to the originals and experience much more of the depth and layering. From there, I began to enjoy songs that Apocalyptica didn't cover, and a fan was born.This album has stood the test of time for over 5 years now. I wholeheartedly recommend it to fans of Metallica or people looking to try something new. It may surprise you.Incidentally, Apocalyptica puts on an amazing live show. See them if you can!
Three slightly blurred pictures of the girl from Texas once voted: "The Ugliest Man On Campus".From the rising star: Cheap Trills. From her re-invention: I Got Dem Ol' Kosmic Blues Again Mama! From the woman: Pearl.Snap shots of a Shooting star blazing across a less smoggy sky, leaving in her wake Hells Angels, mad club scenes, the Grateful Dead, pretty-boy castaways in bars, empty liquor bottles, alter egos, business deals, personal vendettas, Love, Loss and Loneliness. And I personally believe, Cheech Marian's first crush (but I could be wrong about that).So, take the phone off the hook, pour yourself a tall cool glass of your favorite whisky, put The Wizard of OZ on the tube with no sound, and crank the stereo. Janis wants to reach out and touch your soul.
I just received this table and am quite pleased with it. I ordered it directly from Target and received free shipping plus they had a promotional discount so it was a really good deal. I had my doubts when it arrived because the box was kind of beat up but the table was packaged quite well and there was no damage at all. The table is extremely easy to assemble. It literally took about 10 minutes to put the entire thing together and you don't really even need the instructions because you can tell just by looking at it how it goes together. The table feels solid and the covertible aspect is a really nice feature. It unfolds easily and when folded, you can't really tell it can be expanded unless you look closely. This table could easily accommodate two adults or 4 children. The finish is a dark oak stain on solid wood, not cheap particle board like most ready-to-assemble furniture. It feels very sturdy and looks great. Overall, I am extremely pleased with this table and recommend it.
A freind and I were listening to part VIII one night and I mentioned that I thought it amazing that a vocalist and saxophones could keep up without rests He replied, &quot;There are saxophones and a vocalist?&quot;The musicianship on this CD is just amazing. The problem is that people treat it as a whole and try to listen all the way through. Trust me, you don't want to do that. Listen to each track as a seperate piece. You'll like it a lot more.It never stops amazing me how through the 'repetition' there could be so much forward motion. Glass does a phenomenal job keeping your attention (if you let him), therein lies the problem. Glass requires you to 'relearn' how to listen to music in a sense. If you're wanting crescendos, swells and climaxs, there's nothing for you here, but if you're willing to 'relearn', there is nothing so rewarding. And if you like this, you'll love 'Einstein on the Beach.
Another well written novel by Iles with well developed characters that define an author with exceptional writing abilities. This being said, the plot was problematic as you had to suspend your disbelief when an action was taken that was not realistic. Many times as I was reading and a character started to do something, I would think, "Damn don't do that or ...... is going to happen," and then it would happen. Too many implausible plotlines.I was surprised with the many negative reviews about this book. Regardless of how distasteful some aspects of the story might be, like a middle age man having an affair with a seventeen year old high school senior, the novel is well written so I give it four stars.Author of al-Qaeda Strikes Again
THIS BOOK IS ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ. THE THINGS WE COMPLAIN ABOUT IN EVERY DAY LIFE SEEM SO TRIVIAL AFTER YOU READ THIS STORY OF SURVIVAL. WHEN YOU FINISH THIS BOOK YOU WON'T SEE YOUR LIFE IN THE SAME WAY AGAIN. IT'S UNFORGETTABLE.
At first glance, the artwork on this tarot deck may not seem like much.But it has a deep and rich history: Native American ledger art.Its primitive art truly is along the lines of ledger art. I highly recommend reading the companion book, as it will add immeasurably to your enjoyment and understanding of the cards.It is a primitive deck and it meant to be as such. See plainsledgerartDOTorg which will better explain ledger art.This marvelous round deck by Stella Bennett does not use traditional suits, but instead uses Thunderbirds (Fire/Wands), Frogs (Water/Cups), Butterflies (Air/Swords), and Turtles (Earth/Pentacles). Because it is round, you can read -- instead of just one upside-down method of reversals -- an entire 12-hour "clock" position of reversals, in ill-dignified form. Many tarot readers have their own systems for this.Highly recommended.~~"I want to die peacefully in my sleep, like my grandfather. Not screaming like the passengers in his cab." &lt;&lt;
Led Astray is a long and thoughtful book, but don't let it's length scare you. It grabs and holds your attention with plenty of action, but takes the care and skill to make you intimate with not only her lead character, Kelly, but the other principles. Even some of the more minor characters are clearly developed without being tiresome or pedantic. To add spice, her erotic scenes are varied and hot, and her understanding of total power exchange thorough. This book was worth every minute it took to read, and sometimes kept me from things I should have been doing!--Penny Duff, Brandon, Florida
This is the second book of Ms. Shreve's that I have read. I really like her writing style, which tends to swing towards the poetry side. This really draws the reader into the novel.
This series definitely has potential. I'd really like to see more of the SEAL trio -- James, Beau &amp; H.J. With James getting crapped on, Beau the wise-cracker and H.J. trying to prove herself as a lady SEAL, a lot of interesting things could happen. The plot to rid the Med of American influence was pretty good, especially since it's carried out by one sharp, evil Libyan colonel. A very good adversary for the U.S. to face. Some of the best scenes involved the Algerian revolution, especially with the loyalists trying to get the President out of the country while encountering all sorts of hairy situations. I really enjoyed the battle scenes at the end. Very fast-paced and well done. Looking forward to the rest of the Sixth Fleet books.
Like the first book, this one is just riveting. Tolken does a fabulous job drawing you in to the story.
Surely this is a promising concept. DeNiro, Reno, Bean, guns, cars, intrigue, secret suitcases, explosions, doublecrosses, and a partridge in a pear tree. With the amount of time and attention that's obviously been lavished on the production, what could possibly go wrong?To me this movie possesses a severe crisis of purpose. People come, people go; people get shot, people - erm, get shot anyway. There seems to be a complete lack of viewer attachment to the film - we tend not to care one way or another about any of the characters because as soon as we do? Bam, they're gone. All the action, frantic and tense as it is, just seems slightly irrelevant, since they're all going to die anyway.On the plus side, direction and acting is generally good, and the scenery is naturally wonderful. The &quot;Ronin&quot; legend of the title is intriguing, but clumsily handled, so we're left wondering whether it's really relevant. In short, slick production values can't substitute for real emotion in this rather faceless thriller.
I have to agree with the other reviewers here, this is a pretty good place to start with the Dots, although I dont actually own this disc I do know all the tunes and this is a great selection.Some may feel it lacks at least one Premonition (not sure if I can describe one accurately)the longer ,weirder soundscapes side of the band but what you do get is pretty wonderful.The danger for the obsessives amongst us (who me ?) is that after hearing this we will want ALL the Dots we can get our hands on.But if that happens you can always give this disc to a deserving friend and set them on the path too.Enjoy
I have used it to blow potentially abrasive dust off lenses before swabbing them with alcohol q-tips to clean them. I also used it to blow a speck of steel stuck on my eye. It wouldn't flush out with water but this puffer had enough force to blow it off the cornea. In other words, it's great for blowing off delicate lenses!
Have you ever gotten groggy in the afternoon (especially after a big lunch)? I know I am guitly of fighting sleep in the afternoon. I have tried several different products and this one works the best, and with no side effects. However, even these pills don't help enough if I didn't get enough sleep the night before, so it is no substitute for a good nights sleep.
I disagree strongly with MUTIMAman on this CD. In my opinion, any Allman Brothers greatest hits package that does not contain &quot;It's Not My Cross To Bear&quot; is a total waste of time and this is the only one that has it...aside from the box set. &quot;Cross&quot; is , in my opinion, the best blues song ever laid down on vinyl. I have been a professionl musician for almost 30 years now and am still amazed at the passion and tastefulness of the lead vocals and guitar solos in that song. I rarely find a greatest hits package that totally pleases me, but this one does. Buy it and you'll see.
I've read this book twice. Once when I was younger, and again recently. It was what I would consider a Good book. Hogan always seems to turn out an entertaining book, a book worth reading, but not a Snow Crash. I could read this book again when its turn comes up. Worth buying and reading.
"Take me to the River" was the first Talking Heads song I ever heard, being a huge radio hit way back when. I got around to buying this album a couple years later (along with Talking Heads 77) I only wondered "why that song, when there are so many better ones on the record?"That being said, this album is chock-full of great songs, and with great production to put them across. Worth every cent!
I couldn't even finish it. Not a single character was likable. If you want to read a good book, read Annie On My Mind.
I read about this book in Time, and found myself very interested in reading it. When I finally got the book and opened the first page, I knew this would not, at all, be a happy fairy tale. (After all, it is about a Haiti prison guard).The story begins with the guard's daughter, a young woman named Ka, in a hotel room with her father, holding with her a sculpture, intending to give it to a famous Haiti woman. But her father smashes it, ruining it, and then confesses to his daughter that he's not the man she always thought he was. Instead of being a prisoner in Haiti, he was a torturer, and he was good at it.This changes the story. At first, I thought, hey, you know, maybe the man could repent his sins. Maybe he became good...But as the novel progresses, you realize that this man, no matter how much he has repented, did terrible, horrible, awful things. And no matter how he tried to forget him, they still haunted him, tried to make him pay for his wrong doings.In a sense, he did pay. At the way end, he gets a long gash in his face, making him look like a monster. And maybe he is.This was a brilliant book. I was truly impressed with Danticat's writing. The only reason I gave it four stars though, is that sometimes, the switch and introduction between characters was rather confusing at times. Otherwise, this was an amazing book. It's a little slow at the beginning, but if you wait, it gets better. The ending is the most shocking part in the entire book. I was stunned. This is an incredible book, and I suggest it to anyone who wants a great novel.
Along with &quot;The Stranger Beside Me&quot; and &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, one of the best of the true crime genre. Fascinating, detailed, wholly involving. One of those wonderful read-till-4:00 am books.
Dr. Allan Stavely has done for the Cleanroom Software Engineering method what Martin Fowler did for the Unified Modeling Language in his book &quot;UML Distilled.&quot; He's analyzed the best and most useful parts of the Cleanroom method and found a great way to present them. After reading this book, you'll be controlling defect rates and shortening development times on your own software projects.For those not in the know, the Cleanroom method is a set of practices pioneered by the late Harlan Mills. The idea is to use some simplified mathematical formalism along with group verifications. The result? You shift time away from hack-and-slash debugging towards review. Often, the entire start-to-finish development time is shortened.With object-oriented languages and template instantiation times, this is a really good thing: the compile-debug-test cycle is far too painful and too slow to support today's shortened deadlines.The key to Cleanroom is that the mathematical formalism is simplified and &quot;just enough.&quot; Stavely demonstrates the typical structures found in programs and shows how intended function statements (the math part) are used in the group review (the verification part) to discover defects in the code. Later, a testing group exercises the paths through the code that users are most likely to take, giving statistical metrics on mean-time to failure and feedback into the quality of the method's practice.Stavely's conversational writing style makes grasping the material efficient. Each chapter focus on just one aspect of the method, and exercises at the end test how well you grasped the material. Although Stavely includes hints to the answers for selected questions, I would've preferred complete answers to all the questions. That'd make the book more useful outside of a classroom setting.Transcripts of review sessions show how the method succeeds in the group review. Although hypothetical, Stavely based them on actual review sessions taken by his coworkers and students over the years. They help guide newcomers to the method on how to conduct the verification step.Overall, this is a great introduction to the Cleanroom method and after finishing the book you'll be able to introduce it to your own group in no time. Buy a copy for everyone on your team!
The book "Dying to Get Married" was, in my opinion, pretty good. I liked it, but I didn't love it. It's better than a lot of other true crime books out there that I've read. I think it's more the topic than the author's writing that makes me give it a lower rating. It is well written, fast-paced, and easy to read. I would recommend this one as it's clearly better than average. This one is not a keeper. I just don't like it when the the killer gets off easy. I know it's not the author's fault. Just my opinion.
Doesn't fit extra large chairs. The material used in making the item is excellent.
This CD is beautiful. I very rarely even buy CDs, but this one was worth the money. I regret that I waited so long to get it. I don't understand why so few people own it (none of my friends do). I'm not even a fan of Techno, or whatever you call this, but there's something irresistable about the sound.
This is exactly the type of movie I'm trying to avoid. I have no idea how I came into possession of this but keep it far away from me.
...middle schoolers and discussed with parents and peers BEFORE moving into high school...I've been out of high school over thirty years but still recognize people and situations that I had to deal with totally unprepared...and I suspect from what I've read and seen reported that high school probably is worse now in even more respects than what I experienced...
The creators of Age of Empires brought us Age of Mythology! Then after that, they made the expansion pack. Years later, Age of Mythology and the X-pack was put in one box and was called "Age of Mythology: Gold Edition". And a while later, I got the game. Now, you should get the Gold Edition, it is worth the $30. But on with the review!You start as 4 Civilizations (3 is added in the X-pack). 3 Major gods are in each civilization. Each god has different powers and abilities. And to advance in many ages, you must pick a minor god to advance to the next age.Greeks:ZeusHadesPoisidonEgyptians:RaIsisSetNorse:LokiThorOdinAtlanteans:GalaKronosOranosThose are the major gods that you can pick. And that isn't just that; you can get a ton of myth units: minotaurs, scyllas, scorpion-men, Anbites, and more. And did I not tell you that minotaurs and cyclops can throw men?Several god powers are in your hands! From lighting, earthquakes, to tornadoes and meteors. They can be used once (Atlanteans can use some powers twice or more.) Tornadoes are my favorite because when they enter a city, the devastation is heart-breaking for the enemy and their allies.100 scenarios, online play in Ensemble Studios Online, and a map editor cannot bore anybody who is willing to play hard. Although I won a victory online after I bought the game because I was used to playing that hard. I like playing Ra because the pharoh and his priests can empower buildings and if you are attacking, the chariot rush is pretty good, and if you like defending, you should make elephants because a small number of elephants can hold out a large number of humans. Teamwork is very important to win a game, and did I not tell you that when you have an island, to put towers and forts on every part on the island. I lost my titan gate because I didn't save it. And what are titan gates? Titan gates and special and take a long time to build, and when it finishes, a powerful titan will be freed and they can turn the tide of battle! A single titan has 7000 hitpoints! But you can only create one! And really defend it because you could lose it to enemies. Always build heavy defence when building a gate, and when playing online, expect attacks.If you are a RTS man who needs some chocolat for their ice cream, then AoM: Gold Edition is the chocolat of ice cream.
I remember years ago hearing people say how Grant Morrison saved and revitalized the JLA. As a matter of fact I still hear people say this. Some consider his JLA stories to be groundbreaking epics of altered consciousness painted on a grand scale. His work on JLA was a very popular in terms of sales and fan reaction. But I have to ask am I the only one who finds this more than a little puzzling? I have now read all six JLA trades comprising Morrison's run on the title and I don't see what all the praise is about. I will grant that his use of the White Martians at the start of his run was an interesting idea but it didn't amount to much in the end. And that I see as a consistent trait with his JLA work. He seems to insist on working on a huge canvas when from what I can tell he is not much beyond paint by numbers. His stories are choppy and inconsistent leaving the reader wondering what's going on from moment to moment. In his stories he plays with our perceptions of dimension, time and consciousness with often little regard to characterization. I think he is more concerned with creating some grand catastrophe for his characters to battle than he is in making the story actually work for the reader.This trade which reprints JLA 34-41 concerns the formation of a new Injustice Gang and the imminent threat of a 15 billion year old galaxy destroying doomsday weapon called Mageddon. This is yet another Grant Morrison tale that goes through the motions of giving you lots of action but very little story. We are told that this Mageddon is an unstoppable doomsday weapon that causes those of an evil nature to wage war against those of a good nature until all are corrupted by its influence. But before the JLA can face Mageddon they have to deal with the Injustice Gang. After bypassing the JLA's security measures the Injustice Gang decimates the Watchtower leaving the team in disarray.Now this brings us to the character of Prometheus. Morrison has described this character he created as "the anti-Batman." As we all know Batman trained himself to be a weapon against crime after seeing his parents killed by a criminal. Prometheus trained himself to be a weapon against law after seeing his criminal parents killed by the police. He created a helmet that feeds the skills and abilities of others he keeps stored on compact discs directly into his central nervous system. He confronts Oracle in her clock tower and offers to use his technology to restore her legs if she will betray the JLA. When she refuses he knocks her through the face of the clock leaving her hanging on to one of the clock hands. When we see Oracle again next issue she is safe and sound back in her wheelchair inside the clock tower but we never find out how this happened. I guess this happened in one of the Batman related books. It would have been nice if Morrison had made some mention of how she survived since she had no way to call for help.Despite having no weapons available Oracle somehow managed to damage Prometheus' helmet when he attacked her. During a previous fight the JLA had with Prometheus Batman had captured one of his helmets and ran tests on it to find out how it worked. When he returns to get his spare helmet he knocks out Huntress and is then confronted by Batman. During their fight Batman pulls out a device that rewrites the information on his disc leaving him helpless. Why would Batman even bother to fight him if he didn't have to? This doesn't sound like the master strategist Batman is supposed to be.I would have given this trade a one star review if not for the Spectre story in issue 35. It concerns Hal Jordan trying to find a way to balance his role as The Spectre against his humanity. It's an interesting story that shows some members of the JLA could be open to judgement by the Spectre. J.M DeMatteis wrote this story.Having now read Morrison's work on JLA I'm not inclined to try anything else of his. If over reaching convoluted stories are your idea of good comics you may just like Grant Morrison's JLA. But if you prefer your comics have great stories and well written characters I suggest you buy Kurt Busiek's Avengers stories or his creator owned work in Astro City. You'll be glad you did.
This hammock provides the ultimate relaxation. It has a heavy duty castaway rope and the wooden bar keeps my hammock open. My boyfriend and I enjoy swinging in it. It's very durable.... The hammock was obviously designed for comfort and we've had it outside during hot weather and rain, it's still strong. I really like my hammock and recommend this to anyone who wants to lay around and relax or read outdoors. The price is good, too.
This is the second book in the roma sub roma series that takes place between the two novels. This is a good book but most of the stories are forgettable. The best short story is the namesake of the book about the potential sexual escapades of a vestal virgin which would lead them to be executed. Very good book that bridges together the two novels but nothing really exciting.
This is just the right size for a medium to large cup of tea. I prefer loose leaf tea but I don't think steel tea balls let enough water flow for good brewing. This filter does the trick. My wife has the larger size as she likes to brew a couple quarts of tea at a time for iced tea. It also works great.
...or perhaps even any human language. Never has the mind of man conceived of such a self-indulgent exercise in deliberate obscurity, empty artifice and lexorhea. SPOILER: Its a book about itself. The book. A literal literary circle j@rk. Ooooooooo so deep and worthwhile - NOT.I love novels. I love the evolving form of the novel, from Swift and Defoe through Austen, Scott, Dickens, Twain, Wells, Hemingway, Joyce, Faulkner, Burroughs, Brunner and beyond. This is a crime against the concept of the novel. It is abomination.I burned my copy. That does not make me a book-burner, Delaney's monster doesn't count. Sometimes I wake up at night in a sweat, shaking in horror remembering this un-book. I wish I could burn the memory of it out of my brain. Burning my copy will have to do.
This is one of the most realisitcally put together war movies ever made about World War II. It is very contraversial because it was done from the point of view of German soldiers, but only a fool would see this thing as pro German or pro nazi. The poltiics of the movie are simply, if anything, anti war and anti authoritarian.But what many reviewers miss, is the biting realism of this movie. The tanks (real T-34's) the fighting, the explosions, the confusion are all chillingly real, and frightening. You really get a sense of fear and danger from this which you just don't from Hollywood.But perhaps what is most interesting, is the personal crisis of individuals caught in harms way, which is so often the focus of Pekinhpahs better movies, from "Straw Dog's" to "Bring me the Head of Alfredo Garcia". This film focuses on the way different people react to emergencies, horror, and facing the ongoing threat of imminent death. If you have ever been in a life or death situation you will recognize the way some people think fast on their feet, some people rise to the occasions, some falter and hesitate, others drift into fantasy or insanity.... This is where it is most interesting psychologically.I would also add, that this is one of the few movies I have ever seen on WW II in which the Soviet Army is portrayed as the immenssely powerful war machine which it was in the second half of the war.Other than a general (small l) libertarian mood of distaste for all forms of authority, forget the politics. This movie has nothing to do with being for or aginst certain groups of people, or anything like that. It is simply a chillingly realistic war film, and as such, something many people more used to standard Hollywood fare just don't get. If you like war films but are disapointed by a lack of realism, if you liked Paths of Glory, Das Boot, When Trumpets Fade, (the original) Alls Quiet on the Western Front, Hamburger Hill, Apocolypse Now, The Longest Day, The Last Valley, and the Samurai -War films of Akira Kirosawa (such as Ron), to name a few, you will love this one. If you prefer bubblegum fantasy like "pearl harbor" and "U571" and the war films of John Wayne, or if you put some kind of political litmus test on all movies on who they can portray and who they can't, you may not...
This product was tried on a thumb sucker and a nail biter. It did not work for either.I felt terrible after using it, it made my 7 year old vomit. As for the thumb sucker, he didn't care, he just kept right on sucking his thumb. The smell of this stuff is very, very strong. If the child touches ANYTHING, the taste and smell will get on that item. If your child, for example, is going to eat a banana, they will get the taste/smell of this in their mouth/nose. When it is on, it's hard to have their hands even near your face, it's so disgusting. I would never put this on another child. Even as an adult, just lifting your coffee cup to your face you'll be able to smell it, get the taste, from your hands. We can't recommend this for any child and will keep looking for solutions to our thumb sucker and nail biter. I was hopeful after reading the reviews, but we are deeply disappointed. This is just awful.
Georiga Gibbs is opportunist thief.Some of her biggest records were exact, almost note for note covers of versions done by black singers of the 50's.Ruth Brown, LaVern baker, and Etta James were all victims of this woman.She covered their superior versions almost note for note, right after the originals started up the pop charts.Radio dj's were quik to make to room for Georgias versions because (in my opinion) she was white. Georgias versions not only out sold the originals 100 to 1 they in a sense stopped the originals from living up to their full potential as singles.I know many R&B; artists could not stand her for this reason.Quite frankly I understand. She is not as good and could never have been as good as these pioneering women. If you want to hear more vibrant,soulful versions of many of the songs she covered look up the original versions by the original artists. ie. Dance with me Henry (aka Roll with me Henry, originally done by Queen of the Blues Etta James in 1955)and Tweedle Dee (originally done by LaVern Baker in 1955)They are superior vocally. Even though their versions were buried after Georgias flooded the markets, LaVern, Etta,and Ruth are, were and will always be more repected,revered, and looked up to. Remember there is only one original. The artists Georgia covered were pioneers, they did it from their souls.Georgia exploited them.Look up the originals.
This book is the definitive work on candlestick charting techniques for stocks and futures. The author gives example of the different patterns and explains the reasoning and psychology behind the price behavior of the patterns. This weekend, I am rewriting all my stock monitoring applications to include candlestick pattern recognition logic... And I'm looking for &quot;Morning Star&quot; or a &quot;Sanpei&quot; &lt;grin&gt;
I do think that this album is different then the first. But the mark of a true artist is expansion, and we must remember that God's annointing often causes you to grow and expand. Change and growth, does expand a gift of God. I love Tye Tribbett and GA, and I believe it was said best on the cover of this CD, WE must remember this is not R and B Hip Hop or Neo soul this isKingdom Music. And it is about HIS worship and his praise and HIS annointing. Listen to this CD with an open mind, and you will feel the true presence of GOD. Don't be concerned with comparison, GOD is doing something new with this CD, but hey praise GOD for Change. I encourage everyone to get this CD, you will be encouraged uplifted and renewed, and brought closer to the presence of GOD. Be Blessed.
The story was well written, characters well developed, but it seemed a little too unrealistic at times. I don't see how a 17 years old absorbed so much street knowledge so fast, especially when he was a prude. The sex scenes were unrealistic as well or maybe I'm just too old-fashion? Anyway, I think men would enjoy this book more than women, since it was written mainly from a male perspective.Readers that are into hardcore street lit will enjoy the read.*Loved the book cover. The first book that I've seen that looked like the characters described in the book*Overall rating: 3.5
Although the author is not elaborate in his character development, by the end, I was in tears. Do you realize how hard that is to do? There are a couple of scenes in the book that haunt me. This book is not for all... but I really enjoyed it.
This game has much better illustrations and easy-to-follow explanations of how to actually play the games than the other children's books I have used with my scout troop.
The second in the venerable British ITV Sharpe series, and one of the best. Sean Bean is Richard Sharpe, a dashing, swashbuckling hero in the Napoleonic Wars. Or, as the UK television station UK Gold calls him, the "Nineteenth-Century James Bond".This one finds our hero under the command of - let's face it - a jerk of a commander, the cowardly Sir Henry Simmerson. Events transpire that convince Sharpe he must capture an Imperial Eagle, the standard of Napoleon's army, and touched by "Boney" himself. Of course, there's no shortage of lovely ladies, either, with Theresa (played by Assumpta Serna) and Josefina (Katia Caballero), a lady in a compromised position whom Sharpe gallantly rescues.The cast are quite enjoyable in this one, with Brian Cox as the conniving but genuninely nice Major Hogan, Daragh O'Malley as the loyal but fiery Sgt. Patrick Harper, and Michael Cochrane in a brilliant turn as the really, really, really *nasty* Henry Simmerson. And, of course, Sean Bean as Richard Sharpe - the quintessence of the swashbuckling but tender hero. Splendid stuff.Mel Gibson may have to ask What Women Want, but Sean Bean apparently knows...Richard Sharpe!
One of the last great films of that remarkable era of film-making--the 1970's--"Julia" stands the test of time as a testament to heroism in drastic times of collusion much like our own. We know the bad guys but think we are too weak to stop them--to make a difference--but the story of "Julia" gives us strength to at least try. I was about to say the films of today do not have this power, but after experiencing the power of some of this year's extraordinary films like "Good Night, and Good Luck," "Brokeback Mountain" and "Syrianna" I find hope in the modern arena. Keep the faith.
This is the weakest TOOL effort that turned me off of this band that I Use to adore!
I bought this card to take on my 15-day Yucatan vacation. I shot about 300 photos. When I got home and inserted the card into my card reader, Windows Explorer recognized the full range of photos. I selected all to copy, and after copying about 3 photos there was a pop-up saying the drive was empty. Go back and look at the drive in Explorer, it looks empty. The only way I could get those photos off the card and onto my PC was to copy 3 at a time, put the card back in the camera, delete those 3 from the card in the camera, upload the next 3. I eventually got all my photos, but that was NOT a fun project.The card is now in the electronic waste pile.
how can everybody say this is one of the offspring's worst albums? i love this CD! in fact, it's just as good as smash to me. i see some people rate the songs individually, so i think i will.1. Welcome - 2/5 Whatever. i like the intro on smash better.2. Have You Ever - 5/5 One of the best songs. It's pretty long, but that's not a bad thing!3. Staring at the Sun - 5/5 Another excellent song!4. Pretty Fly (For a White Guy) - 5/5 I love this song too!5. The Kids Aren't Alright - 4.5/5 Almost as good as the ones above.6. Feelings - 4.5/5 Very good.7. She's Got Issues - 4/5 Good. Funny.8. Walla Walla - 4/5 Good.9. The End of the Line - 3/5 Not as good. But good!10. No Brakes - 3/5 Same.11. Why Don't You Get A Job? - 6/5 Best on the Album!12. Americana - 4.5/5 Very good.13. Pay the Man - 4.5/5 long but good.that's about it, just a second while i add up the total...54.5/65! Very good!
No-one seems to have mentioned a major flaw with the Cruzer Titanium. The (admittedly very stylish) metal casing can cause electrostatic discharges. This usually occurs just as you are about to insert the drive into your computer. If this happens, not only will all data on the drive be zapped, the drive will become completely unusable.It's a shame: the drive looks great and I hate putting my data on the flimsy plastic alternatives, but once you've been zapped, you'll never by a Titanium again.
Facinating treatise of the alchemical symbolism of many European cathedrals. A sometimes challenging read. I often had to take a break in order to absorb his writing.
Good Stuff1. Aliens are unique2. Nulear wars3. Cataclysmic weaponsBad1. Thin Plot2. Too many characters3. Very Very Slow beginning and middle4. Story gets better around page 4005. Bad ending
Exceptional book, if in doubt, buy it. I knew it would be great after reading so many positive reviews, for some years, and was not disappointed. Unlike some overly detailed biographies, every word seems worthwhile here, from that first glorious sentence to the last. Here is the great adventure story of all time, biology-wise. All I can do is add my two cents worth to what is said elsewhere, don't miss this one.
&quot;Sins of Comission&quot; is a novel by Susan Wright, who I think is one of the most two-faced trek writers out there. The quality of her work varies astronomically. This novel, wich is set somwhat after the episode 'Cost of Living', offers character exploration in it's best.The book puts the characters under telepathic influence, makin it possible for the deepest aspects of their psyche to surface.One of the affects is that the Enterprise crew isn't a one big happy family anymore, but is facing a situation where all the family members don't necessarily get along. This is done with great expertice and not compromising the believability of the characters one bit. They are not different in any way and every bit as real as they are in the TV series. Maybe even more real.The book does also a wonderfull job in promoting characters left aside in the series. Deanna and Worf are slightly more prominent characters than the rest, and ecpecially Deanna is portrayed extremely well. Worf also gets some extremely good scenes.This book shows the battle between open mindet and concervative views as portrayed by the intellectual Counselor Troi and the 'primal' Liutennant Worf, and does this with respect to both of thr characters.Although Troi and Worf are heavily portrayed, this book explores many of the main characters of TNG. And does that very well. The plot though, while intriquing, isn't as good as it might have been, but it holds well.A recomendet read.
This book left me in tears. Although I read the back of the book and had an idea what it was all about I still cried. Allison is a teenager who has a best friend name Isabel or Izzy as she is called. Izzy has been going to do a lot tests and just letting Allison believe it was routine onlyu to be told that Izzy has brain cancer and does not have long to live. Allison is deeply hurt and vows to fight this true with Izzy. Enters Sam a new kid in school that every one is making up rumors about because they dont know the truth, Allison becomes infatuted with him after he has an accident near her on his motorbike. Because of Izzy sickeness Allison fights with wondering whether to tell Izzy about Sam, as time goes by Sam and her begin to fall in love. When she eventually decide to tell Izzy about her romance she realizes Izzy likes Sam and so the story continues to unwind were Allison begs Sam to romance Izzy since she begins to like him. At first he cannot believe she ask that of him but then he does it. In the end he ends up truly falling in love with Izzy. This a story about faith, trust, disbelief and sadness. It makes you think what would you do in this situation.
I was going to give thi film a very bad review but I decide not to hurt the feeling of the idiots who made it so only giving it a bad review. If there was anything good about it it must have been during the time when I fell aleep. The story, theme, acting , photography, producing and directing must have been by a group of over zealous christian evangelists. Bits and pieces were borrowed from other sci-fi movies. I hope the people who were involved in making this movie have a second career lined up. Maybe they could get work sweeping streets for Mr. Warner. Did they really get enough money in their church collection plates to finanve this trashy movie?
I sure to love his work--anything he does.This album only has one english song-but sometimes it is better not to be concentrating on words and just let it all flow through you...........
This book has helped me a lot with homeschooling. Unlike other books of prereading activities I have seen, many of the activities in this book can be done with just a parent and child, even around the dinner table (we are a weird family, I know).I have also read Blevins other titles, and I particularly enjoyed Phonics A to Z.
Okay, I am not an idiot. I can read and understand a book. I do ER billing. This book should not be ordered unless you are really into reading technical results of labs and a sad and slightly boring story. Munchausen is a really interesting topic but this book just didn't do it for me. I am sorry for mom and her seemingly adorable little girls. I just found the book unreadable. No pics in my edition. I would have loved to see Sara Shimoda, MD. I felt like I was at work the entire time. The book was work. Not recommended. I think "Sickened" was a much better book on this strange subject.
I just watched GALAXY QUEST for the first time, and must admit that I was pleasantly surprised. A very funny script, pretty good special effects, and perfect casting (led by the great Sigourney Weaver, who somehow manages to transform herself into a hilarously 'bad' actress) are highlighted here. Special mention goes out to Thermian leader Enrico Colantoni for his wonderful performance.This movie lampoons with the best of them - in fact, I found myself often laughing out loud, to a bemused reaction from my family. Good stuff...
The author of this book has managed to find a lot of great photos of various B-47s in different configurations. It's a nice large format book with high-quality printing. Definitely worth getting if you are interested in this aircraft.
I haven't seen the entire series so I can't speak for other Lots to Learn, Preschool videos. I think this is a fun, varied video that would keep most preschoolers interested though I'm not sure if there's enough educational versus entertainment content. That question is really one of a delicate balance because any video producer doesn't want to make something so dry they loose the kids interest, but I would have liked to have seen more topical focus. Nature is such a broad topic. It seemed like so many topics were included that topical depth suffered making this more of a good one time viewer rather than a video one would watch several times to reinforce concepts. In most regards I liken this video to what's currently on Sesame Street without the puppets, commercialism or subtle political messages. Which is to say I think if PBS offered this or Sesame Street, Sesame Street would probably slowly go off the air.My only criticism is that this video is really geared toward preschoolers who can already talk and have a fair grasp of nature concepts. I had hoped this might appeal to my child who is just building words and has yet to put two of them together. You really can't tell that about this video until you begin watching. That said, I highly recommend borrowing, renting or checking out a copy from the library for a preview before purchasing.
Why certain editors feel that it is a moral and worthy act to rewrite classics is really beyond my comprehension as a philologist, author, and editor myself. This was done, horrendously, with MY UTMOST FOR HIS HIGHEST by Oswald Chambers, and now this Chadwick fellow has destroyed FOXE'S BOOK OF MARTYRS in the same way, by rewriting this classic in dumbed-down postmodern English (if it can be called that). The back cover matter even states that he has done violence also to WITH CHRIST IN THE SCHOOL OF PRAYER (Andrew Murray) and THE IMITATION OF CHRIST (Thomas A'Kempis), among others.Stop. Please, in the Name of Jesus, stop. Leave the classics as they stand. You are helping no one by re-writing books written in English easy enough to read already.
I have all the Lesley Gore compilations, and this is the best one. Whereas all the other compilations were put together by record companies and include the most obvious songs, this one was put together by a true Lesley Gore fan, and therefore includes some really interesting stuff.For one thing, this is the only compilation that has Lesley's sizzling rendition of "No Matter What You Do", a very wild and passionate song that totally rocks out with a nasty guitar solo. Not a song one would normally associate with Lesley Gore. She and her background vocalists sound as if they're at a Chippendales performance after having been stranded on an island for ten years. Would've been a hit, except it was too "hot" for 1965 AM radio. I have to blow a fan on my speakers when playing this scorcher, lest all the wiring melt. Also, "What's A Girl Supposed To Do" is here, which should have been a hit single. This song is classic Barry/Greenwich, in the same class as the hits they wrote for the Crystals and Ronettes.Also, this is the only compilation which includes the superior 45 rpm mixes of "Summer with Sandy" and "Brink of Disaster".Also, you get to hear Lesley sing in German. "Sieben Girls" is a hoot, because Lesley makes it sound as if these seven girls can't keep away from Johnny.Lastly, the liner notes and cover art are really fun to read and look at.Lesley Gore worked with only the best producers and songwriters, and she sang of love and heartbreak, so her music will always be timeless. She was a total class act.
To say A Hunger Like No Other is the best adult paranormal romance I have ever read is a bit weighted since I have not read much in this genre. The reason for this is because I had two bad experiences with adult paranormal romance: Dark Lover by J.R. Ward and Sunshine by Robin McKinley. Both failed me miserably, and ever since, I have ignored this genre completely. The first read like soft-core porn and the second was just so boring.Therefore, when a friend recommended me A Hunger Like No Other, I just brushed her off with one look at the book's cover. I mean, look at it! It screams SOFT-CORE PORN INSIDE. The cheesy summary on the back was no help either. Let me first say that I am not a prude; I do like sex in my books, as long as it is written tastefully. I also love steamy scenes of foreplay. It's just that I get really turned off by books with (1) love at first sight and (2) unnecessary scenes of intercourse in every three chapters. I believe that true love develops over time, not just in a week of knowing each other. Also, if the main characters are constantly having sex, it would seem they are more in lust than in love.I love an author who can create amazing sexual tension without actual sex happening yet. A Hunger Like No Other is exactly this! The chemistry between Emma and Lachlain was very believable (and hot). You will love reading about them. They have some pretty funny scenes that got me laughing out loud. Plus, A Hunger Like No Other has a great storyline with action / adventure! The characters are all very fleshed-out as well, especially Emma's eccentric Valkyrie family. They are all bad-ass yet hilarious at the same time. I was so sad that the story had to end but am glad there are more books to this series, featuring some of the characters from A Hunger Like No Other as the protagonists!I also want to mention that Kresley Cole is a brilliant author. She switches between Emma and Lacklain's POV (point of view) very fluidly in third person without giving each protagonist their own chapter. I read a lot of YA (even though I'm 22), and this feat is usually accomplished through first person narrative and separate chapters. In addition, Cole's writing style was simple yet descriptive enough, making it a very fun read and not a burden on the reader. It seems like a lot of adult novels these days try too hard to be sophisticated and end up straining my eyes and brain.All in all, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND A Hunger Like No Other if you enjoy paranormal romance! It was s hilarious, fun, and sexy ride. However, the publishers should really change the cover to something a little more sophisticated . . . I don't know how many other readers have put off this book because it's a reminisce of bad Harlequin novels.
I first "encountered" Dick DeGuerin, Celeste Beard's attorney, in the 1976 book "Blood and Money" by the late Tommy Thompson. I wasn't impressed with him then and I sure wasn't after reading about his work in the Beard trial.This guy doesn't know where anyone would find marijuana in a college town like Austin?Celeste had her problems growing up, I'm sure, but the woman is just not likeable and I really don't understand why any man would go ga ga over her. I also can't believe how Steve Beard would "hook up" with another woman so soon after his wife of many years died (let the body get cold, for Pete's sake).And why DO these grossly overweight, unattractive, wealthy older men PERSIST in the delusion that bimbos half their age are interested in them FOR THEM?I felt for the twins. Imagine having someone like Celeste for a mother! I also felt sorry for Tracey Tarelton. She was badly used by Celeste, who is a textbook predator.
Good lord... who ever thought of making this movie? Talk about boring and just plain bad. I'm a huge fan of no-budget &quot;b&quot;, or even &quot;z&quot; movies, but there's just no excuse for this tripe. The acting has to be some of the worst EVER, especially Teresa Farley - yikes!There's absolutely no emotion from these people. And the monster... you get such a quick glimpse of it at the very end you can only tell it's a man in a bad rubber suit, which looks more like a halloween mask and a garbage bag. The rest of the movie is just no-reason-for-them-to-be naked girls screaming at the shadow of the monster. Save your money and get a shot-on-video movie with some attempt at creativity instead.
All I can add to the already voluminous comments about this superior book isthat I wish it had been available years ago, during my own social-politicalindoctrination. What ignorance and sheer foolishness it would havesaved me! Instead, my painfully slow liberation from all the "common wisdom","it goes without saying" Boomer-and-before biases that pollute our popular andfaux academic culture would not have crept along so confusedly.Thank you, Jonah Goldberg, for having finally and authoritatively put it alltogether for me. And for you, if you have the curiosity, patience and objectivityto rewind history to the late 18th century and reexamine the roots of everythingwe have been so smugly led into revering as enlightened, progressive, tolerant andmorally superior. Here, at last, is our history, hidden in plain sight for so long,that simply must be learned in order to counter all the offensively puerile dogmasthat assault us from so much irrelevant yet pernicious mass-media and incompetenteducational "systems".Do yourself a favor. The times have not changed all that much.
I repeat: If you have bad knees, stay away from this video and any other that has you do side-lunges. I loved parts of this video, but due to my bad joints was unable to do about a third of the exersizes in it. Look for workouts that are specifically "Low Impact". There are many great ones out there!It also really bothers me that she seems to chastize people for doing modifications. I'm sorry but I can't afford knee surgery right now but I'd like to get fit so I *can't* do things like jumping jacks, side lunges, and other plyometric excercizes that are painful and damaging to my knees. That really turned me off to her as a trainer. If she's a real "fitness expert" she would know that some people *need* modifications and not try and make it seem like those who do are just lazy slackers.If you too got this DVD and find yourself selling it, try any of Cathe Friedrick's "Low Impact" DVDs- they are very challenging (I sweat like crazy!), low-impact, fun, and you will see results without someone judging you about needing low impact workouts!
This rip off shows you what an edited trailer can do it sucks you in thinking this might be a decent horror movie but as it turns out its nothing like the trailer leads you to believe its just a phony documentary type with the usual bad acting and so forth.....Please stop already with this crap its old. I will always tell it like I see it good or badSCOTT M
This movie represents the highest epitome of corniness, futility and null narrative coherence of recent times. This movie is more an unfinished silly cartoon painted by numbers for the joy of "who-knows-who" than an amateur honest failure. Avoid it.
These sheets are awful. They are very scratchy and not comfortable at all. Disappointing since I've bought Renaissance sheets in the past and been happy with them. I will not be buying these again.
Classic mistake many fantasy writers make-- build up characters the reader likes and relates to in the first novels, then try to continue the series through children and other strangers to the reader. Roberson takes this to the extreme, in this convuluded second omnibus. Not worth the time (its long) because our favorite charactrs take a back seat.
I have been a trial lawyer for more that 30 years and was blown away by this book. It makes you look at the craft of litigating in an entirely new light. Every lawyer should read this.
With out a doubt this is the best portrayal of the last hours of Jesus on earth. It is passionate, realistic and overwhelming. It will move you to tears. The greatest story ever told has never been told this greatly. The act of Christ giving His life to save us from ourselves is brilliantly portrayed. It is an excellent synthesis of the four gospels that demonstrates nearly all aspects of his trial and execution. Some of the other people around Jesus are also very well depicted, from His mother to Peter to Judas Iscariot. This gives the film a very &quot;whole&quot; feeling. Truely a wonder!!!A note to address the extremely negative reviews: Please don't let them persuade you into missing this brilliant film. Of the negative reviews that I have read, they are extremely inaccurate in how they portrayed the movie. If you are concerened about the violence in the movie please keep in mind that the vast majority of it happened at Christ's scourging...a scene easily fast forwarded through. As for the claims that the scourging is scene is unrealistic, just remember that the Roman empire was extremely good at torturing and executing people. They had hundreds of years to practice and perfect their art of butchery.
The recurring imagery of Perdido Street Station is of grandiose plans, half-finished, poorly maintained, and nonfunctional. Unfortunately, what is true of the setting extends to that of the novel itself.It's not a novel for everyone. The characters and setting are grubby, dirty, ugly, grasping and selfish. If one gets through the first hundred pages, the hook is set fast and the brilliant story-telling and setting pull one in.The plot, the meandering plot, centers around the cast-off scientist Isaac and his experiment to return flight to a wingless bird-man. The experiment, of course, goes wrong. Dreadfully wrong.But... that's the problem as well. Mieville has crafted a truly vast and fascinating storyscape. The city and people and races of New Crobuzon live and breath with the same fascinating perversity as those of Castle Gormenghast or Melnibone or, dare I say it, Middle-Earth. The first appearance of the Weaver alone makes the story very difficult to put down. The story draws one in.But ultimately, Mieville loses control of his own narrative. Like Isaac's own experiment, the plot goes wrong. Dreadfully wrong. Mieville has to wheel in one of the most obvious deus ex machina devices I've ever seen outside of a Spielberg movie. What follows is a wholly contrived and inexplicable conclusion, accompanied by a sputtering denouement puffed up with its own bizarre self-righteousness. The only thing missing from the end is Fonzie, a speedboat, and a shark ready to be jumped.I cannot in good conscience recommend this book to anyone. If the first hundred pages disgusts, it should be put down. If the first hundred pages fascinate, it should be put down, as the last hundred surely will disgust even more.
Dubbed by Times magazine as one of America's seven best preache's, Harvard professor of Christian Morals and pastor of the school's University's Memorial Church, Rev. Gomes' latest work, The Good Book, is a bestseller selection of the Book of the Month and Quality Paperback Book Clubs. This well-written, compassionate and thoughtful book is written for the general public to entice them back to reading the Bible through new eyes, paying more attention to its moral principles than the social practices.Rev. Gomes asserts that Biblical literacy in this country is extremely rare. Among a thousand people polled in the US by the Barna Research Group 10 percent said that Joan of Arc was Noah's wife, 16 percent were convinced that the New Testament contained the Gospel of Thomas, and 38 percent believed the Old and New Testaments were written a few years after Jesus' death. Gomes observed humorously that, "These replies are worthy of the old Sunday school howler in which the epistles are defined as the wives of the apostles." (p. 5)The Good Book is divided into three sections: "Opening the Bible" wherein Gomes warns against three dangerous and common temptations on Biblical interpretation: (1) bibliolatry, "the worship of the Bible, making it an object of veneration and ascribing to it the glory belonging to God," (2) literalism, "the worship of the text, in which the letter is given inappropriate superiority over the spirit, and (3) culturalism, "the worship of the culture in which the Bible is forced to conform to the norms of the prevailing culture." Section two, "The Use and Abuse of the Bible" is a historical account of how the Bible has been used to oppress certain groups: Jews, women, homosexuals, and minorities. Section three, "The True and Lively Word" explores what the Bible has to say about the good life, evil, suffering, temptation, wealth, science, mystery and joy."In an interview about the book with the Harvard University Gazette, Gomes commented "I would say, one, the Bible is accessible. Two, it takes work. The Bible is not a Reader's Digest sort of enterprise, and you can't simply open it up, as 90 percent of religious people do, and just hope that inspiration oozes out of the page or that you can just figure it out because you're a reasonably intelligent person. But, three, the work pays off because the Bible has to do with issues, both great and small, that are as relevant as tomorrow's headlines."The Good Book is filled with scholarship and imagination, with wit and wisdom sufficient to serve as a road map back to and through the Bible. I join with the former Archbishop of Canterbury, The Right Reverend Lord Runcie, who hailed The Book as "easily the best contemporary book on the Bible for thoughtful people."
I was so intrigued by the emotionally-damaged, yet strong characters and gut-wrenching plot, I didn't even notice the evening go by. Sutcliffe harnesses her talent in this tightly-plotted, twisted tale with a dash of undeniable attraction between two characters who have suffered great tragedies and come out stronger.
Where the Wild Things are is a good movie for you family. My daughter ( who grew up reading the book ) and I went to see it and loved it, The movie maid you laugh and cry. Where the Wild Things are is due to be released in blu-ray on March 2, 2010.
While this book is almost definitely unlikely to happen in real life, I couldn't help falling in love with it.Samantha Madison is sister to Lucy, the most beautiful and popular girl in school and Rebecca, a certified genius. Sam is the girl who has only one friend and wears all black; she's not exactly the most popular girl. Sam is also in love with Lucy's 'radical' boyfriend, Jack. As punishment for selling her (great) celebrity drawings to her fellow students, Sam's parents force her to go to art class. (Which turned out not to be so bad after all.) The next week, instead of going to art class and facing her art teacher who had embarassed her the week before, Sam goes into the music store under the art studio. There she ends up saving the president of the United States from attempted murder. Soon after, Sam realizes her true feelings for the president's son and Jack.I really enjoyed the characters in this book and how well they were explained and drawn. I found all the characters loveable in their own seperate ways, especially Sam's best friend Catherine and Lucy's boyfriend and Sam's "soul mate", Jack. Sam's narrative is fun and humorous and never got old to me. As I said, this book is unrealistic, but interesting and would make a great rainy-day read.~Atalanta
As well as being the first book I read by Fuguet, the back flap of the cover was the first reference to McOndo that I have ever heard. Judging by the brief definition of the genre, I was expecting a work that blatantly attacks Gabriel Garc&iacute;a Marquez, Alejo Carpentier, Isabel Allende and other writers of magic realism while celebrating McDonalds and Coca-Cola. After all, McOndo declares the death of magic realism in Latin America. What I found was a work that agrees wholeheartedly with the uniqueness of Latin American and Chilean culture but is speaking from a different generation.After guessing wrong at the tone of the book, I repeated the mistake after taking a look at the format. Flipping through the pages, the format looks like a list of movies that the protagonist has seen. I got excited thinking that maybe I would read an intellectual perspective on several classics. As it turns out, this is not the case at all. Rather, the narrator uses the films, many of them forgettable B flicks, to locate the times in his life where formative events occurred. The list has nothing to do with building a relationship with the reader and is completely introspective and therefore autobiographical. There are no obvious ovations made to the reader, the ending is neither epical nor moral.This is an exorbing portrait of a Chilean adult looking back at his life and past passions. I get the sense that many of the events described come straight from Fuguet's own experiences, but at this point I don't know enough about the author to be sure. In a way, it is not represenative of all or even most young Chileans. The narrator spends most of his childhood in California and holds a PhD in seismology. But it has a very subtle and captivating style that keeps the reader turning the pages and enjoying what she finds.
There are enough original ideas driving this book (the first in a series) to keep you engaged. The presentation, however, drags frequently, and I found that skimming long sections was the only way to keep moving. In particular, there is a journey through the center of the earth section of the book, which is interminable and not particularly interesting. Interest in the ultimate fate of the compelling three lead characters, Gunthor, Achmed and Rhapsody carry the book where the plot drags. The book also opens with two prequel-style chapters, which are never adequately tied up in the first book. The second book, Prophecy, ties these chapters into the story line, but I was annoyed that the first book left these bits dangling, seemingly unconnected to the main plot. Bottom line, this is a promising series, and I am interested to see what becomes of our heroine/heroes, but along the way I fully expect to skim long passages.
I saw a production of this at University of Michigan which, I might add, was student-directed. It was one of the best theater-going experiences of my young life. People will disagree with me on this for sure, but to me this is probably the last perfect musical. I call it perfect because it's one of those rare musicals whose book and score do not upstage one another; they are both equally fantastic. That's something that's missing from many musicals today. I remember falling in love with the score as well as actually caring about what happened to these characters. It's true that the score by Jason Robert Brown is not immediately memorable but keep in mind that, as one reviewer put it, he is writing theatrical music. Musical theater scores aren't supposed to be a collection of catchy pop songs. They're there to help advance the plot and character development. Plus, PARADE's music is simply too complex to fully grasp in one recording. If you simply look at the sheet music for this show, you'll see why this won the Tony for Best Score. My favorite songs are "Old Red Hills of Home," "It's Hard to Speak My Heart," "This Is Not Over Yet," and "All the Wasted Time." And of course, the story is just beautiful. Ultimately, the show is about the difficult relationship between Leo and Lucille Frank but it's also about how prejudice can still exist and make us blind. Alfred Uhry made the brilliant choice in giving both good and bad qualities to each character in the show. I don't know if it's entirely historically accurate but seriously, name me a play/musical/film/etc. that's 100% accurate. (If want complete historical accuracy, watch a documentary.) PARADE is often regarded as a very dark show due to subjects like prejudice, rape, and even murder. But I think we need more shows like that. Theater is all about taking risks and never holding back. I mean think about it: the first works of theater ever performed were Greek plays and we all know that they did not end on a happy note. Part of the problem, as Stephen Sondheim put it, is that audiences are afraid of being "challenged." They tend to favor shows that are lighter in tone and just used for escapism. I'm not saying shows like that are bad but I think having too many shows like that can be damaging to the reputation of not just musical theater, but theater in general. I'm glad that shows like PARADE exist. And I'm glad that it's now starting to pick up in popularity with performances in colleges and community theaters. It offers serious theater-goers hope that the stage today can still provide us with works that will continue to impact and inspire audiences in ways unimaginable. As it should.
I have been a fan of Cornwell's Scarpetta novels ever since I discovered them long ago. Unfortunately, I can't say that I was pleased with Blow Fly, nor for the record The Last Precinct or Black Notice. There is something missing from the recipe Cornwell has used in the past to create her wonderful novels, and I put down Blow Fly this morning with a sense of revulsion. While I can't pretend to understand why Cornwell chose to take the plot in the direction she has over the last few novels, I have to say that I was sorely disappointed once again- and had hoped that Blow Fly would bring back the old Scarpetta I loved so much.I can't even vocalize what made me dislike Blow Fly so much, but I advise fans of Cornwell's older Scarpetta novels to stay away from this one like the plague. The plot is repetitive a'la the last two books, the characters have lost their spark, and I can't think of any redeeming reasons for you to buy this book. Borrow it from a library or a friend before deciding whether to add it to your collection.
Harem was supposed to be Brightman's return to the pure dance-pop of her "Fly" CD, as she announced "Classics" was the end of her classical-crossover period. Well, the new CD still contains contemporary renditions of classical pieces (afraid to bite the hand that feeds?) and doesn't really tread any new ground or push the envelope in any way, but the good news is that Harem is just plain packed with great, well produced songs...new material from an artist who has her fans dying for more. While "Classics" was basically a waste of time rushed out for Christmas, Harem (despite the hokey middle-Eastern theme) is an enjoyable effort that should garner Brightman new fans and appease the old.Standouts include "Free", co-written by Sarah and talented Sophie B. Hawkins, "Beautiful", a ethereal ballad, and the moody "The War Is Over".A definite must-have for fans of Enigma, Ofra Haza (who's vocals appear on "Mysterious Days") and Sandra...Harem is a winner. Let's hope Sarah goes even further next time, being edgier and rewarding us with more dark, romantic dreams.
This is a great story populated by real-life characters. By the end you really care what happens to each person. Films like this are rare and hard to find.
I have made a living in commercial (income property) real estate for over twenty years. This is one of the best, down-to-earth, specific real estate books I have ever read.The book is divided into three sections. In my opinion the "Annotations" section is the best of the three. Here are 65 very specific commercial real estate concepts. I found their method of calculating loan size based on NOI to be unnecessarily convoluted, but that is my only beef. Here are specific concepts regarding valuing retail properties, leasing retail properties, apartment operation, finding demographic information (in the world of income property, demographics are destiny), etc.The next most useful section is the short long-term outlook for real estate. There is some very good information here.I found the beginning section (autobiographies of 4 very successful real estate investors) to be the least important. Frankly, I'd rather re-read William Zeckendorf's autobiography.This is an extraordinary bargin at $25.

i just received this unit yesterday to serve as a bridge to my Belkin wireless router (the router manual specifies this AP). Cannot get it to talk wirelessly to the Belkin router. I've spent a good deal of time with it including 30 minutes with Belkin tech support, which consisted of someone reading a script to me, arguing about trivial things, and then ringing off before the issue was resolved. Frustrating to say the least. I'm also not impressed with the lack of logging, as well as the wide-open browser access (your SSID and security settings are displayed to anyone without logging in).The manual is sadly out of date and does not match the firmware nor the physical product, which would make setup difficult for an inexperienced user. Belkin would like to have us believe that this is a plug and play product, but this is not the case.generally, this is pretty much a piece of cr*p. I'm trying to get Belkin to RMA it and either replace it or refund. Overall, I'm more impressed with Linksys/Cisco products than Belkin, even in this price range.Update: Belkin issued me an RMA, I followed their instructions to the letter and shipped the product to Canada at my expense. Four weeks later, i got it back, they had refused delivery with no explanation. I chucked the box in the trash.Belkin, you suck. Never ever again.
I know everyone has different interest or opinion. I respect that. Nothing wrong with that. I do love mystery and suspense. I have several favorite well-known authors. For some reason I read this author's books (first two books of the series) and I just lost interest halfway thru the second book and didn't bother finish it. Because I felt that the author was overdoing the character descriptions (unnecessarily wordy with characters as one of other readers had typed on the post) among other things instead of making the story itself or plot more interesting. Who knows the books at later series are much better, I wouldn't know.
Thank you for my case I really enjoy it. It really works for me and I get to organize my cds and dvds. I enjoy it so much that I will be ordering another CD/DVD case for the rest of my dvds and cds. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!! :-)
Personally, there was no use to have a tribute like this. People can enjoy the same songs sung by Aaliyah herself from her own albums. I also feel that the people on there could not sing or sound like Aaliyah at all. The background music of all the songs seemed to be different than the original songs'. Being a great fan of Aaliyah, it was a waste of money for me to buy this. Secondly, a substantial number of people agree that this tribute is a complete flop and an insult to Aaliyah herself. Rest in peace Aaliyah. You will always be in our hearts!
There is no doubt that this is the very best and sexiest Horror movie ever made.See it! Enjoy
Like others before me, I was lead to Ted due, in part, to his lineage. But Teddy is his own man, despite guest appearances by his famed parents. While his dad's guitar work can be felt on an odd cut, you don't think of this as an album by the son of Richard Thompson or Linda Thompson..I found every song to be linkable, some like "Altered State", and the LP closer "Front Lines" jumped out at me more, base don the pure grace of the melody and stronger lyrics, but there are songs, both soft and raucous that fill this CD release with splendor..I have a couple of other things by TT, but will search out all of his albums based on this strong set of tunes. He presents thoughtful words with an emotive voice. His mum joins him on the (hiden track), as they cover a lesser known Everly Brothers chestnut ..This CD is a winner for start to finish.
I have read other books by Dan Brown and it seems he has a formula to his plots. Don't read the rest of this if you don't want to spoil the book. The formula goes like this: guy &amp; a hot chick find something in the earth shattering category and have to tell the world about it. The guy and girl are being chased by a bad guy lackey for said item that could shatter the world. The bad guy lackey is actually being controlled by the person who they run to for help early on/mid way in the book.I do like his books but since I discovered this pattern, I read them for the details he puts in.
This is wonderful After searching in all the stores for a six count muffin, here it was on Amazon. WE LOVE THIS PAN and you wil ltoo. Cleans so nice! You will love this one !
This wonderful book now over 25 years old, is intelligent, learned and easy to read, no mean feat. Fr. Nolan presents Jesus within the framework of His time, answers the questions that nag at the mind of those who are uncomfortable with religious dogmatic explanations. For example, he explains how Jesus and the apostles became actual fugitives who had to hide out and not be seen in towns lest they be arrested. This makes the exchange between Jesus and Peter on the question of going to Jerusaleum so much easier to understand. For many of us raised thinking of Jesus as always robed in white and haloed this book brings Him closer and more beloved than ever. Scholars know many of things in this book, but sadly the faithful know almost none of it. I believe this book is a must read for Catholic Christians particularly those raising children today.
A terrible read. It won an award, so I read it. Now I know you can't trust awards. This work defies genre characterization. It certainly is not a mystery (beyond why anyone would publish it). It is not a thriller. It is not a romance. If any reader can classify it, I would like to hear about it because it stumped me!
A journey by Tiger Cub through the forest. He meets all his friends, the elephant, the snake, the hornbill, ant-eater - they all make beautiful sounds, but none of them are for Tiger Cub - until he runs into his friend the frog - his call needeep-needeep gives cub such a surprise - he lets out a loud roar - &quot; ah that's the sound for me!&quot;The beauty of the book is in it's format - only 5 inches square , in hard, child proof card - alternate pages are either cut-outs showing what's gone before - or in front, with every second page having a transparent window with a bird, butterfly etc. The whole effect gives a magical 3-dimensional experience as the child works his way through the book.My 16 month old son's reads Tiger Cub first thing each morning , and last thing at night - It's his number 1 choice from his 100+ title library (which ranges from Animalia to Zeuss)The only trouble is tracking down more in the series ( Magic - Look Again Books) - our copy was published by Readers Digest Australia in 1995. They cannot help me find more in the series.I'm working my way through the friendly amazon.com forest, and hopefully we will find some more
The Beatles? Sergeant Pepper's? John Lennon, the best writer of the Beatles said that when he was writing "I am the Walrus," he was trying to write like Dylan. Also, from "The Plastic Ono Band" album, Lennon listed, in the song "God," a plethora of icons, etc. who/which he rejected, including "Zimmerman." Methinks, in the latter case, he protested too much; if anything, to paraphrase William Blake, Lennon's folly was in giving up too soon on the Bard from Duluth (not Hibbing).The pure (a word not associated with studio wizards) tension of "Visions of Johanna" gives a clue to why Dylan's artistry transcends popular music (and the band's smokin', too!)."And Madonna she still has not showedWe see this empty cage now corrodeWhere her cape of the stage once had flowedThe fiddler he now steps to the roadHe writes, 'Everything's been returned which was owed,'On the back of the fish trucks that loadWhile my conscience explodes."KA-FREAKIN'-BOOM!And while the Weathermen's explosions showed they needed a moral weatherman - that, like Nietzsche warned, they'd become a monster by trying to destroy another monster - the poet writhed in the shadow of the void, a "creature driven and derided by vanity," proving that greater wisdom only brings greater sorrow. And death's sting will silence the voice of a generation's suffering and the earth will continue spinning, proving that nearly immortal means nearly nothing except, perhaps, greater awareness of man's desperate mortality.No wonder the B.Y. (Before Yoko) Lennon imitated Dylan's pen.More than any other album by anyone, B.O.B. provides a cathartic easel for the musical and lyrical sponge that is Bob Dylan. Long live the King!
This is one of those books that every beginner needs. It starts with the simplest characters with the least amount of strokes and builds on those simple characters to more complex ones. I like the book. I'm an ABC and I find it a useful reference as I am beginning to learn and add more characters to my database.In reference to the other review which is warning people to steer clear of this book; traditional chinese is very useful to know. It is after all the original language that is closest to Medieval Chinese and is the writing which all simplified chinese writing is based. Although, Hong Kong and Taiwan will be switching over to the simplified forms of writing in the next few years, I don't believe that means traditional characters will disappear.
What can be said about Spaced that hasn't already been said. I had never even heard of the show until I saw an article about it on entertainment weekly's website and did a bit of research on it and being that I was a huge fan of Shawn of the Dead and Hot Fuzz I decided to check it out.Best DVD purchase ever. I love this show. I can watch it over and over and over and laugh out loud with every viewing. This show is so well written I consider the writers of Seinfeld a distant second. If I ever hear that they are trying to make an American version of this show I may have to pull a Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back on them and go try to shut it down.My only complaint about this is that they didn't do a third season.
When my daughter opened this on her 1st birthday my immediate thought was - Oh, another keyboard (She got 4 this year). This is one cute toy. It has so many functions that I am sure she will use more and more of as she gets older. It does have a keyboard but also plays individual songs, is a ball drop and teaches cause and effect. Its bright colored and lights up and isnt tooo loud. One HUGE point with me is, it comes with 4 balls. AND its built to STORE the balls when not in use. She has a FisherPrice ball drop toy that the balls are all over our house because there is nowhere to store them.Now granted, my daughter hasnt had this very long so we have not had time to get sick of the main song but so far she really loves it and is exploring all of the different things it does. I believe this toy has staying power. I just wish it was a little sturdier. She tries to pull up on it to put the balls in the top and it topples right over.
This was the first book that introduced me to the works of Pauline Gedge back when I was a freshman in college in 1980. I have read absolutely everything that Pauline Gedge has written since, and it is all nothing less than incredible. I have also read anything and everything that I could get my hands on that was fiction set in ancient Egypt. Everything else pales by comparison. Gedge, far and away has done impeccable research and has painted the most realistic picture of Ancient Egypt in print. No one writing fiction set in this period before or since can match the lush, gilded with gold and intense colour that one finds in her books. &quot;Child of the Morning&quot;, which is about Hatshepsut, is a great read, and a wonderful first novel that established her as a writer. I highly recommend!!
I recently viewed this movie and found it to be far less enjoyable than I had hoped. This was disappointing, as I really like actors Chris Hemsworth and Sean Bean. The story was also set in chicago, and living in the Chicago suburbs, it's always fun to see the local metropolitan area up on the screen. What I was expecting was an action movie with some sort of twist to the end. What I ended up with was a plodding story with a completely unbelievable antagonist. Likewise, the protagonists behave in completely unrealistic ways that just make you roll your eyes and ask "Seriously?" I can't figure out how this movie has received so many high review scores. I'd say it is below average in most every way.
I love it!There are so many books like this; usually the time you spend reading them is time you spend procrastinating on writing the great american novel, and by the time you realize it, you've already wasted quite a bit of time, excusing it as "research." Fah!But not this one. Every time I start to read, I have to put it down and start writing, because it has helped me clear a block.Additionally, this is not the sort of book where you find yourself skimming large chunks of it looking for itemized lists that essentially cut to the heart of the "good stuff." It is all good stuff. You really won't regret reading it front to cover.The excerpts used as effective examples of good techniques really ARE effective examples. The author's points are consistently well illustrated, and you never get the feeling that some unknown author has written a book simply to get some publicity on his/her unheard of cheesy fiction and to procrastinate toward writing the next one. You're immediately struck by the clarity that Scott Bell knows what it's all about.So--enjoy.And probably purchase, too, because this is really a good one to have on hand, as opposed to checking out from the library. It's an excellent investment.
I've tried all 3 Zoe Bars. (Are there more..?) My personal favorite is the chocolate-peanut butter one. I've purchased 4 boxes in the last few months of that flavor and love them as a between meal snack. They are the only thing I've found that can replace sweets for me and with no guilt after eating.BUT...The chocolate ones are not good tasting nor is it a good texture. Too dense, too strange, odd chocolate similarity but not really chocolate and bad aftertaste. Even worse, however, are the peanut butter ones. I gave those away. At least I'll most likely eat these eventually.
What's the point of having a 'search inside' feature when you can't see anything but the index and title pages? This book may have some terrific projects in it, but you'd never know it from attempting to 'browse' the pages online. It's a constant problem - one which makes me nostalgic for bookstores, where one can examine a book before making a purchase.
This was the first Lovecraft book I ever read. In keeping with Penguin's tradition of scholarly presentations of literary masterpieces, this volume begins with an essay by Joshi on Lovecraft's life and works. The stories themselves are fairly heavily laden with endnotes, which, while initially distracting, eventually lead the reader to discover richness in Lovecraft's work which would not be evident at first blush. Prominent among the annotations are explanations of geographical places and names which appear in the stories, together with allusions to works by other authors (most prominently Poe and Bierce) which echo Lovecraft's.This book is highly recommended for anyone wishing a good first glimpse of the masterful mind of Lovecraft.
I really enjoyed this book and thus was surprised to see all the heavy criticism it received. You know that a book is not going over too well when when only 10% or 20% of the readers find the 5-star reviews helpful, which seemed to be kind of a pattern here. Nothwithstanding all that, I loved this book, and would heartily recommend it, although I wonder if males may go for it more than females. Anyway, before I lavish a little praise on the book (which everyone will disagree with anyway), let me get to the flaw (which I will try to do without giving anything away).In any novel, virtually by necessity, certain unrealistic things have to happen; things that are not quite right. If nothing unrealistic happened, then nothing would happen at all, and you wouldn't have a story. This pivotal aspect of a novel was well described by the excellent novelist Donald Westlake as follows:&quot;There are moments in almost any novel when it's necessary to move a character from one position to another, so that you can move on with the story...Once the character is moved into the new position, everything is fine, but in order to make the transition, the writer has to bend somehing out of shape. Some behavior is wrong, some reaction is wrong. It's a rip in the fabric of the novel, but it's necessary to get the story where it has to go...Other writers, reading the book, might notice the lump in the batter, but most readers won't.&quot;The trick in any novel is to try and make this &quot;rip in the fabric&quot; as unnoticable as possible. For me, the biggest rip in the fabric here was in fact a reaction, namely the public reaction to Ezra's work product (and I'm being vague here simply so as not to give anything away for those who haven't read the book, but those who have read the book will know exactly what I mean). That reaction just struck me as totally not credible, namely that such a product would ever, ever work its way into the public consciousness, much less at the speed of the light which this did. It would be one thing if an author was actually trying to be &quot;high-brow low-brow&quot; (like Nabokov's Lolita, Lawrence's Lady Chatterly's Lover or some similar work by a reputable and known author), but Ezra's work (or should we say Isaac's work?) never had such aims for a second--particularly given that it was a paperback with a dopey title and a voluptuous woman on the cover. Thus, I could just never buy into that turn of events even for a second.Despite that, I though the book was great anyway. Maybe I'm just not as sophisticated as those who almost snobbishly put down the writing in the book (or gave it backhanded compliments like calling it nice &quot;light&quot; reading or &quot;summer&quot; reading), but I thought that the writing was great, the characters were great, the book was fuuny, the dialogue was funny--in fact, except for the above problem, I liked everything about the book. It hooked me right from the get-go and didn't let go the whole way through. In short, I recommend it highly.
Like everyone else I can't imagine why the rights-owner of this series won't release full seasons or even a complete series collection. I guess they don't like money. I would incur my wife's wrath and buy it instantly. In the absence of such an offering, I opted to get this 6-disc set just to enjoy some of the episodes (it was under $14 so not too bad). Although I don't regret buying it, let it be known that these are flippers... another thing DVD collectors universally hate. Also, the compression quality I found to be VERY poor. On a widescreen 32" Samsung and when played in either our dvd or bd player, I'm looking at mediocre (at best) VHS quality. At least a few of my favorites are in this set, so if MGM (or whoever now owns the rights) never decides to release any more of this series I'll have some of them.
This is not a real book - but an unedited OCR copy of Steiner's book. This edition is full of typos, sentences and paragraphs that are run together for pages, no chapter divisions or table of contents. I wish I had reviewed what was between the covers within the return period, but I didn't and now I'm stuck with it. I will either have to buy a different version or download the PDF from [...]. This "book" shouldn't be allowed to be sold on Amazon.
PINBALL is a surreal, intense meditation on the relationship of art to the artists that produce it, and the relationship of artists to their audience.Reportedly written in response to JohnLennon's assassination, PINBALL is the story of an obsessive fan's search for the world's most popular rock star, the mysterious Goddard. Goddard does not perform in public; no one has ever seen him, no one knows who he really is. Andrea, the obsessed fan, seduces has-been classical pianist Patrick Domostroy to help her in the search. As the search develops, Domostroy wonders about its true motivation, and begins to understand that the revelation will inevitably be a disappointment. It's the art that matters, not the artist -- but he does not know what Andrea has planned for Goddard once she finds him.Occasionally overwritten and melodramatic, PINBALLnevertheless exerts an almost hypnotic spell on a first-time reader. Domostroy's search takes him from sex clubs to society parties, all of which are acutely observed, as is the character of Domostroy himself.Domostroy is the novel's most fully developed character; others appear more as archetypes than as real people. This is only appropriate, however, when one considers PINBALL as an allegory, a fable similar to the story of the goose that laid the golden eggs. PINBALL repays multiple readings, and lingers in the mind long after the last page is turned.
The production and performances in 'Final Stab' are good. What brings the movie down is the characters. Within the first 10 minutes of meeting this self-obsessed, apathetic group of characters, I found myself rooting for the killer. The premise of the film is basic and unoriginal. An obnoxious woman (I am being kind) puts together a mystery weekend for her just as obnoxious friends (primarily getting all of them there by extortion). She has hired an actor to play a masked killer for the evening, but alas, a real killer has invaded the evening and they all still think the deaths are just good acting. One of the funniest scenes has the Brittney Spears wannabe approached by the killer, whom she thinks is the actor, and remarks (paraphrased) "Is this going to be messy?". As the killer is stabbing her, her boyfriend is watching from a window and is seriously impressed by her 'good performance'. 'Final Stab' is not poorly made, just poorly conceived. It is difficult to like a film when there are no characters to like. This is too bad, since with some character development and a less disjointed story they could have had a good movie; the basic ingredients were there.--Bob
I have read a lot of reviews of this workout being monotonous but I find it very satisfying. High reps bring great results, no matter how boring they might be. Very athletic and easy to follow which I love. And Greg is pretty funny. It works your core as it says it will and the cardio is high impact but keeps your heart rate elevated. There are a few segments with the band I skip and do my own exercise because I find it a bit confusing, and don't really feel it the next day. But then he says "if you are not feeling it, you probably aren't doing it right" and this could definately be true. LOL
Fox is wasting money and time releasing Family Guy on DVD! The show should have ended during the writers strike. I hope many people realzie that Family Guy is really disgusting and violent. violent in animation is the last thing this world needs, because things are bad enough as it is. Please do not release anymore Family Guy DVDs!
The fourth edition of this book is a very useful & handy resource for fans of the show's original run (1963 to 1989 with the first seven Doctors and the 1996 movie with the eighth Doctor) as it provides all the essential information one needs to know of the episodes, including a brief plot summary; the names of a story's writer, director, producer, script editor, "regular" cast members, and "guest stars"; airdates; & whether or not a novel, script book, or videotape of the story has been released (no information is given as to DVD releases probably because the BBC is constantly cranking out new DVDs of hitherto "long lost" broadcasts - most of the original broadcast tapes of the first two Doctors' stories were "wiped" by the BBC for re-use, so the BBC Video department has had to obtain copies of these stories from overseas Doctor Who broadcasters and private collectors - in any event, if one wanted to know if a given story were on DVD, one only has to search for it here, at Amazon.com). Of course, there are a couple of other Doctor Who program guides on the market that go into the episodes in much greater detail, providing, for example, "behind-the-scenes" info, but if one were THAT interested in knowing everything about a given story, one need only check the BBC's own Doctor Who website to find what one is looking for (indeed, their website often quotes these very same guidebooks). For its simple, barebones purpose, THE DOCTOR WHO PROGRAMME GUIDE, FOURTH EDITION is more than adequate.
This specific brand of Vitamin C was recommended by my mercury-free biological dentist... to take before, during and after the mercury amalgam removal process. The same detox procedure would apply to root canal extraction, crown replacement and any form of dental work.Vitamin C is like fuel for the immune system. During any type of detox, cold, flu, depression, tiredness, etc. taking vitamin C will help.Each Lypo-Spheric packet contain 1,000 mg of Vitamin C. It is recommended that 1 or 2 packets are ingested daily. This vitamin C is unique because it is 98% bio-available - meaning that 980 mg of the 1,000 mg in this packet are used by the body.The content of each packet is a gel that is squeezed either into the mouth directly (how I take it) or mixed in water in a glass. The taste is a bit unpleasant, but nothing bad. But since it's not in your mouth for more than a few seconds, I don't really mind.Because the cost is roughly $1 per serving and the source is highly processed (I'm an organic whole food advocate) I only use these packets for the days before, of, and after my dental work. The mercury-free dental detox process recommends vitamin C daily for many months, since the detox is so long and slow. For the non-dental work days I useTruly Natural Vitamin C - 500 g - Powder. I'm following the guidance by the "founder" of mercury-free dentistry Hal Huggins which are in his two booksIt's All in Your Head: The Link Between Mercury Amalgams and IllnessandUninformed Consent : The Hidden Dangers in Dental Care. If you are having health problems of any kind I highly recommend reading these two books. It will open your eyes to the dangers of having the world's #2 most toxic substance in your body and how it binds to your immune system to keep it from functioning properly.Because I haven't had any colds, flus, etc in over 10 years (attributed to my fasting, organic diet and exercise) I can't say how effectively this vitamin C works. I just know that I'm following the protocol recommended by the best dental health experts in the world.
I hate that the figure has only five points of articulation: arms, legs, and neck. I hate that George Lucas replaced him in the Special Edition because he thought the mask looked fake. I love that there was a wolf-man in the Star Wars Cantina. I love that they made a figure of it.
When I went to take a beginner sewing class at my local fabric store, I had never sewn before and didn't have a clue what scissors to buy. I asked the ladies at the cutting counter which scissors they would recommend and the lady was using these and said that they were her favorite. I bought them and have been extremely happy with them ever since. They are fairly light weight and very comfortable to hold. I later bought a pair of Tonic brand scissorsTonic Studios 839 Kushgrip 8-1/2-Inch Left Hand General Purpose Scissorsbecause of their pretty color and cushy grip. They were terrible and wouldn't even cut through a double layer of knit fabric. I have cut many types of fabrics with these with no problem and many of those were double layered. So, if you're looking for a good pair of sewing scissors, you should really give these a try.
i was uneducated in lithium batteries. i thought they were rechargeable. but have come to get info from energizer via their telephone rep..that only lithium ion batteries are rechargeable...that lithium batteries as these are NOT.to me then, the price value is just not there. for the price paid for these i can buy around 36 good alkaline cells.update: i have found these batteries to not last as long as regular alkaline batteries....e.g. i get about 6 months use on a clock from an alkaline but only two months on these lithiums....obviously then i will stick with alkaline over these....i have tho moved to using rechargeable cells for nearly everything anymore- usually the enelop from sanyo- these are very good and certainly cost effective...
I am a fan of Dr. Amen's work for many reasons. He has really opened up the science of the mind in profound ways. He is a brain researcher who attended a Christian University. His findings about the human brain will change the way we look at things like mental health, behavioral problems and as this book illustrates, even the nature of the soul/brain relationship. I don't agree with Dr. Amen on all of his conclusions (like doing brain scans on our elected officials so we can see what sort of brain problems they might have), but I have learned quite a bit from his books about the nature of how our brain health affects every part of our lives. Highly Recommended!Is this review helpful? Please vote. :-)
Carry around in your purse or pocket, dispose of ashes and/or butts in a politically correct manner. Well made, no leaking.
I don't think that it is hyperbole to describe this book as awesome. I am not the first to sing its praises...I have just finished reading it for the third time, twice in English, once in French, and found it each time more rich and satisfying than the time before. The last reading was intering because the French have had an experience with Catholicism far different than ours, and it appears in the prose. It would be presumptous to give it the number one honors, because the list of 20th century authors in the competition is pretty stiff (Joyce, Faulkner, Kafka, Steinbeck, Grass...), but this book gives all of them a good running for their money. To read this as simply a dark ages murder mystery would be satisfying enough - there are plenty of passages describing odd and quirky, monastic life with enough colorful characters to make a satisfying read. But the book is oh, so much more. It is no accident that the setting is pre-renaissance Italy. The story plays like a tarot spread before us. Adso is the Fool, the library is the Tower, William of Baskerville is the Wizard. The story is that of the Hanged Man. What we have here is the first skirmish between faith and science, This battle is shortly to come to a head in the trial of Gallileo that would see the the Renaissance migrate to Northern Europe. Here is the church encrusted with tradition, threatened by a man of reason and insight. Baskerville is no heretic, but is seen as one...We fight these same battles today, of demagoguery and closed-mindedness. Like William Stryon in Sophie's Choice, the characters play out a simple a drama, but on closer inspection can be seen to represent so much more. Be it Naziism or the Inquisition, a tyrant is still a tyrant, but truth and spirit will prevail regardless. Read Eco's book as a murder mystery if you desire, but see it as Everyman retold, and come to see a gread deal more.
Ok clearly I was missing something. I gave up on page 101 because I just could not be bothered reading on. It is not like me to give up on such a short novel but this was grating on my every nerve.I hated the Southern American Negro vernacular that was used from the start. The grammatical errors of this speech just annoyed me. Ok,ok, I know that is probably how the characters talked in real life back then but I struggled to follow it. I also thought the writing style (other than the type of speech used) was rather self righteous and long winded. Even 101 pages in, the author had not really made a point, or at least not one that I noticed.If this is the "most important novel written about the American Negro" then I really need someone to sit down and explain why. Surely, To Kill a Mockingbird would be more important or Gone with the wind, or many other such novels. Luckily, this is a book group choice and I will, partially, get the chance to find out why when we sit down and discuss it.Sorry to all the diehard fans out there but I just did not get it.
I was appalled by how poor this movie was. I love both Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow and it's a shame that a movie with reasonable potential could be so bad. The characters are un-interesting and the plot is overly predictable to the point of annoying. This movie was a waste of a perfectly good 106 minutes of my evening.
I understand it takes years for a coffee tree to bear fruit. That said, this plant has done very nicely over the past few months. It outgrew its original container so I planted it in a larger one. It is thriving and the base has started to become bark, which I'm taking as a good sign. The soil I used was for succulents with some (~10-20%) added perlite. Maybe I'll come back in a few years and update, but by now I can tell the plant is viable and doing well. People ask me what it is and it's fun to tell them it's a coffee plant. :)
Totally silly book. The plot was non existant or not worth writing. The characters were just as silly and the book has the WORSE Satan ever. A simpering stupid and very very annoying character. NO real character development and all they do is whine about their respective lack of sex lives. 5/10
I couldn't put the book down, reading it at the edge of my seat, I've never been more disgusted and angry about a book, but not at the author at the perpetrators of these heinous crimes against children, DeCamp documents how their is laws for some and complete illegality for the elite, essential to understanding the New World Order and who runs the world.
This extremely creepy novel really got into my head. In all seriousness, if you are a nervous person or have just lost a loved one, I would skip this book. No joke.First, the writing. As all have said, it is outstanding. It is the best I have read in the genre, and I have read all the usual authors and titles. He obvously knew the setting and the characters well, and he could really create an atmosphere for the reader. Like all writers, he does cause you to reach for the dictionary occasionally, but the flow of his writing is very smooth and easy to read. He didn't waste words or the readers time. Some writers, with the best intentions no doubt, have a tendency to overdue the prose and actually harm their cause more than they help it. Someone like Peter Straub is certainly a superior writer, but at times he can numb you with his wordiness and cause your interest (and desire to continue) to wane. McDowell, on the other hand kept the story moving and it never went flat.Second, the story. This is the scariest book I have ever read. At times I seriously considered closing the book and putting it away, I was just too disturbed. The setting and the characters are authentic and convincing, and the plot was, and still is, quite unique.I stumbled across this book somewhere on the internet while searching for recommended horror novels. I kept finding the same novels listed time after time, many of which I have read and enjoyed, but this one was only mentioned once at some obscure website. I then researched it on Amazon and found that it had been very well received and decided to buy it. I had never heard of McDowell, yet his writing (this book anyhow) is superior to the others that are household names.If this book has a "weakness", it would be the ending. Although it is perfectly suspenseful and well-written, the intensity does not match the beginning and middle of the book. The beginning and middle are so good and so creepy, I am not sure how the ending could top it, and I am not sure if I could handle it if it did.Again, the best horror novel I have ever read. Highly recommended for those who can handle it.
I am a yogi and I know about vegetarianism/veganism. I am also aware of what is on my plate and how it got there -- which is something that more people need to think about. There is nothing new in this book but if its hip and trendy delivery gets the message out and introduces the idea that you should be aware of what you are eating for your health, your waistline and the benefit of the world -- then more power to them. The catchy title and hipness factor disguises the fact that this is actually a pretty serious book.Ethics and slaughterhouses do not go hand in hand. There are lots of books on it. It is worth reading about because most people are oblivious to the extreme cruelty and unsanitary conditions involved in getting that steak on their plate. If you spent 5 minutes in a slaughterhouse, you would never ever dream of eating any animal product again.Vegetarianism is more and more recognized as the way to eat to protect your health... again, there are plenty of books on that written by doctors if you choose to read them. The China Study is well recognized.You can make small changes in your daily routine-- buy vegan mayonaise (it's actually good and you wont know the difference) from the health food store instead of regular mayo. Drink/use nut milk or hemp milk instead of dairy milk. It's a matter of substituting.The authors cover not just how to lose weight, but also the problems with the FDA, the ineffective "laws" on humane treatment of farm animals, liberal use of hormones and pesticides in our food.... they are pointing out that your health is in your hands and on your plate.I do think that the authors' use of the English language is lacking and does nothing to add to their message. I am not uptight but saying things like coffee makes your breath smell like ass is just so NOT needed.
Each of the other commentators has a favorite one or two pieces on this album. I see this is a well balanced selection of mostly unfamiliar works that are all listenable at a minimum, and gorgeous in many regards. In other words, I think the adventurous listener will find some new pieces to love in this CD. It is good to have an American collection that does not contain just the usual war horses.
I feel I must respond to that last comment on Animal House. Granted, Belushi is the staple that hold this film, but there are many others that do so as well. It is not all Belushi; Matheson, Sutherland, Vernon, and Furst are all worthy to see in this film. It set standards for college obnoxiousness that were probably worse in real life. But National Lampoon did just that: it lampooned the reality. It was not as biting as the magazine, but neither were the Vacation films or any of the other rather bad films that they made within the past 10 years. Other than Animal House, Vacation, and Christmas Vacation, the others are terrible. The Blues Brothers a classic compared to Animal House? Incredible. You sit through that whole film to watch the car chases, especially the one at the end. In comparison Animal House is a laugh riot. If you want to be entertained and are looking for a good poke in the eye of college life, Animal House will fit the bill.
I can see this movie going down in film history as being one of the most chilling ghost stories made. This film is extremely intense although it is only pg-13. It is like this decades Poulterguiest or Exorcist. I highly recremend this if I could give it more then 5 stars I would.
This is perhaps one of the most boring, long winded and stiff books I have ever read. The description on the back made you think it was going to be a good thriller, but once I got started I had to force myself to finish, I bought, I'm reading it. Her writing style leaves a lot to be desired. All I can say is that this is my last book by this author.
I am a tremendous fan of Ms. Jakeman's Lord Ambrose Mysteries, which are as well plotted as they are well written. This novel, however, is very disturbing. Yes, I had to finish it - but I sincerely regret my curiosity. Ms. Jakeman is such a good writer that the scenes of horror are indelibly printed on my mind. And they are revolting. Was this necessary? I believe a writer with as much talent as she has could have captured her audience in another way. Buyer beware.
I found this book to be pretty useless.The meaninings described in the book are plain confusing because they are wrong. Someone who'd been studying tarot before would not find one single match between their card meanings and the card meanings there. I was wondering which deck did the author use to get inspiration for the card meanings. I have been reading Tarot for a while and I found zero useful information in this book, I believe it could confuse someone who just started studying tarot. As for more experienced tarot readers, it is completely useless, as they will not be able to add anything to their knowledge and experience.I also didn't find any other Tarot related information that could be of interestUpdate: Perhaps I should clarify a few things. What I meant by "not useful" is that the card meanings described in the book deviate significantly from traditional ones and also no specific deck is mentioned and it's not stated whether the author is talking about a traditional deck or not. So, in my opinion it is not possible to apply the knowledge from the book to a regular tarot deck and if one is looking for learning about traditional tarot meanings and wisdom, I would not recommend this particular book.It seems to me that author gave her own interpretations of tarot, without giving consideration to traditional meanings and that's why I found it so confusing. For example on 6 of cups, traditionally, there is a little girl and a little boy, but author called little boy a "dwarf". This book is not a guide to definite symbols of tarot but a glance at what the author saw in each card. It does not mean her opinion is not interesting, because it is, but I would not recommend this book as a guide to tarot.Unfortunatelly I cannot remember more specific exaples besides 6 of cups since it has been a while since I read the book and I sold my copy.
If you like Keb Mo at all, you'll love this DVD. A great selection of tunes from his first couple discs, but defnitely not carbon copies of the originals. If you get a chance to see him, do it, especially if it's just him and his guitar. Maybe not for blues purists, or those expecting screaming electric blues guitar, just great music.
When I think of early 70s pop culture, nothing embodies and virtually SCREAMS the early 70s for me as much as this show. During an era when variety shows ruled, this one has always been the king of them for me, and I've dreamt of owning episodes like this for 30 years now. This set does not disappoint and really delivers the goods.One of the very best things about it is that you get FULL and unreedited episodes, exactly the way they were broadcast, right down to those memorable animated sequences with the ball-creature at the commercial breaks. BRAVO to the people who brought us this DVD collection for giving us exactly what we wanted!Looking at this show again for the first time in 30 years, it seems even sillier and schmaltzier than I remembered. Younger folks raised only on Saturday Night Live might find it hard to appreciate, and it's significant that this show's initial run ended in 1974, just a year before the debut of SNL. I feel it symbolizes the end one of one era in comedy and the beginning of another. What we have here is humour in the old-school, high camp Vaudevillian tradition.Yes, some of the jokes are downright groan-worthy, and for anyone else this show might have flopped, but what makes it work here is the undeniable talent, charisma and charm of -- and chemistry between -- Sonny & Cher, who I consider one of the great couples of the 20th century. Sure the jokes are silly, but here are two people just literally having the time of their lives making this show, and their enthusiasm and enjoyment is infectious.The guest list on these shows is a star-studded who's-who of 70s pop culture including Burt Reynolds, Howard Cosell and even Ronald Reagan from the early 70s and Donny & Marie and Farah Fawcett-Majors from the later 70s. And I'll bet today's young'uns will have a hard time recognizing a very young Michael Jackson as he performs with his brothers the Jackson 5 and on his very first solo hit "Ben".Disc 1 gives us 3 episodes from the first season, while Disc 2 gives us 1 episode from the second and 2 episodes from the third season. Funnyman Ted Ziegler (what ever happened to him?), a young Terri Garr and Steve Martin (before his hair went grey and still sporting a hippie beard!), and Canada's own late great Billy Van (fresh from Hilarious House of Frightenstein) round out the gags.The best thing for me was seeing that great ol' cheesy weekly V-A-M-P sketch that I've carried fond memories of in my head all these years again. And in the third season Cher introduces her greatest character of all, Laverne the laundromat lady. (Can somebody please explain what a "yenta" is?)Disc 3 features 3 episodes from their short-lived reunion series from 1976-77 (after divorcing and each having separate variety shows of their own). The show gets off to a rough start due to the absence of producers Blye & Beard. The first episode is pretty terrible, but don't give up on this second series and keep right on going to the second and third shows on this disc. They get better. One has a priceless sketch with Cher and Don Knotts which shows Cher at her naughtiest, cheekiest best. All I can say is, this lady must be some~ fun for any man to be with!The 2003 commentary by Cher is brief, but we really gain some insight into what interests her, as we hear all about the costumes she wore, little tidbits about Sonny, and even why she seemed to lose her eyebrows for a while. Great stuff!The interview with the producers is also good, although they come off as a little smug. But hey, I guess if they could make a show which has stayed as close to my heart as this one has for the past 30 years, they deserve to be a little proud."But wait, that's not all..." I don't know what mouldy old vault they dug this out of, but an amazing bonus treasure for Sonny & Cher fans here is a 20-minute segment of them on the long-forgotten 1969 Barbara McNair Show. The picture is crystal clear and looks like it was just made today. It gives us a good idea of what their lounge act must have been like in the 60s, and the segment ends in a great medley with a cookin' version of "The Beat Goes On" featuring classic Question Mark & the Mysterians-type 60s organ in the background. Groovy~!You also get videos for Cher's 70s solo mega-hits like "Half-Breed" and "Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves", Sonny & Cher karaoke, and the extra audio CD that comes with this is just pure icing on the cake, baby. This set would easily have been worth the price even without it.This show was such a part of my life in the early 70s that looking at it again is like seeing old movies of long-lost relatives who used to come over each week for a visit with their little family. -- And then suddenly they were gone... never to reappear on my TV screen again... Until now!! I have to confess that seeing Sonny & Cher with Chastity at the end of their show again brought a little lump to my throat. I have REALLY, really missed you, guys...I really hope that the people who made this set will keep releasing the rest of the episodes of this fantastic series on DVD. I want them all!!! And I also hope to someday see on DVD both Sonny and Cher's solo series, as well as the 5 episodes of the summer replacement series they did before this show that they mention in the intro of the first episode on disc 1 here.To any Sonny & Cher fan, I say "Buy this set. You won't be disappointed!"
After learning that Ministry used to be a synth dance outfit it's hard to imagine how they completely changed their sound for this album (and it's predecessor Twitch). Lightining fast drum beats slam away over Rammstein-esque guitars that are absolutely unrelenting. Some of the songs contain vocals while others use samples. Of course there's Jesus Built My Hotrod which contain absolutely off the wall vocals from Gibby Haynes of the Butthole Surfers.One of the things on the album that appeals to me so much is the sense of humor that runs through it. Al Jourgensen never takes himself on the album which is evident in the above mentioned track, Psalm 69 which features samples of a something that sounds like an choir in the church of Satan, people yelling "praise Jesus" and a priest speaking before turning into a mind numbing speed metal groove.This album really insn't for everyone and definately not something you can play just anytime. But if you'd like some ... kicking industrial with a twisted sense of humor, then you'll love this.
I bought this set on the strength of several glowing reviews on Amazon (British and American). ClassicsToday and Gramophone, although I already have the complete cycle several times over: by various conductors and orchestras (Haitink, Boulez, Chailly, Solti, Sieghart, Zander, Barshai, Kubelik, Levi, Levine, Rattle, Haenchen & Neumann) and the box sets by Edo de Waart on RCA/Cobra (good, but now out of print; if it's available it's rediculously over priced), Bernstein on DGG (no further blurb needed), Emil Tabakov on Cappricio (steer well clear of this one, it's dreadful really), Inbal on Brilliant (very good in some symphonies, listless in others) and Michael Gielen on H&auml;nssler (outstanding modernist view, a bit like Boulez, but less deliberate).I relish this particular set because of the wonderfully warm sound quality (listen to those very deep basses in the "Alles Verg&auml;ngliche" chorus at the end of the 8th symphony), the non-prima donna singing of most vocal soloists, the generally faster pacing (as opposed to some of Haitink's snail like tempos; except in the ninth, where Bertini's finale is very much slower than most, but to great effect), the careful attention to detail and the generally unsentimental interpretation. The booklet comes with complete texts and full details about recording dates and locations.One (very) minor point of criticism is that in order to cram all the music onto just eleven CDs, the various symphonies are sometimes strangely distributed over two discs and the chronology is interrupted. But musically a very worth while asset.If you're looking for a complete Mahler set, this one should certainly deserve your consideration (with Gielen's a serious competitor; better: get them both).
I loved Star Wars for the bigger part of my life. Not mentioning the unnecessary changes, which are awful, I have seen the quality of these Blu-ray disks. It's abysmal! On top of all that, in an unheard of case of false advertising, Lucasfilm claimed they fixed the glaring errors of the DVD edition, and they did so for A FEW shots, they used to promote the set, and left the rest of the movies as they were in the awful 2004.DVD transfer. Maybe a loss of 30% of detail due to black crush is unimportant to many people. Maybe pink lightsabers do not trouble majority. Some people will not object blue snow and almost black faces of characters on Hoth. Perhaps audio problems can't be perceived by everyone. But this is a problem for me, and I am not paying this time!
To everyone who has never seen dragon ball-z, don't buy this episode. Dragon ball-z after the saiyen saga relly starts to ..... Akira Tori...creator of Dragon Ball got bored after The Saiyen saga in Dragon ball z. However, he was forced to continue into the frieza saga which is what this dvd leads up to. Don't buy it, the voices for Goku, and all the other characters start to .... as they are changed, also these episodes just do not have the humor of Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z. The editing by Funimation and Pioneer takes all the fun out of the series. I would strongly recommend not buying this episode, don't waste 12 dollars on this stupid episode. No dis-respect to .......... intended. I recommend buying earlier episodes in the Dragon Ball collection or the ones late in the series involving Cell and the Androids. They are much better, however if you are an older viewer you would probably enjoy the unedited versions if you can get them. They are not available for earlier episodes.
I learned so much about acne from reading this book. Dr. Fulton is a former acne sufferer himself, which gives him credibility (in my opinion). He is extremely empathetic to what the acne sufferer is experiencing physically and psychologically. Often when I read informational books, I find myself skimming, but I read each and every word of this book. It was extremely well written and easy to understand. His treatment program seems to be based in science, not feelings or hunches, and I like that. We plan on giving the program a try. Excellent book on acne!
If you dont have this game, youre not a true corvette fan. Some people say this game isn't that great, but THEY ARE WRONG. This game is one of the best racing games in the world. And for $10, seriously thats a deal. It has sooooo many options like career mode, arcade mode, and some other special modes, that you have to unlock. Whats really cool about it, is that you dont get all of the cars in the beginning, you have to unlock them, that makes the game even more challenging. All in all this game is a &quot;you must get&quot;.Imports suckand blow up all Kias
This book does not deserve the bad reviews it recieved from other readers who have posted here. It is very well thought out (and it is obvious the amount of research that went into it). At the end of the book, I was wishing there was a sequel, because I was curious about what would happen next.What kind of government would be set up? What would happen to the narrator, what happened to the two boats that went out in search of the rest of the world?It is very intriguing.This book is a good book- in its catagory. You won't like it if you expect it to be an adventure novel, or... whatever. It is what it is- the story of a bunch of people trying to rebuild a society. Their story is not glamourous, or rife with dangerous situations. It doesn't dissolve into a gory, bloody mess.If you read it for what it is, and not what you think it might be, you will probably like it.
SIMPLE - great hat, keeps me cool, wear it outdoors all the time and people approach me asking where they can get one.
No one describes a creature like Alan Dean Foster! Hands down, the very best. His silverslith sent shivers down my arms. I've read it many times, and I even use it to teach my students how to write a descriptive paragraph. His mind knows no bounds when inventing animals, plants, and humans. Probably my favorite fantasy book of all times (though Mid-Flinx) comes in a close second.
This book is geared toward parent's with children in the toddler years, so it really ranges for 18 months through 3 years. It really was a helpful book to help me understand my toddlers better and then react to them out of that understanding. Really makes it less infuriating when you understand why they are having a melt down over a green cup, believe me! We did not/have not implemented all of Rosemond's ideas and to be honest I don't plan to. The toddlers are not exactly terrific, but really much more tolerable in our home after reading this book. Even if you read this book and implement nothing, the understanding for your child that you have gained will help you deal with your little terror... I mean, toddler. It is a quick read, which us parents of toddlers need!
I've listened to this tape 3 times.Peter Coyote is a brilliant narrator.I've listened to his reading of Zen Mind,Beginner's Mind 30+ times, and I learn somethingnew every time.However, this collection of stories/parables/fablesis quite the opposite of that awakening book.In my opinion, this book discourages questions, andpromotes power figures. I have to express that mostof these stories left me a bit angered at the methodThe Enlightened One reprimands those curious to learnthe true method of living a whole life. Most storiesend on a tone of 'silly questioner, you will never understand'.What an awful way to build up a person's beautiful, courageousexplorations into understanding the flow of existence.I would ask anyone interested in this book to get'Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind', and learn from both.If you're like me, you'll find that the methods of instructionis the true food for building wisdom.My personal belief is that 'Zen Flesh, Zen Bones' is abook that doesn't allow a person to grow on their own,but keeps an unaware person continually emotionally dependenton those who profess they have the answer.
"Flightplan" is one of those you-must-suspend-all-the-critical-belief-you've-ever-used-to-function-as-a-sapient-human-being, contemporary Hollywood thrillers. It is easy, of course, to be smug and caustic about such presentations, which as I've argued elsewhere are part of the burgeoning Dumbing-Down-of-America movement which is especially prevalent nowadays in the motion picture field. This particular example also further advances its mediocrity by stealing from (of course the writers like to claim it is "in homage to") several other movies of the genre from time past, such as "The Lady Vanishes" and "Bunny Lake is Missing", both of which managed to entertain without resorting to a nearly complete logical breakdown of plot.Acting-wise, we get in "Flightplan" what has become today pretty much a standard Jodie Foster vehicle. She turns in a competent performance certainly, though at times she can become a tad whinny. If her acting is also forced to veer crazily between near psychic incapability brought on by a sudden severe tragedy, and a brilliantly competent display of expertise in both the fields of criminology and aviation technology, it is of course the fault of the incredible script that she must twist herself into such a schizophrenic display. The usually underrated Sean Bean -who would have made a much more suitable Aragorn than Viggo Mortensen in "Lord of the Rings", had that movie's director been more faithful to the original source - gives a stolid performance which is forced to turn into almost complete concrete by the end when he becomes the simple-minded pawn of the chief villain. As for Peter Sarsgaard, one can only wonder at the praise that has been thrown at his near-drugged, snake-eyed performance by many reviewers here or elsewhere. One simple question should suffice for these people: Is this really how you would want a real-life air marshal to look and act if your safety was ever in his hands 40,000 feet above terra firma? All-in-all, such a gun toting protector who has apparently sniffed just a bit too much airplane glue should hardly give one the strongest post 9/11 confidence in our country's aviational war on terror.Again, one can complain ad nauseam about the plot holes in a movie that, alas, also includes long introspective scenes allowing one to not only see the holes easily, but to literally fall in and swim around in their glaring irrationality. But what disturbs most is not simply that the writers - and by extension, the director, the producer (Mr. Glazer, whose appearance fits all to easily into the adolescent-brained image the movie conveys), and also sadly the audience who are thought to be so capable of so suspending their intellectual capacities that one wonders if these capacities aren't lost to them beyond recovering once outside the confines of the multiplex's front door, could with just a little semblance of labor either asphalted over or even completely avoided at least some of the script's pitfalls in the first place. Foster's character is called a propulsion engineer, for example, when absolutely nothing in the movie involves the slightest knowledge of the workings of the airliner's engines. Since a knowledge so thorough it even survived her highly distressed psychic situation of avionics and cabin design was what was needed for her character, how difficult would it have been to simply label her as one of the plane's aeronautical designers, a catchall phrase that might have kept the more conscious members of the audience from bursting out into incredulous guffaws a good half a dozen times during the movie? And why was she allowed to load onto the airplane first and alone with her daughter, thus straining believability to the extreme that no member of the crew ever saw her come in the door or move down the aisle or take her seat - couldn't she simply have been shown boarding in a crush of other passengers who are all too preoccupied with getting settled in to be individually noticeable? Since none of the eventually revealed villains had the ability to tamper with the plane's passenger list, thus removing her daughter's reservation as the script said they had done, couldn't her necessary presence on the list have been explained away as due to her having simply bought a ticket for her daughter in her neurotic fantasy that she was still alive? And couldn't it have been shown at some time that her going to sleep - so necessary to the plot's success - was induced by a drug put into a drink by someone? Couldn't, in other words, the writers have spent at least a brief amount of their well-paid time coming up with at least a few plausible steps in the plot that would have rendered it somewhat less incredible and dependent on a train of events so lengthy and beyond the perpetrators' control that they had about as much chance of pulling their caper off as a monkey has of writing Shakespeare? There was a time, perhaps not even as far back as "Bunny Lake", when that was what writers believed they were supposed to do, fully in keeping with the integrity of their profession. Sadly, not only is a script like "Flightplan" an indication of the current worth in which they hold their profession, but even more an example of the contempt in which they - and the others involved in such an insult to rational entertainment - hold us, the paying audience. And just maybe, tragic to say, from all the positive reviews and the large attendance this movie has gotten, they are right.
Look, I know alot of people were mad about the last "Rock Against Bush" (Vol.1) album showcasing the band New Found Glory. I recently confirmed that certain members of that band ARE NOT left-wing, at all. In fact, one member even claims to support Bush and his actions to invade Iraq. So Admittedly, it was hypocritical for their song to appear on that comp. But this time around, the right-wing music fans have nothing to complain about. None of their favorite bands are "switchin up", and unlike last time, its very clear where ALL 28 of these bands have stood politically. Bottom Line, If you don't like the message, then you don't have buy the album...Now, on to "Rock Against Bush" (vol. 2). Like I said, ALL the bands on here this time around are very Liberal, and very set on removing bush. The music is good, but honestly, the DVD is worth the price alone. I would highly recommend this to any punk-rock fan, simply because this album is what Punk is all about. GET IT TODAY...
Before you read the review, take a moment to laugh at the idiot that said Boyz N Da Hood is the best southern rap group. Forget Bun B & Pimp C, three 6 mafia members are the real underground kings. With a track record like theirs, it's hard to slip up. Mafia members are known for their underground, murder music that are driven by dark beats. But, the saddest moment of my life came when I heard the new album. Mainstream, Lil Jon-type, generic "crunk" beats fuel the album. You won't be able to tell the difference between beats. With appearances by mtv style rappers Paul Wall and Slim Thug (both off of the mediocre Swisher House label), three 6 mafia seems to have fallen off. I hate to say it as much as you, but if you know ANYTHING about three 6 mafia, you will be disappointed by the new album. Let's not be confused, I will still listen to the new album, but let's get back to the 1998 flow. three 6 mafia will remain number one as my cult favorite group. Paul, Juicy, what happened? Please, release some more dark, murda type stuff.
"Black Swan = intense"Those were the words used by my cousin on her fb status to describe the movie right after watching it on the theater and I think is the best description anyone can give it.Stripped down "Black Swan" is pretty simple, a ballerina trying perfect her art. Most of the film is exclusively Portman's viewpoint. We get to see how unstable she is but I rarely got to understand what she was actually feeling. For the life of me I have no idea if she loved the mom or hated her same with the instructor or if she even considered Mila a friend. Maybe I'm not Avant-garde enough to get all the intricacies of the character or maybe there isn't much more to gather...In any case where Black Swan triumphantly succeeds is in its execution. Aronofsky elegantly follows Portman's every step like a shadow of her darker self waiting for the right moment to come out. His camera movements are truly a stroke of genius. Even on the dancing numbers there is so much fluidity, its such a treat to see not only the characters waltz through with the music but the cameras too.As the movie progresses the tension increases too until it reaches boiling points. As the events continued I kept going omg omg something big is going to happen [spoiler] the mom is going to end up killing her, she is going to end up being Beth's alter ego, , I think I saw a monster on the trailer oh man when is it going to appear but like that Family Guy spoof section of Jedi where everyone signals each other for 5 minutes before executing the plan to rescue Luke. The build up was bigger than the execution. Not that the final act wasn't cool because I did like it but the build up was unnecessarily inflated.[/spoiler]All in all a well done film. Kinda like Kill Bill where you take a simple story but elevate it to awesomeness by making it artistically beautiful and engaging. But Kill Bill was better ;)
This would be a five star review if the thing kept working. I loved it and found all the features useful and effective.Alas, it was not to be. The first one failed, and the dealer would not help me, so I sent it back to BD. They sent me a refurb which was intermittent, so back it went. 2 months later, I got another refurb from them. So far, so good. Maybe the third time will be the charm.UPDATE: A year and a half later.....The third time is not the charm. The fan is super noisy and grindy, and it takes several tries to get the charger to charge.
Unlike the previous reviewer, I am not in the least bothered by the sound quality of this release. In fact, the sound is really quite good on most tracks. Sound quality is a moot point, however, because the playing is extremely inventive and swings like crazy! Even without the fabled Lester Young session, this would be a &quot;must have&quot; for the BG/CC tracks, but the Lester/Basie/Goodman/Christian session is sublime.Don't let the &quot;radio broadcast&quot; association put you off, this is some of Charlie's finest playing. And Benny's. Cootie Williams shines too.
Local histories are becoming more prevalent over the past several years, and this history covers the area south of Houston and its struggle to maintain autnomony over its massive neighbor to the north. It covers those that created the city of Pasadena, and their legacy. You get to experience cattle roundups, the railroad being built through town, the first vehicle to rumble through town, their first contact with airplanes, the Texas oil boom, and the crops that made the town famous. A few tragedies are mentioned....for some reason, most local historians don't mention a town's hardships, focusing instead on the good things that have occurred. However, it is only through tragedy that good cities and towns really come together and experience their finest hour. Overall, it is a very good work. Those interested in the area surrounding Houston to the south would enjoy the book.
I use it for IPSC. Excellent, you can talk without being disturbed by people shooting near you. They are also very light.Highly recommended.
The power of this mixer is great, but not worth the money if you want to use it a lot! We bake a lot of bread, gingerbread, etc., and I have gone through two of these in three years. (The company replaced it once when it went out after just one year.) The gears strip. We have never exceeded manufacturer's recommendations for amounts of flour. I started looking on the internet, and found that my experience is not uncommon for those who use the mixer a lot for bread, etc. I am looking at a Cuisinart to replace my KitchenAid, and I have used KitchenAid for thirty years! I am sad, but the quality seems to have changed, and I don't want to waste any more money.
The true story of BAT 21, finally giving credit where it was due. The first book and the movie missed the mark very badly. Worth the read.
This is the album, for the people that don't understand rap and say this is stupid. They have been smoking more than Snoop Dogg. This is a very good album. Snoop at his Best to me at least.
:: Stash White Christmas White Tea ::Having read that white tea is even more healthful than green, more antioxidants, and also that its flavor tends towards the light and mellow, which would be good for my ice tea mixes ... I went on a hunt in AMZN's aisle for white teas. This type seemed to be generally a bump up in price compared to the general pop, like mostlly in the $18+ range. Then found this Stash blend at only $13, so for the savings, I figured that I could overlook the part about Christmas on the packaging.I was also happy about the choice of blend on this. White tea, ginger root, peppermint. Ginger is absolutely my favorite flavor for ice tea already. And a little peppermint in there sounded good, too. Now that I have it, comment on the taste of the blend. The ginger in there is only very subtle. Which is fine, as I can add extra ginger tea bags to my ice tea batches -- and probably better as is for drinking just a cup of hot, straight tea. The peppermint is distinctive. Overall, the taste of the blend is quite crisp and light, with an easy-going flavorful tinge from the peppermint and ginger.When I tried this tea, I was instantly pleased, and made a note to buy Stash brand again. (AMZN is running a promo on the brand this month, so that works well...)I am glad to have discovered Stash, and am eager to try a few more varieties. My previous experience in brands of teas what limited by what has been available at my grocery stores. Lipton, Celestial Seasonings, Yogi, Triple Leaf. Recently via AMZN shopping I've bought and tried three brands new to me.o Bentley's. High quality green tea.o Stash. White tea blend - very nice!o Clipper. Blend of white tea + ginger. Tastes dry and messy and old.Glad that Clipper wasn't my only intro to white tea, since it was such a loser. The Stash got here the same week, and it, in contrast, was a very satisfying acquisition. I'm hoping for equally good results when this month I try out Stash in another variety, like probably a Green + ginseng. Or possibly a black, or even one of the chais ...
For $21 I am hard pressed to find a better stethoscope. I am using it in a veterinary setting and find the large head to work fine on cats and dogs alike. I am not hearing great lung sounds, but can hear obvious murmurs, etc. Not as clear as some higher ends, sure, but a GREAT spare or primary for a non-doctor. I may find that I am just rusty about placement on getting the best sounds anyway... With some time I may actually find that I like it more than I thought!
I got this because I thought it would be a good comedy for a cheap price. I couldn't even watch two episodes, it wasn't really funny, it seemed like it was trying to hard to be a family comedy but fell flat. There is a reason you missed this on TV because it just isn't that good.Watch Everybody Loves Raymond or The Cosby Show if you want to be entertained.
There are numerous compilations out on the market full of Andrew Lloyd Webber's music. As most people know, Lloyd Webber is the most successful musical composer of all time and many of his songs became standards not only in the theatre history, but also as tops on the charts. Even though he's British, his influence on the shape of the modern musical theatre expanded over the West End boundaries long ago and has thus made an enormous impact on Broadway. Two of his shows ("Cats" and "The phantom of the opera") hold the record as two the longest running shows in the history of Broadway. He has also been the only composer to have three of his shows running at Broadway concurrently. This compilation captures some of the best songs he has ever written, he personally supervised it and it is the best thing to have if you can't afford his five-CD compilation called "Now and forever", which was selected and supervised by him as well. You should bear in mind, however, that there are two compilations called Gold out there: The one made for the European and the British market, and this one, made for the American buyers. Some of the songs on both of them are the same, the others are performed by different artists and some can be found only in one of the two. This one here was issued later and it is digitally remastered. Therefore you should check your favourites and buy accordingly, or, if you can, buy them both, since both of them contain interesting songs and performers.So here are my thoughts about the tracks in this one:1. "Superstar" and "I don't know how to love him" are both from the concept album of "Jesus Christ Superstar". They sound wonderful as ever, although the orchestrations may seem a bit dated by now.2. "Sunset Boulevard" is marked here with two songs. Barbra Streisand's powerful voice shines all the way through in "As if we never said goodbye"; it's a shame she never played Norma Desmond on Broadway, since Patti LuPone wasn't allowed to take her Norma to New York, and Glenn Close butchered the role. Her limited vocal abilities were hardly suited for the material, as it is shown by the second Sunset song, "The perfect year", performed by Close and Alan Campbell. They both lack a decent singing voice, so this is the one song I skip regularly. The song itself sounds much better in its single version with pops orchestration, as can be heard on the European version of this compilation, where it is performed by Dina Carroll. This version here can hardly be considered a gold one.3. "The Phantom of the Opera" is represented by three songs. Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman performance in the song of the same title is amazing. They were both born to play their roles in this show and their voices fit together perfectly. Sarah can hit the high notes in the end like no other Christine. Cliff Richard and Sarah sing the lovely ballad "All I ask of you" with passion, and Cliff has a wonderful warmth in his voice. Finally, Michael Crawford gives his unique and mesmerising interpretation in "The music of the night".4. The 1996 movie version of "Evita" is Madonna's best role to date and it brought an Academy Award for Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice, who wrote "You must love me" especially for the big screen. This is another wonderful ballad with the haunting cello and piano solo. It just proves that Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice were the best collaborators. They really should do another musical together.5. "The Joseph and his amazing Technicolor dreamcoat" was Webber's first musical and the signature song "Any dream will do" is performed here by Donny Osmond, who also appeared in the video version. I find his rendition even better than London's Jason Donovan, since Donny isn't strictly bound by the notes and so sings it more casually. A wonderful pop piece.6."Memory" from "Cats" is probably the most famous of all Webber's songs, recorded by numerous artists. This version is sung by Betty Buckley, who was Broadway's Grizabella. Although Betty's performance can't be considered bad, I prefer Elaine Paige, who sung the song first, in the London production. Elaine has a note of sorrow in her at times husky voice, which I found very intriguing. Her performance can be considered definite, as heard on "Cats" DVD or in her latest two-disc compilation, "Centre stage: The very best of Elaine Paige", issued in May 2004. Still, those who prefer Ms. Buckley or who saw her on stage in this role won't be disappointed.7. "Pie Jesu" is the best known song from Webber's "Requiem", written in 1985 to commemorate the death of his father. I'm not too keen on the version included here, performed by Charlotte Church, because her voice isn't as pretty as Sarah Brightman's on the original recording and the tempo is somewhat faster here.8. "Don't cry for me Argentina" is among my all-time Lloyd Webber's favourites. I like all the ladies who performed "Evita" on the stage and on the screen (Julie Covington, Elaine Paige, Patti LuPone and Madonna), but on this disc is the version I am most satisfied with, since it is sung by Patti LuPone. Ms. LuPone has a very powerful voice with an amazing range and she deserved her Tony Award for this role. She was able to sound both vulnerable and decisive while singing this, whereas the other leading ladies emphasized one or the other in their interpretation. Mandy Patinkin's "Oh what a circus" is not the best, the orchestration is a little bit weak and his voice sounds thin to me. David Essex on the London cast recording is more suitable.9. "Aspects of love" boast here with its top song, "Love changes everything", performed wonderfully by Michael Ball. It was his #1 hit and is probably one of the most beautiful love anthems ever written.10. Three songs come from "Whistle down the wind". The studio release of the same title is one of the reasons I bought this compilation, although I already have the European one. It is performed by Sarah Brightman with Lloyd Webber playing the piano and a symphonic orchestra who nicely takes the lead of the main melody. Sarah voice is angelic; she sings it like a little bird. Very charming. Boyzone's "No matter what" was a huge pop hit in the charts. Again, we have a song with the suitable orchestrations and vocals. And lastly, Tom Jones' deep voice in combination with the back vocals of "The Sounds of Blackness" gives a rocking rendition of the church hymn "The vaults of heaven". It can't be found on the European version and Tom's voice shows it hasn't aged. Way to go.11. For the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, Webber wrote, together with his long-time lyricist Don Black, this last song, "Amigos para siempre or Friends for life". It's a nice duet between Sarah Brightman and Jose Carreras, their voices sore when bound together. The melody itself is neat, especially when the orchestra takes the lead.Besides the fact that some of the performers here were not the best for my taste, there is also the fact that some of Lloyd Webber's shows are omitted in this version, most notably, "Tell me on a Sunday". Also, unlike its European counterpart, this compilation isn't aligned chronologically, so we have 1970 Superstar being the first song, 1993 Sunset Blvd comes the second, followed by The Phantom from 1986 and so on. None the less, this CD is excellent as an introduction to Lloyd Webber's music and one can continue with his cast recordings from there. It's also very handy as a single disc compilation for the American fans.
Many years ago I got this album because I knew I had liked the Folk Implosion songs I had heard on the KIDS Soundtrack. This is nothing like those, but I liked it nearly as much. It's a totally different sound than what they would eventually make. This is the type of music you wish that you and your friends could sit around making at your apartment for fun. It's very lo-fi and that just makes it feel more like you were there recording it with them, laughing at all the silly ideas and lyrics they came up with. The only downfall is that it's a bit too short. I would think that anybody who has sat around and jammed with friends would enjoy this album.
I tried to watch this film a few years ago and was bored to tears so I quit about half way through. I ended up reading the book instead and really liked it. So I decided to revisit the movie and watched the whole thing. I'm afraid my initial impression was correct- it is really boring, and also frustrating to watch. It took the interesting straightforward narrative of the book and made it very confusing when it didn't have to be- a few simple scenes of clarification would have done wonders for the plot. If I hadn't read the book, I would have been lost. I also thought the sex and nudity which were not in the book were gratuitous and distracting. The book wisely made the alien nonsexual, but the movie had him sexually involved with Candy Clarke's character. The scene were he finally strips nude sans nipples, fingernails, contacts and apparently his penis and tries to have alien sex- whatever that is, the movie implied some kind of full body splooge fest- was pretty ridiculous. As was the scene where he rekindles his relationship with her, apparently with his fully functional prosthetic penis back in place. Bowie's acting was fine, he was after all, born to play an alien- but Candy Clarke and Rip Torn were both terrible, and their characters were both grating and unsympathetic. The make up to age them was also really bad. Buck Henry was probably the most interesting supporting character, but the scene where he and his partner were thrown from a window was also ridiculous and made no sense in the plot of the film.Any reviewer that gives this film a high rating I question their planet of origin. If you're from the planet earth, my prediction is you'll also dislike this film. Read the book instead.
This book was reviewed in the local paper and the review made is sound like an interesting tour thru academia. Some of it was; but, all in all, the politically correctness of the characters was exaggerated to the extreme. I am sure that somewhat similar people exist here and there, but to put them all together makes for pure fantasy.Hynes character description is detailed and very humorous. Without this I would not give even a two star rating. Also his &quot;one liners&quot; bring on a chuckle.The ending borders on the ridiculous. Perhaps it had a deeper meaning than I was able to fathom, but male and female bodies interchanging, spirits (or someone) jumping off a parapet. academics having a free for all shootout on a lonely campus, towers collapsing in a conflagration, etc., etc. How much liberty can an author take with fiction. I am sorry I wasted my time reading this.
I bought this for my brother because he hit two deer in one month. He has been using it for about a year and hasn't hit another one. He has seen a few on the side of the road, and some running away. Could be they normal course of events, or the result of the Warning System. All that matter is that he hasn't hit another deer!! Totally worth it to us.
Read Amazon.com's editorial review of this movie for a good overview of its setting. I can only add that the movie is a look at how good intentions can backfire, in this case that of the European view of progress mixing with African tradition like oil with water.The outcome is tragic, yet the principal characters have nothing but fine motives for what they are about. Culture and other impersonal forces have the final say, and one is left to wonder if progress, or may I say &quot;progress,&quot; should be forced on a reluctant people.Director Bruce Beresford has been rather unfairly criticized for lop-sided portrayals of virtuous native cultures versus corruptive western civilization, but as with his superb &quot;Black Robe&quot; movie &quot;Mister Johnson&quot; shows some of the less flattering sides of primitive societies. Indeed, &quot;Black Robe&quot; set off a minor spate of protest for its unblinkingly frank portrayal of Indian tribes in North America several centuries ago.Ultimately it's probably safe to say that &quot;Mister Johnson&quot; gives a fairly sympathetic showing of the Africans suddenly entangled in the road project headed up by Pierce Brosnan's character, but does so without truckling. This movie also shows that Brosnan has a broader range than just playing Bond, James Bond.
This riveting and inspiring tale will fill your heart and make your spirit soar. (No apology for the cliches.) I don't know if LIFE OF PI will make one believe in God, but it shows a way to hope for humanity. You know the old question, if you could meet anyone who ever existed, who would it be? I have my answer: Pi Patel. What an extraordinary man. Such strength, spirit and love. This magical book is one of the few I plan to read every few years; I expect to find new depths of wisdom and joy with every reading.The ending is pinpoint perfect.My words are inadequate. Just read it!
I'm a writer. I've heard Jennifer Egan speak, and I know her background and history. You guys are as far off-base as you could possibly be.Pay no attention to the negative reviews. How seriously can you take, for example, someone who can't distinguish between an author's own politics and those of the characters about whom she writes? And yes, she has academic training -- but her fiction was shaped by her experience as a struggling young writer in New York. And finally, the dozen-and-a-half reviews excerpted in the edition I have include raves from the NYTBR, Time, The Phila Inquirer, The SF Chrnoicle, etc -- who are you going to believe? NYTBR or some anonymous bozo on Amazon?Buy it -- you will absolutely not regret it.
This film may not be technically better than other Stanze films, however it does have the strength of innocence and effort. You can tell that they tried hard for this film, even Stanze.The plot is a decent, though underwritten one. It has the strength of originality, in the concept, not necessarily the story. The gore is decently done for a no-budget film. Makeup was terrible. Actors gave it their all, even if it wasn't enough.Since this is a directors debut, errors are forgivable.
With the vast output of the Bee Gees there will always be some tracks which get missed and are unjustifiably not better known. 'Rings' is one of these; a beautiful ballad sung in a typical folorn manner by Robin. If there's a pop voice which captures loss and melancholia better than Robin Gibb I'd be extremely surprised, and what is more his voice sounds just as good now as it did twenty and thirty years ago. 'Rings is a fabulous song which has never been officially released other than on this CD single, and this alone is reason enough to get this CD.
It was advertised as easy to install, and usable right out the box, but after plugging everything in and not being able to connect to the internet using my laptop, the ease kind of just flew out the window. I spent almost 3 hours on the phone with people from India who I could barely understand, and who clearly didn't care whether my product worked or not. To make a long story short, I finally got the router to work, and it's been working fine for the past month or so (knock on wood).So, the router is great and works fine. Hopefully you know how to set up your router by yourself because if you don't then you'll probably have to deal with some really unfriendly people.
When I think about Lisbon the images of Alfama, the electric tram, the Tagus river, its food, its people, and Fernando Pessoa come to my mind, but I have never considered that Lisbon could be experienced through its sounds, and I'm not talking about the sound of fado, that's a theme for another Lisbon Story. Wim Wenders pays special attention to the importance of sound, and music, when making a film. He shoot this film in the true Lisbon, in the heart of the city, not the Lisbon that you see in postcards, and he has managed to capture my beloved Lisbon as it really is, beautiful, old, dilapidated, surrealist, full of character.I love the music of Madredeus, although is not traditional fado, and despite the fact that I'm not a Teresa Salgueiro's fan, I have to say that the music -Salgueiro's high-pitched voice, and presence, included- gives an ethereal atmosphere to the film. No one but Madredeus could have been more adequate to make the music of Lisbon Story.I'd have loved to give 10 stars to this film. I loved it, it's magic, pure visual poetry. A fantastic trip to an amazing place that it will stay with me for a long, long time."In broad daylight, even the sounds shine" Fernando Pessoa
Looks like it was filmed with a digital cam-corder at a high budget Halloween haunted house. The courpes and skeletons looked like something you would see in a graveyard prop display at Spooks Halloween Store. The Zombies were not of George Romero's standard but were still very good. There a lot of black scorpions?????? Didn't understand their purpose. Lots of gore. And for a nice touch some VERY NICE female nudity. I always like that. It is a keeper.
Cute but the instructions are far from complete.I've tried the ducks and lamb and have been frustrated by both.For example the duck is made by two rectangles one for body and one for head. Instructions for head merely says to sew it up and make it round as possible. How??Then make the beak with over lapping buttonhole stitch. Huh? I know how to do buttonhole stitch on cloth but how to do it from yarn - no clue anywhere.How do you sew up the lamb's head to be shaped like a lambs head? No mention at all of the head in the sew up instructions.There are cute pictures, but for this price someone should have tested the patterns.
"Situation Out of Control", "Lucky Day", "When Parliament Convenes", the haunting (for a sometime sailor) "The Black Atlantic", the kicking "I Want to Rock" the cover of "Season of the Witch", "Saw You at the Hop", what's not to like? How many albums are you going to find where EVERY song is outstanding? Barbara Keith had an eponymous vinyl LP in 1972 that I tracked down and purchased on CD (well worth the effort) learning in that search about her subsequent band, 'The Stone Coyotes'. All (so far) seven Coyotes' albums are terrific, with, in my opinion, "fire it up" and "Situation Out of Control" being the stand-outs. "Barbara Keith" was folk with considered lyrics. Barbara Keith brings every bit of that intelligent poetic sensibility to hard-core rock and roll with 'The Stone Coyotes'. Just the first song alone, "Situation Out of Control", is worth the effort to acquire.
I am listening to different types of music, because I upgraded my stereo system. Once I could really hear the vocals and instruments, I realized I didn't want to listen to poor quality pop on my iPod. I knew I like some jazz, but didn't realize there were so many genres of jazz. What a learning process.Bottom line: I like a more frenetic energy in my jazz, and neo-bop delivers that perfectly. Of the well known neo-bop artists, I like Wynton Marsalis the most, even more than Branford, and every track on this album rocks.
MISTER HITCHCOCK...............YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE.SO DUMB, ITS NOT EVEN ENTERTAINING.
This is the sequel to the popular "Official Marvel Comics Try-out Book" of the mid- '80's. That book was the first place that writers, pencilers, inkers, letterers, and colorists could all find raw material to practice on so they would have something they could submit in the hope of getting a job at Marvel Comics. The original book was actually published as a contest and it started the career of Mark Bagley (he says so in the introduction to this book). The book would describe the job that a penciller, inker, letterer, etc. would have to do, what tools they could use, and then give pages ready for that person to work on (pages without color, pages without letters, pages without ink, etc.) The reader was then invited to go to town on the pages and submit the results.This book maintains the same overall format, but it updates it so that the story is about the X-Men, it is drawn by Andy Kubert, and the instructions take into account advances in technology, most especially how much computers can be used these days. These updates are very valuable, however there are fewer pencilled pages to ink over than in the original book, and they are printed in black ink, rather than "non-photo blue," as the first book was. This means inkers must use tracing paper rather than being able to ink directly on the art. Also, the Kubert pencils are exceptionally challenging to ink. I'm not suggesting that prospective artists shouldn't have to work hard, but rather that it is sometimes hard to tell what Mr. Kubert was trying to draw, especially wiht the word balloon placements indicated in black marker right on top of the art.There are five blank, pre-ruled pages in the back for pencillers to use. This is a good thing...the pages are very big. The full size, in fact, that Marvel uses for its originals.So if your need something to practice your comic art skills on, get this. But if you can get the original version, get that too.
I bought this after reading a few reviews and watching the tv ad. I am not the most coordinated person and detest working out, let me just say that first. However, the steps were easy to follow and I could feel the sweat dripping off of me throughout the workouts. I was eager to keep going. My eagerness wore off after the first two weeks, as the dvds were repetitive and I felt twinges of pain in my knees. I kept going. The first 3 weeks (despite following the calorie guide and writing down everything I ate and doing all DVDs religiously) I gained weight (4 lbs.). I emailed a person on the online site who told me this can sometimes happen and to not get discouraged (it was nice to get a response and online support...). I stuck with it and completed the 6 weeks, noticing my knees hurt worse and worse as the time went on, and in week 5 my lower back pain began. While the dvds are rather boring (what dvd workouts aren't), it was the sore knees and lower back that led me to write this review. I didn't have any substantial weight loss (net total loss, 0.8 lbs.) and did not notice any change in my clothing size though I did not measure. I think there are better programs out there for the money and think the moves should be taught/demonstrated better to insure no injuries arise from the repetitive movements (particularly on the knees). I just wanted to write to encourage others to purchase this item with care...
If you've been tricked into believing the LDS nonsense this book will help you become untricked and give you hope for leaving the LDS. It's tough to leave family and friends in the LDS or any other evil cult. Knowing the truth and getting the LDS load off your back will be worth their shunning.
I was going to write a flimsy review of this book, but after reading Bill R. Moore's post I figured "Why bother?" That guy said it all. I will only add that the beginning was interminable, with nothing happening and reading like an endless character sketch. The book improved as it went on, so I did not pitch it into the recycling bin as I thought I might early on. I was satisfied with the ending, which was very realistic to me. Yes, Babbitt went back to his old values and beliefs, but his midlife crisis served him well. We may not be able to change our essential nature, but we can learn from experiences along the way, which Babbitt demonstrated in his advice to his son at the end. The Babbitt at the beginning of the book would not have said the same things.
The author certainly knows about depression, but in this book his prose style and frequent tangents slow the reader down and are little more that detractors and fillers. You wonder if he is writing for himself: has he fallen in love with his writing style so that as many sentences as possible can be sretched out beyound usefulness. His message gets lost in these elongated thoughts, elaborate case histories that are overdrwwn as if he intends a shore story. See,for example case of the women who could not get her laundry done.His effors at style are overwrought and interfert with a clean message that is easibly followed.The CD is not any better option and should not be played while driving.
This is the worse so-called horror movie I've ever seen. I'm surprised an actor like Nicholas Cage would play in such a horrible movie! The previous reviewers said it all, but I just had to add my two cents. I was appalled, but the price was right--nothing! Had I paid seven-bucks to see this I would've really been appalled.
Schama presents biographies and anthologies of some of the world's greatest painters in a down to earth, entertaining manner. I wish there were ten discs and not just three.
This dvd will make you dance, cry and buy more to share with others. I bought this dvd and I must admit I have watched it over and over again I have a new experince every time. Some of my friends and family have watched it with me and purchased their own. I have brought several and gave them as a gift. The only thing I would change is the lighting but it does not take away from the dvd. That is if you are famailiar with the quality of reggae dvd's.
I agree totally with all the aforementioned, but it is important to consider one other factor; the sound quality on this package is "out of sight".That alone should give it at least 4 stars in my opinion..oh yes, I am an audiophile..so what?!
In my opinion, this is one of the only reality shows out there that is actually interesting and well-rounded, not just mindless entertainment. I love how the challenges are actually relative to the ultimate prize. Another great thing is that the judges (especially Tyra Banks) seem to really care about the girls; they're not just around to make nasty comments. Plus, the various conflicts between the girls may be staged, but they provide that just-right amount of mindless fun that's necessary. This first season is especially good, since the contestant's personalities were very strong (I couldn't get enough of Elyse/Robin cattiness!) Overall, very good show, very original, and very fun!
Arthur Golden's novel is a remarkable achievement, reading like an actual memoir, and so thoroughly researched you must keep reminding yourself that the jacket says it is a novel!Chiyo is a young girl sold by her father into slaverly, along with her sister, not long after her mother dies. Told from the innocent view of a 9yr old, the story does an excellent job of showing us how the truth of her situation is gradually revealed to her. (She truly thinks she is going to live with a nice family for a little while.) Actually, she has been sold to a slave-trader who then sells her to an "okiya" (like a roadhouse, except they "own" her until her debts are paid off)...the shocking part is this was totally legal. Geisha actually registered at an office of the government which had guidelines as to their "wages". She begins her tenure as a simple slave doing household chores and heavy cleaning, and the okiya mistress changes her name to Sayuri.Many people think a geisha is just someone who is a professional dancer or entertainer, they don't realize these girls were actually slave-cum-prostitutes whose only hope was to secure a very rich exclusive customer, called a "danna", in the hopes of someday buying their freedom. To do so was extremely difficult...they had to pay back the price of their "purchase", plus all the expenses of their education and support...and the okiya gets a cut of their income to begin with. Of course, they train as an apprentice under an accomplished geisha who not only gets a portion of their earnings, but will do so for the rest of their lives or until the apprentice geisha should manage to buy her freedom.The next-best scenario was to be legally adopted by the okiya mistress, in which case everything (including the okiya) will pass to them when the current owner dies...but they will not have their freedom as long as they are the adopted daughter of the okiya mistress.Mr. Golden does and excellent job of portraying, as the official review here says, "a social situation where careers are made or destroyed by a witticism, a too-revealing (or not revealing enough) glimpse of flesh under the kimono, or a vicious rumor spread by a rival." Indeed, the constant struggle during Sayuri's heartbreaking transformation from pre-teen girl to adult woman is almost totally defined by those things. Her hope and strength is fanned by a chance meeting with "the Chairman" of a local company, who instantly wins her schoolgirl heart by treating her kindly on the street. Indeed, we could almost, in our fantasy of a modern world, believe he is a true revolutionary until we are reminded that he has a wife and children.But perhaps the best proof of Mr. Golden's shocking talent for putting himself totally inside the head of a fictional 9-year-old girl of pre-war Japan is "her" (the book is told in the first person) "explanation" of the supposed difference between a geisha and a prostitute, and Kyoto geisha's almost snobby self-elevation above geisha from the rest of Japan. Even early on, the young girl does not see herself and other geisha as prostitutes, even though their virginity is auctioned off at 13, and though after 18 they are allowed to service their customers in exchange for money or goods and services...although a high-class geisha is supposed to "save herself" for a wealthy, and hopefully powerful "danna" (regular and exclusive customer). Of course, the vast majority of a geisha's time, even one with a danna, was spent in the fine arts and entertainment, mostly in the form of attending social gatherings, drinking and telling dirty jokes or gossiping with the men, or just escorting them to public functions.The ending is slightly dissappointing--slightly--and that's a good thing. One could see how Mr. Golden would be tempted to "sew things up" nice and clean (e.g., "they lived happily ever after"), or to have some tragic dissappointment. Sayuri is not portrayed as some highly moralized girl lightyears ahead of her generation, but rather as a strong and resilient girl who is a product of her time, but nontheless rises above her circumstances by holding onto her dream and through sheer grit and determination not to bow to the circumstances. Sayuri has her version of a "happy ending", and indeed, her life has become wonderful so far as a girl growing up in her situation could possibly imagine it. Exactly how this comes about is somewhat of a surprize, if just a hair contrived.I think Arthur's realistic portrayal of what a "good life" would be in the eyes of such an unfortunate young girl makes the entire story far more realistic and powerful. The novel brought tears to my eyes on several occasions!
I finished Dirt Music (Tim Winton) with a sense of loss. I was sorry to see the story end, especially as no clear conclusion was reached. That's okay, I'm a grownup, I can handle there not being a defined ending (I've given up on happy endings). Without giving any spoilers, a few thoughts:Tim Winton is so detailed and thorough that you get a sense of every detail in the scenes. The weather, the feel of the dust on your skin, the smells of the eucalyptus, as well as the emotions of the character are felt, not simply read. I didn't care for the main female character, I thought she was unsympathetic and apathetic to other characters, even the one she loves. The male lead is great, but of course, it's fiction! He has to be THAT perfect to make it work.The main themes are overcoming your own personality flaws, and the fear of being left behind. Winton's main character Lu has lost everyone he loves; on this journey he meets several characters that could represent those faces from his past. He also has to face the reality that his own perceptions from the past may have been wrong. Horrifyingly so.Rumor has it that this will become a film. Rachel Weisz is signed to play Georgia, which sounds fine. But there is a bit of a mystery regarding Russell Crowe and Colin Farrell. IMDB, the movie database, lists Colin as playing Lu. However, another report says Russell would play Lu. The other main male character, Jim, is pretty fascinating: he could be played by Russell but defintely not Colin. So I'm not sure which is accurate. I hope that Russell plays Lu, but he could do the character Jim Buckridge with a bit of a evil streak which might be interesting to see.I'd be very interested to see how a screenplay could be written to show the amount of time passing as well as do justice to the Australian terrain and the long stretches without dialogue. My first reaction was that it would be compared with Tom Hank's Castaway. I think Russell could carry that, I don't think Colin has that much depth.Anyway, this book had me take out the atlas, the dictionary, and use Google several times to see the trees and earthforms he describes. I think a geologist would particularly like this book, lots of rock talk.Lastly, I've noticed that in the three Winton books I've read that Winton seems to idolize children, almost in a mythological way. That's not a bad thing, but it just seems that the children in his books develop almost a fairy like quality of mystery and perfection
The beast of youth ministry is burnout, which is sadly a reality for so many youth leaders who start out strong, work tirelessly for the church, and fade into exhaustion-- and unfortunately, sometimes resentment. Youth ministry is difficult, and people who are just beginning their journey need advice from experience, advice that warns of those in the church who may hurt your feelings, advice that provides guidance in the planning of programs and curriculum... Advice that reminds you, "You will inevitably mess up; but you are human and you are learning. Don't give up!" This book is very insightful, and encourages people to take the long-term perspective, that youth ministry is about the marathon, not the short-distance race.Reading this book really is like sitting down with a mentor who knows the doubts and fears you possess- and those you have not yet embraced- and prepares you for reality, for better or worse. My suggestion: read it before you enter a YM position, and read it again six months into your position, and again 12 months into the position. The wisdom will be new every time you read it as you gain more experience, and you will value the reminder in times of confusion and concern, that Christ is with you always.
I saw this movie years ago and have always liked it. Ricky Shroader does a fantastic job, even at so young an age. What I read about this movie is young Shroader and William Holden were very good friends in real life. Bill used to take Ricky camping, hunting, and shooting with him and when Bill became terminally ill, well, this movie was sort of their gift to each other. Ricky's sister plays a small part in this movie also. Set in Australia, a dying man returns to his wilderness home but finds a boy who needs his guidance - and many things are passed on from the older to the younger. The Australian wilderness is beautiful and both actors are at their finest. My only regret is the quality of the VHS tape was poor and I really would love to see this on a DVD. Highly recommend to young and old alike!
Wilco is the Backup Band.Very GOOD album.You just can't go wrong with Tim's stuff.
While so many dinosaur books for children emphasize predator and defense relationships among dinosaurs, this book shows a more realistic picture of dinosaur life for young readers. My daughter is so excited to find a &quot;mother&quot; lizard with female roles of raising and defending young. We found this book used, but it would be wonderful if it could be reprinted. We really appreciate the scientific material presented in a way that is understandable for children.
At the beginning of 2003, 50 Cent got a huge smash hit with his super-hit single &quot;In Da Club&quot; and his gigantic (5x platinum) debut album Get Rich Or Die Tryin'. Now, at the end of '03, he is tryin to do what countless other rappers have tried to do, bring in his old crew and get them into the mainstream. This didn't go so well with rappers like Eminem or Ludacris, whose groups were hot for a minute but failed to repeat their success. G-Unit is the group made up of 50 Cent, Young Buck, Lloyd Banks, and incarcerated Tony Yayo. For the most part, their debut, Beg For Mercy, is just a gun-slingin' street album that gets very boring after awhile. Songs like &quot;My Buddy&quot; that are all about guns are boring because we've heard so much of them by now. The album is a waste except for the exception of &quot;Stunt 101&quot; and &quot;Smile&quot;, the only two tracks worth the purchase. G-Unit's problem is they are tryin to do something that never worked for anyone else around them. This album is littered with the ruins of remembering how hot D-12 used to be. In a year or two, 50 will be back solo (and even then he can't still be guarenteed success) and Young Buck, Tony Yayo and Lloyd Banks will all drop out of the limelight. Yayo will end up back in jail, Banks and/or Buck will release a solo album that flops horribly (reminiscent of Obie Trice) and the group will never see the light of day again.
I thought, hmm Sharon Stone, hadn't seen her in a while. Obviously, she needed the work, and the paycheck. In fact the whole cast in here looks to be collecting a check from the suckers who rent, or god-forbid, bought, this horribly cliche-ridden trash. This film was not scary, not suspenseful, full ofmore holes than a block of Swiss cheese, and a waste of most of the 'talent' gathered for it. Basically, a tragic event drives an affluent New York family to seek shelter in the quieter countryside, where they just happen to discover an abandoned mansion that they choose to purchase. It's not long before it's former tenant(Stephen Dorff) shows up on their doorstep unannounced, and does his best redneck creep impression. The cliches in here are laughable, the characters are weak and extremely stupid for such urban sophisticates. Basically, this film is a cheap version of a much, much better film, 'Cape Fear,'by Martin Scorsese, although a re-make of an earlier work, excellent none the less, with Nick Nolte and Robert DeNiro.
I went to see this film in theatres today, and while looking at the trailer, there was a sense of doubt with how this movie would turn out. I was hoping that it was just an odd feeling, and that the film wouldn't be this bad itself.It was.I didn't mind the opening credits, with Spielberg and all, but afterwards, it just started downhill and kept on going. The jokes were mediocre at best, the acting wasn't bad, but the plot, ugh, here we go.I know this is supposed to be a spoof of a James Bond film, but regardless whether the movie is spoof or not, a good plot is essential. The biggest problem that lead me to really disliking this film has to be near the end with possibly one of the most clich&eacute; plot twists that just made me nautious and hoping that there would be an explosion somewhere or another.The plot twists lead to unnecessary and unexpected personality changes which prevents this film from getting a high rating. If you think I'm just some nit-picking critic, take a look at this: I have seen many, MANY films in my lifetime, and out of those, I can only recall three that I don't like. Three, that's it.And if it's a rare cause that I dislike something, something had gone terribly, terribly wrong.
This cd would of gotten 5 stars but tracks 10 and 11 are just a strain on the album. I get really into this album and just noding my head and singing along all the way to track 9, and then I have to lose attention of the good songs in order to get through that achapelo and poor attempt to sound like and 80's hair band. I just wonder how they got on this label with such anti that label songs. Then again with other songs like "Sellout" I kinda saw it coming. Though like most other bands who sign big and realease a new album, this album dosent suck. Such as the case with Blink 182, The Ataris, and so on and so on. This is a great release that shows that they are holding steady to things and the fans that made them famous, not to mention they are some of the nicest guys around. Congratulations on making some money, but not for becoming rock stars. If you like this type of music check out The Mighty Mighty Bostones and Mustard Plug. Long live good music.
So far, I have only perused this book, but I can see that it is one of those essential items for your knitting library. I have several knitted articles that I've left unfinished as I waited for this book to arrive, so I can finish them professionally. I have no doubt this book will be a useful resource.
The radio edit doesn't have much commercial potential, but the remix on track 2 shines, featuring some jazzy drumming wrapped in beautiful string, organ, harp and synth pad riffs. The soulful &quot;my Zuleta&quot; vocal bit makes it sublime.
I've played some very lame games but this game is realy bad.All the cars suck in the beginning and it takes FOREVER to unlock other cars. If I could I wouldn't give this game any stars. THIS GAME SUCKS!
I wanted this set because I was interested in seeing "One Body Too Many". It's a lesser effort for all involved, but was a nice way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon wasting time. Since it came with 2 other movies, I watched them as well. "Corpse Vanishes" isn't much of a script but was also fun if you are feeling undemanding. Both of these movies are fairly decent prints. White Zombie is, from what I have read, the star attraction of this set. The print for it is ,by far, the most scratched and damaged of the three but it's a fairly good movie; one of Bela's better ones for the low budget studios. This triple feature set was very inexpensive, which made it more attractive to me as well. All in all, this isn't going to be a star attraction in most people's video libraries, but they are amusing and a fun way to kill a few hours.
These are good enough for what I need in headphones for walking around, but they always break. I mean, I understand that everything will eventually break - but things are only inexpensive if they last a reasonable amount of time. If these cost $15 and you need to buy 4 pairs a year, compared to ones that cost $25 and they last two years, the latter are the less expensive pair.Being cheap, I would prefer if these would just not break so easily - and it isn't that I'm being rough with them - I treat them well, but eventually they die (usually the sound goes out in the left ear).I am no longer going to get these, fool me... 4 times. Doh!
Ordered over a Roku HD device: film started and stopped every two minutes. This was especially annoying here because of theendless rapid dialogue.
Two things will tip you off that this isn't Disney's Peter Pan: Hook's first scene, when he props his elbow up on the table...and he doesn't have a hand, and the extremely creepy mermaids that will "sweetly drown you if you get too close." I wasn't much of a Pan-fan before this movie. In fact, the Disney version was probably my least favorite of the animated classics. We rented this one because we had recently viewed The Patriot and had one of those "who's the guy who plays the villain and what else has he done?" moments about Jason Isaacs. Well, right after renting this I went out and bought it. It is just a great movie all around. The production values are top rate, terrific acting (in addition to the extremely entertaining Isaacs, who gives 150% in dual roles as dad and Hook, I enjoyed seeing the great Richard Briers as Smee). I thought the script writer really caught the emotional content of the story, much more so than I would have expected. The special features are just as interesting as the movie itself. Highly recommended for anyone, it's not just a family film.
I have just been checking out the The 25th Anniversary Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame ConcertIt looks awesome . . . I don't think it aired here . . . OR I missed itAnyway I was wondering if this DVD set will play in AustraliaORHow I would find outAny help ?ORDo I just have to be patient (damn)and waitand waitand wait'till it's released here DownUndeR
Jess Franco has been known to make more than a few stinkers in his day and his recent pairing with One Shot Productions has allowed him to more freely explore his own inner monsters. Given a budget and unbridled freedom, you never know what to expect from the Old Maestro. But in INCUBUS Franco has harkened back to his spectacular 1970s heydays with a very close retelling of his LORNA THE EXORCIST film. Carina Palmer is pretty and compelling taking over the old Lina Romay role. Lina Romay herself takes on the role played by the iconic Janine Reynaud in the original -- how time flies! Sure the film has a lot of nudity and some very uncomfortable and creepy scenarios, but Franco has not been better recently and for the over-18 crowd this should be very satisfying. In a nutshell, this is the story of a man consumed by greed who makes a pact with a demoness and thinks he has gotten away with it. But 18 years later, his daughter becomes the devil's playground.
Wow! Let me repeat: WOW! Steinbeck is not particularly known for his humor, but in Travels with Charley, he lets everything spill out of the bag. I don't want to ruin anything about this book for those who haven't read it, but it is one of the top five travel books I've ever come upon. (far better than On the Road, and right up there with Travels in Hyperreality).Steinbeck packs his bags at the age of 60, and heads out to discover an America he claims he hasn't known for over 20 years. And although he never, in so many words, tells precisely what the White Whale of America is, I think he tells us the following:America is a land of people who want to go somewhere else so they can be alone; and the only reason they want to go anywhere is so they can come back and tell everyone about it.A word of warning: You will cringe at Steinbeck's description of the American South, and realize just how different it is than the rest of America.Also: it is interesting to note that at the height of his career (1960), probably only less famous than Ernest Hemingway of all world literary figures at the time, not a single person recognized Steinbeck in his three months abroad. Tell me that isn't depressing for any Leos out there with literary aspirations. :)
Great color and very heavy twill like material that washes and holds up to real kitchen use. Not just ornamental.
It couldn't be simpler: a flexible, sturdy plastic gizmo with a heavy-duty self-stick strip that attaches to your under-the-sink cabinet door and holds a plastic grocery carrier bag. It works perfectly and it's dirt-cheap. What's not to love? I have a run-down kitchen in which everything needs to be replaced, including the cabinets, so for me, this is the ideal alternative to installing a much more expensive rolling or on-door trash can holder in the sink cabinet. By the way, I ordered two of these and received two--no bonus bag holders for me. The shipping cost is reasonable and you'll receive it in a sensible mail envelope rather than a giant box (as Amazon would use).
This is a nice product, dependable and durable. The vacuum feature keeps the sink area tidy, good for haircut touch ups in between real haircuts too. Norelco T-770 AccuVac Beard & Moustache Trimmer T770
My mom who is a big fan of jackie chan hated this movie and so did I. The best part is when jackie fights benny &quot;The Jet&quot; in the finale. That is the only reason I gave it stars
Love these crackers and love Sabra brand hummus (pine nut and jalapeno are my favs) and they are excellent together for a quick snack!
I've had this device maybe 18 months. Works great. I like the look. It is comfortable. Paired up quickly and easily with my SonyEricsson K750i. I like the look of the black (versus the silver of the similar BT500v). The product is recommended.The only hitch is the charging system. The headset slides into a circular disc that has a 'crescent' shaped slot built into it to accept the headset. The wire that plugs into the wall for power then plugs into the disc at the other end. You have to have both items, then, to charge it. I cannot figure out why the charger simply isn't a one-part solution.And, from what I can discover, you cannot buy replacement/extra discs. This means that when you travel you have to unplug and pack both parts ... and that you cannot have a second charging solution set-up in the office or in the travel kit. Unless you want to buy an entire second unit and keep the second headset as a spare. I can't understand why Jabra would not vend extra discs (or charging systems) through their website.Other than that, I've been pleased.UPDATE: [December, 2008] I bought a second one in May, 2008 to keep around as a spare, actually mostly to get the second charger unit to keep packed in my ready-to-go travel kit. The headset broke after its third use. The hard plastic 'outside/spine' separated from the soft rubbery 'inside/belly.' And that broke a small wire inside. I Googled around and found such complaints on the rise for this line of Jabra products (the current models in the lineage are the 2020 & 2050). So I've turned it in for warranty replacement. I politely asked for a refund, but no dice. And since this model is out of production I won't be surprised to get a refurb unit back. Ugh. But I've also bought the well-rated Plantronics Voyager 510 to use from now on as my primary Bluetooth headset at my home desk. The two Jabra BT250v units and chargers will go to the office (where I rarely use a headset) and into the travel kit.To be fair, I should say the first BT250v unit I bought, which I've used daily, is still holding up well.
I bought this tank for my betta and he was very happy in it. He loved to hide behind the ship cutout. The whole effect with the little decals and such was adorable. My betta also loved having the extra space to swim around. I bought a small heater for winter. I tried the small Marina light that snaps on the top but it was partially blocked out by the black top. The filter did a surprisingly good job of keeping the water clear and was very easy to clean.
I have read almost the entire Nero Wolfe series, so even a half bake effort would've caught my attention. Fortunately, I did not need to settle because this was one sharply put together TV series. The sets are superb, especially the brownstone, which is mostly as I viewed it in my mind, except I would have Archies desk against the other wall so he could see the visitors faces while they sat in the famed red chair. I'll have to check the books for accuracy on this point.While Archie is the real draw in the books due to his ireepressible wit and self confidence, Nero Wolfe steals the show on TV/DVD. He is perfectly cast and plays the role with aplomb, even getting all the eccentricities smack on.My enjoyment of the series was only tempered by my knowledge that there is only one more season to view. It is unlikely that it will ever be done again. the american public likes brain dead fare, and NW requires you to engage your gray matter fairly frequently since all the facts are not spoon fed to the viewer.I highly recommend the DVD and the books...season 2 is on its way...ten will get you one that I enjoy the heck out of it :)
We have been fulltiming for 10 years now. I have been using one of these virtually the entire time. Trying to attach standard slip-on connectors without one is an exercise in frustration.Hint: Put the end of the sewer hose in hot water to soften it up first, then use this tool. The hose will then slip right on to the fitting.
Lucky In The Rain is a wonderful trip down memory lane as far as the songs that I all seemed to know. Lillias White and the rest of the cast is magical. This musical could have been written yesterday. I just finished listening to it again while skipping along walking my dog. After listening to it last night in my recliner I forgot how creamy silk it is. I bought it a few years ago and loved it and played it daily for about a month. Now it's back in my mind and fresh as ever. What a lovely way to spend some time.
"If you read all the poker books and become a technical expert on which hands to play and how to play them, you are still likely to end up broke."If you just want a book on how to play poker, keep looking; there are lots of those. Although this book has some play lessons and elaborate mathematical charts, it's more about the life of a pro. I recommend it for everyone with or without professional aspirations. This was intended to be part of Doyle Brunson's book but became a book in itself.BG discusses cheaters (and he names names! and casinos), deadbeats, critics, his own life and ethos, who to tip and why (that was a real eye-opener!), sex and how it can affect one's game, superstition, tournament strategy, and much more. There is poker etiquette I had not read elsewhere, such as how to win gracefully, and why it's important.It has COLOR plates. (Red hearts & diamonds --how's that for a switch?) It's chock full of color photos of famous players and casinos, like a scrap book. It has an index, plus a separate index for the photos so you can see who's in them.One caveat: My worst days (in terms of losses) started with me reading from this. Every time. Superstition? No, but for whatever reason it put me in the wrong frame of mind to play. (I found it a bit depressing in places.) After a few of those, I would only read it on days I did not play.
I am a long time fan of the author's books, and this one wasn't in my library yet. I can't wait for the rest of his books to come out for the kindle. While not his best book, it had everything that I liked from his style.I also really like it when authors include parts that weren't included with the original release. The ending was perfectly fine as it was, but it was nice to read the added epilogue.Some of the concepts are clearly outdated. The imagination of the future from an 80's SF point of view, but taken with the knowledge of when it was written, they work with the story. If you are looking for some campy 80's pulp fiction, this book is a dollar well spent.
I bought this CD strictly for the one song "Rose Colored Glasses". I should probably have downloaded the one title as I don't care for the rest of his CD.
It's perfect, and even more heavy duty that I was expecting. It's perfect form my needs I use it for simple sheet music when I play classical guitar, and I use it to prop up my iPad when I'm working too. Very great stand. Worth every penny I paid for it.
Mr. Cave achieves the almost impossible in this work: not insulting the reader. Take the most common literary comparisons, O'Connor and Faulkner, and there's something vital missing, and I'm certain that is J. M. Coetzee, specifically "the life and times of michael k." A masterwork of obscurity, this character study is solid, consistent, and worthy of any handy yardstick. It's conveniently impossible to empathize with Euchrid, and the discipline it took to pull this off is greater than it's given credit for; Cave jumps into the deep end in this anonymously southern novel without a life preserver, and the narrative bobs and lurches to survive drowning in filth and hatred to great effect.The only reason I give this book five stars rather than four is that a major plot point is left delightfully unclear at the last second.--spoiler follows: avert thine eyes--Did Euchrid have sex with Beth or did she get pregnant by some other means?
This book is a transcript of W. Murch's lecture on the theory and practice of film editing, edited for print and updated to include recent developments in NLE's (Non-linear editing systems).A real eye opener. This was my first contact with Mr. Murch's perspective on film editing and I was blown away. Through psychological theory and a clear and grounded perspective on the practice of editing (developed from years of experience), he explores how we relate the film experience to our real-life experience and why film and film editing work as a compelling and coherent medium. Since reading this book I have passed it on to all of my film maker friends and they have all raved about it. Before you begin another film or video project, READ THIS BOOK.
Sleepy Hollow is an awesome movie. Its dark and yet it seems to have a hidden humor about it (mostly thanks to the talented Johnny Depp) Johnny Depp, as in all of his work, protrays his part perfectly. The is not only scary, but also magical and a little romantic. And the costumes are beautiful! Especially the Stripped dress shown in the last scene!
Although an unexpectedly fine romantic comedy, "Teacher's Pet" is also an amazingly accurate depiction of the newspaper business in the mid-20th Century. Gable and Young steal the show, but Day deserves more credit that she gets. This is an intelligent,insightful, funny movie that could double as a master class in journalism.
This Loren Gold Album ROCKS! Got it today on release date and am amazed by the HOOK-EY songs and depth of the album. Just a great pop/jazz vibe, as keenly reported at the [...]. Amazed Amazon has these in stock and glad they are available here! The tracks are solid and emotionally appealing and run from happy/peppy to dark and brooding. All with a superior sense of SONG - meaning these jazz tunes FEEL like there's a singer with a verse and chorus even though it's all Loren Gold on KEYS and often Mindy Abair on Sax. Great find!
"Dirty rotten scoundrels" is without a doubt one of the highlights Broadway has to offer this year. Most people are familiar with the 1988 movie starring Michael Caine and Steve Martin and it is upon this movie the musical is based.This is the second show written by the composer and the lyricist David Yazbek, the first one, "The full monty", being also made on the basis of a movie. This recording confirms David Yazbek's talent for writing excellent musical comedy shows, a genre that often seems to be underrated nowadays.The story corresponds to the one in the original movie: we follow the adventures of the two tricksters, Lawrence (John Lithgow) and Freddy (Norbert Leo Butz) in the French Riviera, while they are trying to woo a rich American heiress Christine (Sherie Rene Scott). Of course, things are much complicated than that, so in the end the story takes an unexpected turn.This CD has the principal musical numbers, thus being a nice summary of the show and at the same time it is also a very enjoyable listening. The score boasts with the tuneful melodies that win over the listener from the very beginning. However, this show would loose much of its appeal if it weren't for David Yazbek's catchy and humorous lyrics. There are many lyrical parts that will make you laugh throughout this show, "The Bushes of Tex/Were nervous wrecks/Because their son was dim/But look what happened to him", being just one of them. This sort of clever and witty remarks blends perfectly with the liveliness of the score.The cast was wisely chosen. John Lithgow has just the right amount of humour and sophistication the character of Lawrence calls for, while Norbert Leo Blutz and Sherie Rene Scott are also very noteworthy. Joanna Gleason must also be mentioned. She plays an American divorcee Muriel, and her rendition of "What was a woman to do" is one of the best songs on the CD.The CD comes with a synopsis, libretto, the lyrics and the production pics. Apart from the main musical numbers, it also features a funny warning message from John Lithgow for the home listeners and three bonus tracks. Two of them are demo recordings sung by David Yazbek himself and the third is Sherie Rene Scott singing her big number "Nothing is too wonderful to be true", accompanied by the piano only.If you are looking for a good show from the current Broadway season, or simply a fine musical comedy, look no further. "Dirty rotten scoundrels" will provide both plus a good score packed with witty lyrics.
Does this show lend credibility to the conspiracy theorists views that we were and are still being visited by aliens? That is up to the viewer to decide. Does it offer the ultimate proof? Again up to the viewer. Personally, I am open to all possibilities. As the great physicist Stephen Hawking's has said on more than one occasion, it would be arrogant of us to believe we are the only intelligent life in the universe. I did not quote it, because I cannot remember the exact words. But, I am certain those are close to what he has said. The people who speak here are doctors in their field of study. Therefore make informed commentary's throughout the show. If you are open to the possibilities, this is a great source of information. If you are not, well, I would not watch this show as it will only aggravate and confuse you. If you however, want to learn about those questions that mankind has asked for many century's, again, I would certainly give this a try. I gave the show five stars not only for the information and educational value, but for the entertainment value as well. I wrote this same review for the first episode disc that is out there. But, I actually own this season.Wasitchu
Marey Carey's "THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI" is an excellent collection of songs. Listening to this record, you are reminded why you liked Mariah in the first place: that voice. Truly one of the best tones and ranges in pop music, Mariah can sing low and high without any problems in between. The lyrics of most of these songs contain wishes of love to return and going to the club, having a good time. There are a few "filler" songs on this record. I'm not a big fan of the song with Snoop Dogg. I thought the song on "Rainbow" was better, even though the lyrics on the previous song were a little jagged. However, she more than makes up for these songs with "Mine Again," "Circles," and "Fly Like a Bird." Definitely, if you are a fan of music, pick up Ms. Carey's. She's back......and is sounding better than ever.
sometimes it's hard to look at the man/woman in the mirror, when you're ready to, read this book but make sure you're able to make the necessary changes which accompany the emotional insight.
As a heavy-duty ballroom dance fan, I found this the best of all the ballroom dance films - for sheer talent. I had no idea Vanessa Williams was that good a ballroom dancer, let alone such a fine actress and a stunning woman. Chayenne, not the best actor around, is nevertheless somewhat sweet and charming but he cannot hold a candle to the firepower of the professional ballroom dancers. The scenes where the competitions take place are fabulous, using real ballroom dance champions, doing real, not bastardized, ballroom dancing.The story-line behind the dancing (and it *is* behind the dancing) is a nice one but predictable. Chayenne is a Cuban immigrant on a trip to meet his American father (Chris Christofferson), who doesn't know Chayenne is his son, fathered by him in an old love affair aboard a cruise ship. Chayenne arrives to do handyman work at Christofferson's dance studio and the latter soon realizes Chayenne is his son, which creates tension between them. To me, that aspect of the film was padding and could easily have been omitted in favor of more dancing.The better parts have to do with a clash in dance style between Vanessa Williams' character and Chayenne's but they work it out and it becomes great fun to watch the two free-form dancing together, and dancing with others at small night clubs.Truth to tell, I wish there were far more ballroom dance movies of high quality like this one. The other ballroom dance movies are built more around love stories, such as "Strictly Ballroom". "Shall We Dance", with Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez is also good but doesn't have the professional spark that "Dance With Me" reveals.(Not that this has much to do with ballroom dance, but I am still waiting for some hugely talented person to release a high-quality DVD of just Fred Astaire's dances. JUST the dances with dates, partners, name of film; no interviews, no talking, just his dances, with and without partners. If anyone knows of such a DVD, I'd sacrifice my firstborn for it!)
These are very expensive looking glasses. They aren't small! Like a good size rocks glass. The bubbles are a nice touch.
I've enjoyed reading the whole series along with my daughter over the past few years. We'd get each book as it came out; she'd read it first and then I'd read it and then it was fun to talk about the new book. But as the series went on, or I should say dragged on, the plots turned from compelling to silly, and our interests waned. Still, we kept up and wanted to see it to the end. We did, and we're sorry that a talented author wasted her gifts and our time.The series actually could have had a satisfying ending after book 23, when The Organization was defeated. But Ms. Kaye apparently wanted to have a personal ending for Amy. That's all well and good. In fact, the book started out well enough, with Amy's talents disappearing, and there was some fine and meaningful discussion about how things that come too easily don't have much value. Ms. Kaye had an opportunity to produce a fine ending with a real message, but she completely blew it.In fact, Amy's character, as developed all through the series, was completely undermined and destroyed. Instead of the good, ethical, and unselfish heroine of the rest of the series, Amy ends up as vain, conceited, self-centered, egotistical, and, well, not a very nice person. Ms. Kaye utterly trashed Amy as a worthy protagonist. Can this be what her readers wanted? I doubt it.And, Amy going off to be a flying superhero, working out of a Florida hotel? What could Ms. Kaye have possibly been thinking?Do yourself a favor. Stop after book 23. It's a satisfying end point, and you won't completely ruin your entire experience with this series. If you read book 24, you will be sorry you ever read even one of these books.
This book has been sitting on my shelf for a couple years now. The stars must have been in alignment last night (Valentine's Day), because I had the precious time to read it, and really enjoyed it! I am a fan of Anne Stuart, but have to say that while she's known for her very "Bad Boys," I was surprised that while our lead, Jamey Rafferty, a real Chicago gangster, was very intense, he was very honorable. I loved him. Stuart based this novel on actual events. Here's a quick history:On February 14, 1929, four unidentified men, members of Al Capone's gang, two being dressed as Chicago police officers, stormed into a North Side Street garage and ordered seven members (Rafferty, the story's hero, being one) of the North Side Gang against a wall which they apparently did willingly, believing their captors were real (and comparatively harmless) police. All seven men were then shot and killed with a Thompson submachine gun. Witnesses saw the uniforms and assumed that everything was under control. It was total chaos.Stuart brought the feeling of the 1920's to the present day. This all actually happened in Chicago and Stuart has written this story as if all 7 members have been returning for 48 hours every year on Valentine's Day to get the chance to redeem themselves by falling in love and in turn staying mortal. Which brings us to our heroine, Helen Emerson; she's a state prosecutor and the only daughter of a very large Irish-Catholic family of cops. Helen's been targeted by a sadistic killer from Rafferty's past and he's determined to protect her. It was a great set of circumstances, a great set of characters. This book really was worth hunting for; unfortunately I don't believe it's currently in print. But if you can find it, it's a true gem.
The truth in advertising police should go and knock down the door of the Antica Italia Pasta sauce company. When I drink flavored vodka, I expect to be able to shake or stir, but this stuff is too thick for drinking. I added tonic, ice, and a lime, but still to no avail. Try Stoli or Vox instead.
This book was a huge disappointment - the ending left me feeling like I had just wasted hours of my life away.At first, I enjoyed the plot and thought it had potential, and that's the only reason I kept reading...I was excited to see how she would tie it all together. But she never did. It was just a big waste.
Another reviewer said &quot;Francois Truffaut once said that it is impossible to make an anti-war film. He meant, I suppose, that war will always appear glamorous, no matter how realistically it is portrayed. This film certainly proves the truth of Truffaut's remark. Shakespeare lays bare the vain and selfish motives of the combatants; Branagh emphasizes the dirt, discomfort and brutality; yet it all seems glorious in the end.&quot;Bzzt. Wrong. Anyone who could leave this film feeling that it's not adamantly anti-war simply doesn't understand it. As virtually every other reviewer has said, the scene in which Henry wades through the carnage of the field at Agincourt fairly shouts that any such battle is a Pyrrhic victory at best: he, the perpetrator of the carnage, is appalled and aghast at what he has wrought. And lest anyone mistake the &quot;We band of brothers&quot; speech as a glorification of war, it is not: it is a moving -- and clearly heartfelt, given what we've seen of Branagh's Henry -- paean to solidarity in the face of insurmountable odds. The only caution I'd give anyone watching that scene is that by the end you'll be heartbroken that you can't follow him wherever he goes.Frills like &quot;The making of...&quot; and the other sorts of additional material that are usually on a DVD would be painting (not gilding) the lily in this case. This film would be worth owning even if it were poorly recorded: sometimes the message is much more than the medium.
This adapter was purchased because of the convenience that Amazon Prime eligibility offered. Note that while this review was created, this product no longer had said eligibility as this often fluctuates.The RCA adapter that I received measured in at 8 1/2" end to end. Despite the excess plastic flashing that appears on the connectors, they seem to have been manufactured and assembled well. Regardless, it would be best to use caution while connecting/disconnecting.The signal provided is typical of what you would expect to get from RCA stereo. The wiring is rather thin but overall this product has good value.
I really dont use guides that often. My friend purchased this guide for me and it is really awful. Bad layout and small fonts fill this cheating device. POint less screen shots show awesome graphic but, you could play them game and see awesome graphics. if you buy this cheat guide you cheat your self. the idea is not to finish as fast as you can its to have and tons of fun. I used the wrong gun a enemy several times and each time i was dis membered. But as my limbs where ripped from my body on my computer animated me the real me was laughing my head. Dont get this. If you really want to cheat use the web you get it cheaper and theres not shipping involved
At the time of this writing, the Item Weight for this product is 4 pounds. Sounds like a great deal, eh? Of course the Shipping Weight is only 2 pounds, but, hey, that's still a lot of cat nip, right?Here's the deal: you get one package which contains just over 0.3 ounces (9 grams) of catnip. When you buy from non-Amazon vendors -- even if the order is fulfilled by Amazon, you never know what you'll end up with.
There has been in the 21st century a tremendous revival of the operas of Rossini, kudos to singers like Matteuzzi, Blake, Palacio and Gimenez, and now Juan Diego Florez, Barry Banks, Lawrence Brownlee and others.Rossinian tenors are lirico leggieros, or tenore di graze. The timbre is light, feminine and elegant.Gimenez owns just the right dosage of lightness without sacrificing masculinity. Unlike the other famed Rossinian tenor Francisco Araiza who sings Rossini in utter elegance of style but also with an unprecedented virility, Gimenez could be said to be the more typical Rossinian tenor of the two.The timbre of Gimenez is more lyrical in comparison to Florez and Banks', and he sings with better agility than Brownlee. His voice has body as well as agility, some thing not to be taken for granted in tenors of this genre.This album is a wonderful introduction to the art of Raul Gimenez's wonderful Rossini interpretation.
Starting off with "Is it on Tommy?" Nothing but the Truth! The cover is beautiful and some nice tunes here with only a couple of duds, which is very good. The best w/o Robin Trower lead guitarist extraordinaire!
Why do some people hate this movie so much? I just don't understand. I mean I can see how it isn't a movie for everybody to love but the vitriolic statements of some people are just unfathomable. And why, oh why must the dreadful Mystery Science Theatre be evoked so often in reviews on Amazon? Now that show was really some thing to complain about and the sooner it is forgotten, the better.
Make sure that you are looking for bags for the mini, as these are smaller than the regular once. I needed the regular size, so at first I was disappointed, but when I went back to the ad it did say &#34;Mini&#34; on the ad, so I can't fault the seller. It was my fault for not seeing it.
from the Iko-Iko-like kickoff, this sly rampage unfolds into pure pleasure. 'Think a cut or two in the middle are sub-par? You'll like them soon enough and see how they fit in the groove. How many records do I take down from the shelf 30+ years on and like exactly the same way? This is in that small club.I met Cheif Landry way back when. They never saw dime-one out of this, but that he wasn't mad. He was getting mail from all over the world!
This book is a great description of what could be done, but the tools to do it are not herein. I was hoping this book was going to have more than just herb descriptions, alas it does not.Some things that the Author forgot and which seem important: dosage for individual herbs (this is pretty important), chinese name of herbs (neither the pin-yin nor the symbol are given). And, in the formulas section (which was the main reason I bought the book) the formulas just list the herbs and not their proportions! WHAT!?! How unhelpful.To know that herbs are in a formula is great, but it is not a formula without the proporation of ingredients. Although this book has great descriptions of the herbs and their uses, it lacks the implementational aspects which are critical to using the herbs! The truth is: this book is a marketing tool for the Author's herbal supplement line. Be careful...
This book is designed in the same format that most of the BRB Publisher texts are. Opening chapters are of general interest, moving into state by state phone and online information followed up by several appendixes describing online vendor information companies, government URLs, and privacy information. The State chapter which is 80% of the book, is broken down as: State Agencies County Courts Federal Courts Local Courts and County Record Retrievers This section is very resourceful, giving in detail what is permitted in that location and who can get the information for you. It appears that several of the BRB publications have been combined, and added to, to create this excellent source.
"What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day" wasn't the story I expected from reading the package blurb; it was better. I checked it out of the library because it looked like it might be a decent listen while I went about my daily activities. Usually I find modern novels disappointing, but this one hooked me and kept me interested from the start.The story is told in the first person by Ava, whose hair salon begins to fail after she is "outed" as HIV+ and nervous customers stop coming. She sells the salon with the intention of moving across the country to San Francisco. What happens when she drops in to visit her sister Joyce, a community activist, in a small Michigan town before making her big move is the substance of the book.The dialogue and many aspects of the characters rang true, which is one of the great pleasures of a novel for me. Okay, Eddie may be a bit too wonderful to be real and the reverend's wife perhaps a bit too evil. And there were a couple of situations where it seemed that in order to advance the story Cleage didn't let the characters think of obvious solutions to their dilemmas (leaving me to mentally yell at them things like "Call the police!", but that didn't greatly detract from my enjoyment. Some of the action is horrifying to hear, but not in a horror-story way; more like a shake-your-head way -- at things you know people actually do.My main criterion for evaluation a book is how much I enjoyed it and whether I want to hear something else from this author. Since I was sorry to come to the end of the tape, I give this five stars.Ironically, it was only after I had almost finished listening that I realized (from reading the box) that I was hearing an abridged version of the novel. The abridgement was not at all obvious to me, so I think it was well done, but of course I wish there had been more story to listen to.
I wasn't drinking much water because the tap water tastes like pool water and the fridge filter takes f-o-r-e-v-e-r to fill up a cup, so I got this. I love it! A couple times a day I put more water in it until I'm bored, and I can drink as much as I want. Since drinking good-tasting water is so easy now, I'm more hydrated. I use an off-brand filter for the refill, because the pur ones are so expensive, but this is a great dispenser.
This was not classic Grisham...it ventured away from courtroom drama and dealt more with legal proceedures regarding the last will and testament. While the journey was a successful one and I did enjoy the book, I enjoy the courtroom battles that are Grisham's forte. Overall, though, it was a very entertaining book.
I love Kinley's books. I love Knights and Scottish Highlanders. I love a hero and heroine that love each other and not afraid to fight about what the want. I love the passion.This book had all that, so I Sigh.......and what for the next book.
This movie should come with a bonus pillow, because you are going to need one before the end. Seriously, this has to be one of the worst movies ever made. It is over long and drawn out to the point where most people in the cinema where I made the mistake of initially seeing it were struggling to stay awake by the time the actual attack began. Admittedly the scenes which feature the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor are impressive from a CGI point of view but tend to look more like an intro sequence to a video game than anything resembling reality. One low flying sequence in particular has the P40 fighters behaving like flying saucers in some cheap 50's Sci-Fi movie. While I realize that some artistic license is required in the making of this type of movie and that some historical inaccuracies or omissions will occur, this is almost comic book stuff. It is a convenient fact that only two American fighter aircraft managed to get off the ground and engage the Japanese on that day but to suggest that these were two childhood buddies and that they both then somehow managed to fly in Doolittle's raid on Japan is insulting to those who actually did. But in the end this sums up this movie, it is a formula American buddy movie that contains all the attributes that makes these types of movie so dire and cringe worthy. Why they named it Pearl Harbor is beyond me when that event only took up such a small portion of the movie. To call it that would suggest an attempt to document the actual events surrounding this historically important event but this is lame romantic claptrap that just uses it as a backdrop. If you want to see a movie about the subject then try Tora, Tora, Tora. There are some fine performances in this film, which must have been hard given the dire nature of the script. Cuba Gooding Jr. is excellent in his role as real life hero Dorrie Miller but Ben Affleck gives his usual impression of a block of wood in a gorilla mask. I would not waste my money on this DVD no matter how cheap it gets and I'd advise anyone reading this not to waste nearly three hours of their life watching it. Avoid!
Light-hearted by nature, Steven Levy gives everything the proper treatment in an often amusing way without being irreverent, and he becomes serious where warranted.This book presents a balanced perspective from both sides: privacy advocates who do not necessarily trust the government, and government authorities terrified of losing their precious wiretaps and other snooping capabilities. The actions of a few self-righteous, overzealous mavericks on both sides are recounted.Examples of successful U.S. government eavesdropping are mentioned; for instance, it was monitoring that revealed that the Libyans were the bombers of Pan Am flight 103. There is example after example of how the antiquated, rigid NSA position that "crypto is munitions" stifled the ascendant American software industry in the 1990's by restricting exports, giving foreign competitors the edge, while the rest of the world already had strong crypto anyway! Asinine inconsistencies in the old export restrictions are cited. The players of the NSA, NIST, and Congress are named and events, from assembly bills to telling conversations, are recounted. I think most crypto enthusiasts will find this recap informative. It certainly filled in a lot of gaps for me!The book does not pretend to be a primer on cryptography. Levy does his usual admirable job of reaching out to the masses with lay explanations and clever analogies, but this being specialized math, it will at times go over the heads of some readers. Levy has a good sense of how far to take a technical explanation before dropping it; he doesn't go around the bend. Historical cryptographic systems recounted in David Kahn's tome "The Codebreakers" are now passe, not just because computers do it faster, but also due to relatively recent mathematical discoveries. The chronology of those discoveries is told along with the human stories behind them --of those who yearned to understand the art of secret writing and came to realize that it boils down to hard adversarial mathematics.The human story throughout is one of unassuming, unlikely geniuses whose discoveries got no immediate fanfare, rather taking decades to catch on. Today (ironically now that the patents have expired) those discoveries are in use every day by most people using the Internet, a cellular phone, or any other wireless device.The book is at times dull. To me, the accounts of legislative machinations were slow-going but I don't see how they could be made more interesting.Jim Bidzos is finally vindicated as a real hero of the crypto revolution (after being portrayed in a bad light in a book on PGP). Diffie/Hellman/Merkle, the Cypherpunks, anonymous remailers, Julf Helsingius and Penet, David Chaum and digital cash protocols, court decisions, the Clipper chip --it's all here.Did government spooks discover public key crypto first, in secret? The book ends with the interesting and hitherto unknown story of James H. Ellis of the General Communications HQ, the British cousin of the NSA.An index, a small glossary, and an appendix of references are included. Well done!
When I first heard about this movie-and saw the previews, my plan was to let it pass me by, but since it starred Kate Beckinsale, I decided to give it a try when it came out on dvd.What a mistake-this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen-the plot and storyline are pathetic--and if there are any redeeming qualities at all it's the visual special effects--but they're not really able to save this clunker. The move does have some gore--but no fear factor. Avoid if at all possible!
I've read a lot of books about talking animals, and Runt the Brave is up there with the best of them.Runt the Brave tells the story of a mouse, JaRed also known as Runt. He's small, as his name implies, and isn't the most popular mouse in the kingdom of Tira-Nor. Nevertheless, he is anointed to be the next king by the seer. From there, things start to get hectic. Rats attack, and everything goes down hill. The story follows closely to that of King David in the Bible. Over all, the basic plot is simple; almost clich&eacute;. But it's what Schwabauer does with the story and characters that make this book so good.I'll begin by answering whether or not the books serves its purpose. And that answer is yes. It serves its purpose very well. It is extremely entertain, and I'd go as far as to say it's gripping. It's a fresh, exciting read, and very original.The writing is quick, and the author doesn't fall into the usual pits that most other authors fall into. In fact, he not only doesn't fail, he succeeds on every level. He utilizes all of the best writing techniques to his advantage. I wasn't disappointed in the least. I was happy to have found such a solid read.The characters are true to themselves to the end, are dynamic, and interesting. Schwabauer mad them seem important and relevant, and I cared what happened to them. The decisions they made changed the course of the plot, which may seem contradictory in the sense that it follows the story of David in the Bible, but that's the brilliance of the novel. He doesn't only stick to a story that already has been laid out; he uses it to his advantage by making the characters move all the pieces into place. He makes the story his own. Not only that, there is nothing allegorical about this book at all. No heavy religious overtones with over-blown themes. The book make hints and gestures without getting in your face.The dialogue is smart and singular to each character, and there is a good balance between passages of prose and dialogue.There is enough action to keep the pace up, good battle scenes, and well-crafted subplots. This is a much darker book than Redwall, for example. Schwabauer isn't afraid to harm his characters. The bad guys are bad, and it's very apparent, which makes the book all the more believable, despite the fact that mice are the main characters.There isn't much more to say. Frankly, Runt the Brave is a solid read, written almost flawlessly, with good characters, good dialogue, and a fresh, new story. I couldn't be more please. I highly recommend this book to anyone one enjoys a good fantasy, or just a good read altogether.
I am facinated by Hawai'ian music. Eventually you become querious about the "original" Hawai'ian style music. I now have 4 CD's of chants and this is my favorite. There are NO funeral chants, which seem to bring me down, I prefer to hear happiness and sunshine in music of the islands. Death is unevitable, but I would prefer to think of other subjects.
I was very impressed with Driven, and I anxiously got Takedown, with high hopes. While this book was fairly good, it just lacked depth. The plot was somewhat predictable, there was no cliffhanger type moment, the character development was weak, and the ending was flat.I was disappointed, to say the least.This book didn't take long to read at all, it is very simply written and does not have much substance. It's not bad; I've read worse, but it could have been much better.I doubt I will remember anything about this book in two weeks.
This book works pretty good. I still get some occasional pain in my wrists and elbows, after a long day (and evening) at the computer, but the exercises help about 80-90%. You don't have to do all of the exercises in the book; I do 10 of them, and those ten take up 7 minutes daily. Not a big price to pay for avoiding carpal tunnel syndrome! There are other things you can do to prevent or reduce CTS, like taking a B-complex vitamin supplement daily. I take 25 mg a day; 50 mg is also fine. Don't buy the extended-release forms---they can cause liver damage. Taking vitamin B6 alone may also help, but don't take more than 100 mg/day for extended periods, because you could wind up with even more nerve damage than before. For a detailed list of nutritional supplements and their potential side effects, the book The Failures of American Medicine is a good reference.
Thanks for shipping to an APO box. We appreciate the support of shipping items to us while deployed.Thanks again.
Purchased this as a mattress protector for my son who still wears diapers. And his bedding reeks of urine so much we're having to change his sheets very often. We just bought him a new mattress, so we wanted a little protection against the odors. So far so good. We were not having seepage, per se, but my son is 7 - and hey, some boys just don't get it so easily. Anyway, for a smallish 7 year old, it is not noisy at all. I agree it's not very deep so some of the nice pillow top mattresses won't be able to use this pad at all. If you have a thinner mattress and no major leakage issues, this is a perfect pad for you.
I use this pot whenever I need to make large quantities of meals for myself. It's just the right size and is very heavy-duty. I've used it several times, it fits in my dishwasher and looks just as good as it did when I got it. Highly recommened for those of us who cook a lot.
I loved the size of this unit. I don't understand why so many other manufacturers have such big boxes. First six months it was fine, I had it set at 480P feeding a Samsung HLP 6361 and the picture was fine (I'm on the list to get a Samsung 941 as I want the 720P upconvert HDMI). Anyways, this thing doesn't read disks anymore, period. It started to freeze a few months ago and then just stopped working. Save your money
This is a 5 star book because it takes you down to the lowest level of detail without losing you. This is primarily due to the book's excellent organization where each chapter builds on the previous ones. Although it calls itself a reference, it's an excellent sequential read to learn what TCP/IP is about under the covers on Windows Server 2003.
It refused to play. Only a heap of junk. A 50-year old radio would have been a wiser investment! Atleast it would have served to be an antique item.
Authentic isn't the word you'd expect to use in describing a band with a British lead singer and Swedish musicians that plays Texas blues, boogie woogie, Creole inspired rock n' roll and maybe just a dash of classic west coast R & B, but here it is. Mike Sanchez's clever pairing with Knock-Out Greg & Blue Weather has birthed some tremendous sounds for this premiere release from Mike's new label Doopin Music.This imminently danceable CD provides 16 catchy new cuts and a bonus 20 minutes of extras.This album jumps with instant rockin' energy in "Cadillac Baby," and invokes the ghost of Bill Haley with "All She Wants to Do Is Rock." There's a nice revisiting of material from some earlier releases in "You Gonna Win," and "I Need a Woman." Listeners will definitely enjoy the raucous boogie woogie and Jerry Lee Lewis like musicianship of "Strollin' with Bones." A catchy stand-out is the excellent "Gambling Woman Blues," and there are some nice slow pieces with "The Voice Within" and "If Lovin' Is believing."The CD packaging is a gorgeous fold out sprinkled with pin-up beauties and the aforementioned vehicle of choice for the rockabilly enthusiast. Dancers will make out well with the album, featuring at least 5 tracks that are east coast friendly, along with a bundle of upper tempo rocking action.
This book is basically a short monograph for the recent college grad interviewing for a job. Unfortunately the book covers too wide a range of all possible interview situations - from professional counseling to dealing with the media - in too shallow a detail. The author attempts an overly formalized method to deconstruct an interview situation and then uses that format to present the latest research without adding anything of his own. The result is a too technical book for those with no interviewing experience and too basic a text for those who interview for a living. Some interesting research on resume construction and the counseling process, but not enough discussion of basic things such as rapport building to be of interest. The guy adopts a cool sounding title based on the radical French movement of Situationalism and the latest at the time trends in psychology, but the subject at hand does not justify a deconstructionist approach and his treatment of teh subject is not radical in any way shape or form.
This is the story of a little girl who refuses to do any work - she would rather be catered to by her hard working mother. Lo and behold she manages to get in the queen's good graces with the help of a big old lie and needs the help of 3 fairies to get out of her predicament. The story is a twist on several familiar fairy tales - with a somewhat happy ending, although the little girl wouldn't say so. The moral? Those who work hard will be rewarded in the end, and the work itself can be its own reward. Lisa Campbell Ernst always has first rate illustrations which I love, and my daughter is always drawn to stories about princesses and fairies - so this book was an instant hit.
While not as shocking or tight as the first 3 years of the series. AbFabs 4th season is in a head and shoulders league above what one can currently see on TV. With episodes that beg for additonal viewings in order to absorb the Britishisms, the season 4 DVD is a fabulous treat. My favorites have to be Paralox, and Donkey. The outtakes and the inclusion of the Mirrorball special episode make for some additional fun on the 2nd disc. A running comentary with Jennifer Saunders is a welcome treat as well.....have yet to hear it though. Saving that pleasure for a rainy day...Enjoy, sweetie darlings....;)-~
This is a great book. Any cookbook can give a list of recipes, and one can almost always find a few good ones, whether the book is from a celebrity chef or whether it's put out by the local lady's club in an effort to raise some money for charity. What sets the really great cookbooks apart is that they give a method, a set of techniques, which if followed, allow the reader to understand the recipes, to play with them, to embellish them, and to invent his own. Books like Julia Child's The Way to Cook and Madeline Kamman's In Madeline's Kitchen come to mind. They make you a better cook. Paul Kirk's Championship Barbecue is definitely in this company. He gives the theory and technique of barbecue--the essence of which is slow, low temperature cooking with smoke. The book is divided into sections, talking about marinades, sops, mops and bastes, rubs, sauces. In each section he tells why a particular ingredient should be used, always encouraging the reader to use the information and invent his own. Following are absolutely terrific sections on the barbecing of pork, beef, fowl, seafood and side dishes. The idea (perhaps conceit would be a better word) that this book is a guide to turning the reader into a barbecue champion is not meant to be taken literally. Paul Kirk states early on that what sets him (and other champions) apart, is not just the recipe and not just the technique, it is the consummate care with which the technique is applied. Still, by inviting the reader to reach for the stars, he encourages us to be the best that we can be. While not many of us will ever have the talent to be barbecue champions, I have no doubt than anybody who loves food and who wants to try, can make absolutely wonderful meals with the help of Paul Kirk's Championship Barbecue.
&quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; is a true work of art. Ever song on this CD is unbelivably great! Roger Water's lyrics are very meaningful and David Gilmour's guitar playing is the best, especially the guitar solo in &quot;Time&quot;. &quot;Us and Them&quot; and &quot;Brain Damage&quot; is a good example of Pink Floyd's great talent. This CD is a must for the Rock Fan!
I always have great luck with this product. It cushions my wrists gently, but firmly, so they don't after a day at the keyboard. I have the matching mouse pad, which is also fantastic for the wrist.I was really surprised that it worked well with the small Mac keyboard. Your hands are in a different position than with PC, but that doesn't seem to impact the effectiveness.Great buy for the price.
I loved this movie, man. However I can't give it anything higher than a single star. It could have been great but for one very important issue. The Centurion who is present when the earthquake occurred during Christ's crucifixion states "Truly this was A Son of God!" WRONG! Read the Bible my friends, the Centurion said: Matthew 27:54 "Truly this was THE Son of God!''Whether this was simply a misspoken or flubbed line, some slack oversight by the writer, or an intentional, calculated misrepresentation of the Word of God designed to throw confusion into the mind of the viewer.. I don't know. If I had been working on this project and I'm sure this movie was proof-edited before being released, I would have caught that. Man, when that scene came up it literally hit me like a ton of bricks, man. Did he just say "A Son of God?" NO, NO Please, I hope I didn't hear it correctly. I had to play it again just to make sure... Yes, they screwed it up, man. Shame. Other than that, I REALLY, REALLY liked this movie. I wanted to love it, to give it honor and stuff you know. But that one glaring little bit just derailed the whole love affair I was having with this flick, man. I thank God for movies about Jesus, man. I love the Lord and I want His Words to be remembered accurately. This is not a small issue in my opinion.. Of all the lines, of all the scripture that they could have tweaked, THIS is not one that should have been touched. Don't mess with the Personage of Jesus, man. I thank God for showing me the truth in these matters. I share them with you. THANKS GOD! (Spoken while pointing both index fingers toward the Heavens!)
This cd rocks, like Fight the system, from beginning to end.If you dig punk rawk, check this out!
I saw this during a "free" viewing of Showtime on DirecTV. Okay, so this guy eats what amounts to eight or nine meals a day at McDonald's, doesn't exercise, and blames the corporation when he gains weight? Oh, please...Hey, Spurlock and those of you who love this so-called documentary; IT'S CALLED "PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY"! LOOK INTO IT!I agree that the typical American diet is far from ideal, but far-fetched, ridiculous stunts like this add nothing to the discourse.
I don't like Sci-fi. Star Trek missed me by a mile. And I didn't want to like BSG. I remember loving the original series when I was a kid- but even then knew it was an attempt to cash-in on the Star Wars bandwagon. As a middle-aged adult, I had every expectation of this show being strictly a geek-fodder, lowbrow CGI fest. But this show is something else entirely. But the storyline is actually ridiculously compelling, especially as you move through the series and get into season 3 and start to explore the Cylon perspective. The analogs to contemporary America are thought-provoking and frequently alarming. The characters sometimes drift into cut-out caricatures, but then some new revelation drops and the entire frame of reference for these characters shifts radically into something orders of magnitude removed from workaday sci-fi action figures. The art direction is spectacular: the shots of the various ships moving in space are really quite beautiful, the way the ships move seems entirely realistic and true to motion in zero-gravity environments. I actually just ordered this final installment and can't wait to see how this all shakes out. Give it time- it grows on you powerfully.
What an unexpected surprise, I downloaded the Kindle App for my iPod Touch and since this book is public domain, it was a free download. I had never read this book (can't believe it, 55 and I never read it) ... well, not only is the Kindle on the iPod a very nice app the book is outstanding. Now, I much prefer reading any book on the Kindle, I wish the electronic price would come down a bit as the cost of printing and shelf space is not a factor, if it were, I'd buy all my books on Kindle.
This book is very concise, yet deeply informative. I am a PHD student in early modern europe, and I must say the person disgruntled about the lack of artistic discussion is a bit misinformed about Renaissance Italy. Art was not the only phenomenon coming out of Renaissance Italy. It consist of much more, and the humanistic side helped develop Florence on an economic/ political level that was very important. Whereas art appears to be the central them to the Renaissance, it is not. The book is well written, easy to follow, and is interesting. If you are looking for something more artistic, look for something published by an art historian. Brucker does a good job hitting a variety of points. One must remember that the book is looking at FLorence during the Renaissance, not art alone. Major political changes occurred, etc. If you are looking for a text that discusses Italian politics during the Renaissance in more detail I would suggest a book by Daniel Waley titled The Italian City-Republics.This is a great book for Renaissance history courses, but also is done well enough that the non-specialists can easily follow. If you want a book that solely focuses on the artistic side of Renaissance Florence/Italy I would suggest Frederick Hartt's History of Italians Renaissance Art.
Unless you don't mind playing good money for 33 minutes of comedy avoid buying this CD until you've heard some of his better material. There are some flashes of brilliance but overall a disappointment due to its length. The music tacked on the end seemed to be a poor way pad the length of the CD. Louder Than Hell &amp; Live From Hell are better bets.
It is good to learn that the Bible was not completely divinely inspired by God, but had many ideas inserted by regular men who were more interested in their own self gain.
I did find this book for like 5 dollars on ebay, so your getting screwed out of your money if you buy from one of these sellers here. I read the book a few months ago and would just like to say that it only took me a two days to read it. I got sucked in and couldnt put it down until i was finished, its books like this that are true diamonds in the ruff when going through the hugo award winners list.
Just great stuff. As I've gotten older, and have more responsibilities during the day, it's become really rare for me to stay up past &quot;bedtime&quot; to read a book, but this one kept me up. The premise -- a drug that allows doctors to induce Near Death Experiences in an experimental setting -- is ambitious, and Willis handles it well. The early part of the novel, when Dr. Lander and Dr. Wright are interviewing people right after their experiences is down right frightening. I thought the book was going to turn out to be a horror story rather than sci fi. But once Dr. Lander volunteers to be a subject herself, the book changes tone and becomes more of a mystery. The characters are great -- particularly Maisie, a little girl with a heart condition who is at death's door. And the weaving in of historical information is a lot of fun too. If I have any complaint, I'd say that I would have been tempted to omit the final chapter, which I think was unnecessary and actually diminished the impact from what it would have been without it.
I used to be a big Van Damme fan. Timecop, Hard Target and Lionheart are still among my favorite action movies. However, recent Van Damme's movies are rather weak. It is my personal opinion that without a interesting original script and quality professional actors portraying the "bad guys" Van Damme's movies aren't' worth the time nor money.Brief comments about this movie - very lame story, much weaker than Segal's Under Siege 2 Dark Territory. Some sickening pictures portraying Small Pox outbreak. Supporting cast, excluding Tomas Arana, Laura Harring, range from weak to complete amateurs. Also, special effects are very weak.On the positive, if you love Van Damme, you will see him doing his usual stuff in the movie. Also, his son makes a theatrical debut with some nice martial art moves.Overall, I would rather watch again one of my favorite Van Damme movies than this one.
Hands down the worst "food" I have had in 6 months of Atkins eating, and very possibly vying for the worst thing I have EVER put in my mouth.It looks like powder, floury coming out of the package. But with some liquid it comes to a reasonable look, simulating the appearance of mashed potatoes. That is where the resemblance ends. On the first bite, you start out with the hope that here is a product you can use. Nearly immediatly you will notice the textural difference. There is a grainy dustyness that is apparent. But, its bound to be different, so you power on. Texture is only part of it, and the difference is not horrible, just different.Very very soon thereafter, your tastebuds will tell you the rest of the story. There is no "potato" taste. It tastes more akin to some sort of wheat product. Ok, whatever. But then you realise there is another taste. Something akin to alum powder. And it is horrible. So much so that you swallow quickly and wash it out, and take a rapid bite of something else to get rid of it. a few moments later, you will convince yourself that since you paid for this, you will try again. It couldnt have been all THAT bad. But it is. And the third little nibble 20 minutes later is equally horrible.Later that night you may notice that it drys more like a dough than a mash, and wonder what happens if you bake it. The answer is nothing good. Same taste. Not worth the time.Do yourself a favor and skip this product. I hate cauliflour, but even blended cauli is better than this. I am stumped to think of ANY food item that is not better than this. Not pickled pigs feet, for sure. I suppose Durian is a match, but I would literally rather eat worms. If you buy it, don't say I didn't warn you.
After the seriously out-of-the-box effort of Hear in the Now Frontier I was ready for a change of pace--and knowing how QR reinvents their sound without reinventing themselves (or their delivery) Q2K was a step in the right direction. This was a welcome departure into a much more basic, raw and aggressive sound that is not unlike the band's Seattle-based contemporaries. The much lamented departure of Chris DeGarmo did have an impact but this is a mature band that obviously moved on. Kelly Gray contributes well to the crunch and wah-wah of a more grunge-flavored sound with this release. Not original-yes, but certainly effective and passionate. Lyrically this is not as strong (evidence of DeGarmo's absence here), but I found this to be a solid musical statement. My personal favorite here is the opening track &quot;Falling Down&quot;, which has a duel solo break that is so simple yet so inspiring. Eddie Jackson's bass sound has never been more rude than on &quot;Burning Man&quot;. Other tracks of note are &quot;When the Rain Comes&quot;, &quot;Breakdown&quot; and &quot;Liquid Sky&quot;. I agree this wouldn't be a good introduction to the band's music. Nonetheless, Q2K rocks hard here and for that, 4 stars is well warranted.
This is an excellent translation of the Gita and I would recommend it to anyone interested in Hinduism. But why stop at chapter six when the Gita has eighteen chapters? I don't get it. It's not finished. As good as what he has translated is, it would be great if he had completed the job.
It is unfortunate that the word &quot;video game&quot; applies to this fantastic work of art. If not for the actual game action in this title, it would certainly pass for a great movie.First of all, the story is superb. The character development is very deep and detailed. You get to know each character as the story unfolds. Their motivations and history are revealed. Each character harbors some sadness and tragedy, but this aspect alone draws you closer to the characters. As in the other FF titles, there are monsters galore to fight and puzzles to solve. There are a great deal of movie sequences in FFX, so sometimes the action is put on hold in lieu of the story line...which is really a great idea. There is a very good balance of action and movie scenes in FFX.Each time you battle or find treasure, you are sometimes rewarded with magical spheres. After accumulating a certain amount and type, you will be able to upgrade your characters through upgrade grid screen. The system is a little confusing at first glance, but it is learnable within a few rounds of battle.There are a lot of very inpressive looking games out in the world, but many of them lack depth or game play value. FFX is a total package...stupendious graphics, innovative game play, terrific story line and terrific movie scenes. It is too bad that video games cannot get Oscars as Final Fantasy X would have definitely taken away a few of the awards. For the RPG'er, the state of the art game has manifested itself and has become the standard for all others in Final Fantasy X. Kudos to the SquareSoft team for making such an enjoyable masterpiece. Of all the titles that I have played, I believe FFX to be my favorite.&quot;Video Game&quot; is much too mundane a term for FFX.:)
I'm surprised ar some of the two or three stars for this awesome ending to such an amazing fictional family series. I've had this book for years now and I know that I can always go back and read this and not be disappointed.I think she spaced out the dual romances very well and I think it helped that each couple is on their own journey in a way. I love a story with a cute child or baby in it and I just think that Caleb is a delight to read about and imagine. I have to say I am more interested in Cole's part of the story than Ryan but that's mainly because I knew him from the other novels in this series.I think that the murder mystery was very well done and well described and I think most readers will be surprised by some of the twists and turns in the mystery.My only quibble with the series is how little Mama Rose got to say in all of the novels not just this one.I think Julie Garwood is one of the best writers in the field of historical romances and if you want a sexy, funny, romance with history and a little of her more murder mystery inclined stories then I think you should give this novel and the other novels in this series a shot, you won't be disappointed.
After learning my lesson the hard way on my previous car, I decided to start off on the right foot with my new car, and get a Seat Saver as soon as possible. After just a day of going "naked", my leather seats were already showing pinch marks.My interior is black and tan, and I picked up theBritax Parkway SGL Booster Seat, Nutmeg, which matched brilliantly. I thought this would be pretty close, but the color isn't really beige or grey, despite the box showing a color that actually comes reasonably close to matching my actual interior."So the color's weird? Big deal." Besides the color, the product itself just screams of mediocrity. Getting the base portion on was no problem, and it does a fine job of protecting my seats. The back part, though, is something you basically have to align against the car seat and child seat when you install it. Unless you're driving an '83 Ford EXP, there's just no way it's going to cover properly when the base piece and back piece are attached to each other -- unless you have teeny tiny back seats.Normally, I wouldn't be so harsh on a product for something like that, but when it costs twice as much as base seat protectors, the back should be as good as the base.This Seat Saver gets the job done, but only barely. And the awful color has me looking for something else to replace it.
One of the best. For it's day the effects are very good. The story moves along well. Having the widescreen available really enhances the film. This is a real classic that many sci-fi movies coming after it owe big time. I love having this on DVD.
I like the small size because it makes it more portable. Little girls just love cute plush animals and this makes a great gift.
I am a true opera novice. I only recently started listening to Opera after a few weeks ago I was dragged to see one at the Metropolitan Opera. Didn't expect to love the show or even to grow to love the music, but I did! When I got home I decided to purchase the Album and got this one as it had great reviews. I've an Elementary or lower-intermediate knowledge of Italian and this helps someone like me to appreciate this art form even more. In fact listening actually helps me improve my italian after a while. I don't know anything about crescendos or arias or allegros or why a conductor waves those drumsticks around or whatever- but I can say that there is SO much emotion coming from many of singers voices on this recording. My friends think I'm crazy when I put it on because we tended to be more of a Rock, Pop and Alternative-Jazz crowd. I just love this album and I've listened to it almost every day since receiving it.
Archer is in its 3rd season as I type this and it's still, if not, better than the previous two seasons. But this review is for season 1 because it was fantastic. I read that some reviewers commented about the DVD extras suck. Seriously? You would rate it down for that. The show alone gets 5 out of 5 or 10 out of 10 or 100 out of 100 because it's so damned hilarious. I'm not sure why this didn't exist before. Oh yeah, Frisky Dingo. Meh, I'll stick with Archer. Voices are great, the animation is stiff but you get used to it immediately, because it's about what the characters say and the situations they put themselves in that makes Archer so damned fun to watch.Totally worth the price for multi viewings with friends or alone. There are so many hilarious quotes in this show.Archer: "Lana. Lana. Lana! LAAAAAAANNNAAAAAAAAA!"Lana: "WHAT!?"Archer: "Danger zoooone!"If you can't find this show one bit hilarious, something is wrong with you. Just saying.
A beautiful book. So wonderfully written that savoring the words was a joy, never mind the sensitive yet powerful story. Though the topics -- deafness, World War One -- suggest a very grim work, it ends up being a powerful affirmation of life.This book deserves to be much more widely known than it is; it's an excellent example of how even good books deserve ample promotion, as I think that it's a lot better than some major recent best-sellers. I was pleased to see in a bookstore recently that it's won an award.
Martell's piece is a good way to kill a few hours on a flight between Vienna and New-York. The lay-out makes you believe you are actualy reading SEAL mission real paperwork. The different missions covered, which lead to the final assignment, are well done, and for the average, weapon-unfamiliar person, rather precise. Not totally accurate, but precise.The drawback comes when by mid-book, the reader has more or less lost track of what the book is all about. Besides, all goes well for these SEAL guys. I doubt real missions go as smoothly as the book's ones; This special ops unit is definitely good at planning, but THAT good makes it slightly too...&quot;Hollywoodesque&quot;!Pictures instead of drawings might have helped as well.Overall, a good reading for anyone having interest in this military, counterterrorism warfare business, and definitely a must-read for the Special Op Wannabee.Does not grant a second burst for everybody else.
As another reviewer wrote Conway Morris produces lots of examples like Darwin. However unlike Darwin the examples aren't convincing, we fail to go from the 'could have' to 'must have'. Attacking both sides in the great evolution debate (both Dawkins and Gould come in for a hammering) also doesn't help - there's not really enough room for a third front! And the last two chapters are just disastrous ultimately meaningless waffle. Get this book from a library
First came the video collection for &quot;Little Earthquakes&quot; and now this one. This one includes some live versions of songs that didn't have videos made for them - which is a HUGE plus. One of the most artistic videos on this VHS is &quot;China&quot;. You'll love it. I wholly recommend this to any Toriphile out there. Whenever I'm in a quick fix for Tori, I pop this in and turn my volume on full blast. Afterall, Tori is Tori. 'Nuff said.
Let's face it, we're currently in an age when pop music is progressively getting worse and new ideas are fast running out...Ever since the Rob Dougan track 'Clubbed to Death (Kurayamino Variation)' was featured on the original Matrix soundtrack, I've been waiting for the day when I could hear more of his work. Plain and simple, it's been worth it. Dougan spent eight years, maybe even more, working on this album. On 'Furious Angels', Rob Dougan is the composer, the solo vocalist, and the entire orchestra all in one. This man is INCREDIBLY talented. I can't believe the instrumental string parts were all entirely written by him. And at the same time his obvious influence from Electronic music allows him to be modern-sounding enough to capture the attention of today's audience. One thing I really enjoy about his music is that he doesn't allow the percussion to become repetitive or to distract the listener from the actual music.The best thing about Dougan's music is probably his voice. Some reviewers have commented that his vocals don't fit the instrumentals, but I strongly disagree. I think his voice is what makes his songs so strong, dark, and emotional. Perhaps there is no better example than on 'Left Me for Dead', a song that seems to be about a hit-and-run accident. Dougan beautifully captures the pain and anguish that such a situation could cause. On 'There's Only Me', he howls out in vain on a song that could be themed around loneliness and isolation.Another reviewer didn't like how track 13 is silent, and claims it's a copy of John Cage's famous 4'33". I don't consider this CD to be a copy of anything, really. If you look at the structure of the album as a whole, it's almost as if Dougan is inviting you in on a private concert. There's the Prelude at the very beginning, the actual meat of the performance in the middle, the silence towards the end where the applause would take place, the Coda to wrap up the show, and then the encore track 'Clubbed to Death 2' to win the audience over.Best track on the album is easily 'Clubbed To Death (Kurayamino Variation)', the record that broke Rob Dougan into the public's consciousness. I don't even have to explain why this song is so good. It's an awesome attempt at taking two styles of music that you would NEVER expect to work together (the strings of Classical and the beats of Hip Hop), and putting them together well enough to create something totally fresh. The result is nothing short of a masterpiece. I also enjoy the title track 'Furious Angels', 'Nothing At All', and 'Speed Me Towards Death' very much. All in all, every song on the CD doesn't disappoint. The album is very well balanced and each track beautifully flows into the next.>>> A perfect 5 stars. An epic masterpiece. This album is flawless. Gorgeous art direction and album design as well.* BEST ELECTRONIC ALBUM OF 2003. Yes, I know the year isn't over yet but I dare you to find me a replacement.- the enlightened oneIf you enjoyed 'Furious Angels', I would strongly suggest such albums as Robert Miles' 'Dreamland' and Chicane's 'Behind the Sun'. They both seem to capture the same artful taste as heard in Rob Dougan's music.
Always Love Dawn French. Don't see enough of her these days. Idiots abound in this one so it's always, FUNNY, FUNNY, FUNNY.
I love all of Hayao Miyazaki's movies and I loved Ponyo. This was the first movie in a theater that my squirmy 3 yr daughter ever saw and she was simply entranced and actually sat through the whole thing. I recommend this wondrous charming movie to any age group and any person. It is artful and marvelous.Now given all that is this particular DVD version the English dubbed one that was seen in American theaters? It is very confusing. The Amazon page gives the American Actors as the principle players in the animated movie and then says it is Japanese with English Subtitles. I am very hesitant to buy this version for my kids since it does not appear to know what it actually is.
Here's some money wisdom for you, don't waste your money on this book. This is the first thing I've ever read by Suze Orman. She sounds like a fruitcake. All she talks about is religion and other bologna. Her book has nothing to do with money other than flaunting her wealth. I'm not sure why she calls the book Money Wisdom, other than to exploit the public's hunger for financial information. After reading this I would never consider reading anything else she writes. I can't believe PBS let's her on to do free infomercials. Sample of her advice: put ten grant a year in a 401k and with 9% interest you'll have lots of money in 20 years. DA! That's not advice that's a spreadsheet. Advice is telling people where to get the extra ten grand and the guaranteed 9%. I'm just glad I got this book from the library instead of wasting my money. Now that's money wisdom.
He has drawn and painted children since his teens. I liked how he painted his youngest sister Violet from the time she was born in 1870 until her marriage to Mr. Ormond. His paintings of children are diverse, from the kids from the Lily Carnation picture, to the upper class work study of the Boit children, to the teenage picture of Rosina nestled on a tree limb in Capri.He really showed his craft in painting the diverse pictures of children. He may not have had children, but his interest in them were very sincere and touching.
Unlike most of Budge's other works, this is written for the layman to understand. Though he still cannot resist showing off his skills as a scholar, one doesn't need a vast knowledge of Hebrew, Greek, Coptic, and Arabic alphabets to gain the book's full value (I often wonder if at some point in his career Budge didn't "sell out," writing books that people outside Oxford and Cambridge would want to read.). Virtually every amulet and talisman is covered, along with their proper use and materials they were made from. As always, the introduction and stories Budge gives are fascinating as well, giving tales not generally told in modern times and the various mechanics of how the Egyptian priests and magicians performed their magic. One can see why Budge's work is still in print, as he offers the reader a maximum of research and scholarship with none of the new-age BS that is so common in such books written today.
This is the most idiotic movie I have seen since I made the mistake of viewingThe Hustle. It is very hurtful to see people of African descent in 2012 actings like bufoons. This movie is a poor imitation ofFriday (New Line Platinum Series). Even the music used whenever the local bully appeared is the same as in "Friday." The UK television and film industry doesn't give work to actors of African descent in serious dramas (notice the lack of main character roles for men of African descent in their popular television shows except Idris Elba inLuther), so they are forced to takes roles where the acts like deranged clowns.
I can't add anything to all the excellent comments about this extraordinary LP/CD, so I'll comment on Spencer Dryden's drumming. I have always liked his tomtom work (I'm a drummer). They seemed to have the same acrylic sound as Iron Butterfly's Ron Bushy. He has no problems with time [signature] changes. I was first impressed with his drumming on "Rejoyce"; then his intro solo on Bless Its Pointed Little Head's "It's No Secret." He's excellent on "The House at Pooneil Corner" (from this LP/CD), the way he plays through the 7/4 middle of that song. Then he plays very tastefully on "Triad" with his ride cymbal (if you can't hear it, or never listened to it closely, turn up the high end). Simply gorgeous. I think, after listening to Dryden, his trademark sound is on the tomtoms, but it's nice to hear him break out when playing live. Great album: Crown of Creation.
I have read some really bad reviews about the picture quality of this collection. I really have no issue at all with the picture quality..true its nothing above average but the sound is sensational! and it conatins MANY MANY missing videos by Madonna that had never been released at all before on VHS or DVD! Im happy with my copy..Its like almost four hours of Madonna videos and the quality is not as bad as some claim..True its missing some clips but mostly all the very BEST of the BEST videos are there...plus the other two compilations that she released years ago have basically got some of the videos missing here...so Im happy..Madonna - The Immaculate CollectionMadonna - Video Collection 1993-99
Laughter and annoyance followed the arrival of this terrific book. I was having so much fun with it that I was sent to my room so I didn't ask another riddle. I'll pass this on to the other "children" I know for their enjoyment too.!
Bear Family does it again! If you are a Ricky Nelson fan, you can't go wrong. The book is excellent, and the songs sound superb! Please don't settle for the "Legacy" box set, although that one does span his entire career. But who knows? Perhaps BF is working on a collection of his Decca output...
i saw this movie today for first time, good actors, beautiful scenery.a very enjoyable movie. More than i can say for todays movies.
Aspen Pittman, whom I have met and talked to at several industry conventions such as NAMM and AES, is not a highly technical individual: in fact I doubt he even understands basic electronics. His book is therefore a compilation of a lot of schematics and (on Fenders) parts layouts for guitar amplifiers, and a few articles written by various tech writers, some of which are of merit and some of which aren't.The schematics are not very legible and many contain known errors. For this price, he could at least get that part right. I don't recommend this book unless you cannot find a needed schematic or layout anywhere else.
I enjoyed this book from Lindsay McKenna. The characters were likeable and the plot was interesting. The only draw back was the excessive use of Reckon, gal and other "hillbilly" word usage which got in the way of some of the conversations. Other than that, enjoyable book to read!
This music rocks! It doesn't sound Beatles at all - more like some odd combination of John Lennon's Plastic Ono sound and a noise band.Listen to the opening track &quot;Why&quot;, though...the bass and drums really lay down a groove, the guitar is dissonant, and Yoko's voice is crazy, agressive, and confident. It's like nothing else you'll hear, but it's all done so well. I think it's worth picking up.
These work best with the ambient lighting is somewhat dim -- the red laser line really pops. Since red is the opposite of green, it makes any green laser completely invisible. I wear large glasses (58mm width lenses) and these fit comfortably over them.
This is avery tedious CD. Not just the rather uninteresting music, but most especially the boring way in which McKellen reads the wonderful Creation text. Give me Haydn's Creation any day!!
Difficult to read this book. Many books on Buddhism are written in this odd, flowery manner. If you don't already read other books on Buddhism, you may find it disorienting.
For years Petty fought the estabishment over price increases on the old vinyl. The Releasing of remastered versions of his CDs was an opportunity to right a wrong. Most of Petty's records run under 40 minutes. It would have been nice, as long as he was cleaning up the sound, to throw in a few varities. The Box set is way, way too bloated to buy into.None the less, this is a 4-5 star CD. Right up there with Full Moon Fever, as his best work.
My computer is about 8 years old & it was way past time for a memory upgrade. Love my PC now. People throw things away too easily these days. Besides, I get to keep windows XP & don't have to worry about my printers & other things working with windows 7.My computer is very fast now. Noting to adding this memory. If you think you can't do it. You're probably wrong.
This book is simply the best horror book by Stephen King I've ever read during my whole life. And I doubt if I'll live to read a better one. What touched me in this book was not the horror itself. What makes this book a must-read &amp; re-re-read is the plot along with the characters. That's the most human book of Stephen King, the one where he could tell the world &quot;I'm one of the best writers of this planet!&quot;. And yes, he really is. If you pay attention to the inner feelings, the ones that are not described in the book but the ones the author makes the reader wonder about, you'll face feelings, emotions and people that are inside us all, but that we rarely show to the world outside because the mankind lost the capacity to move, the capacity of be touched by things, of letting your heart cry... That's what Stephen King works in here: the true emotions, the feeling of losing and don't knowing how to go on without the ones that go... Things like that. If you want a book of wonderful story, if you want a book of true feelings, that's your book.
I agree with Steele's main point: that US society's only real motive in supporing affirmative action (and other policies that seek structural solutions to structural problems) is not authentic concern for American blacks, but merely trying to assuage a sense of guilt.This is a great start, and I'm very eager to see this interesting idea developed! But unfortunately Steele takes it nowhere fast. In the end it just turns into bad writing based on plain old unexamined assumptions, instead of reasoned argumentation and support. Provocative ideas like this deserve better.The main problem is the author simply assumes not that his POSITION is right and others' POSITIONS are wrong; but that HE is right and anyone else is wrong. But he refute their ideas, he has to at leasten to them for a minute; and he doesn't. Instead, it turns into really silly double standards of the sort: I am reasoned, THEY are fuzzy-headed; I uphold principles, THEY are beholden to superficialities; I voice my objections, THEY mindlessly repeat slogans; I am responsible for my freedom and agency, THEY are all cowed and cowardly. I am strident; and they resent that! And so on, and so forth, until you don't know which is worse -- that, or his interminable verbal benders where he seems intent on constructing as many sentences as possible entirely out of abstract nouns. (Try the Shelby Steele drinking game: take a drink for every sentence including any three of the words "freedom", "merit", "virtue", "ulteriority", or "responsbility". Double-score for for "moral accountability".)Now, some writers just have their quirks, but Steele's bad habits just go on and on until they crowd out absolutely everything else. He overuses scare quotes. He charges ahead with weird generalizations that just leave you scratching your head: "Thus kitsch is always an invitation to a consoling sense of superiority." It... it is? Always? Invitation? What? "Ersatz virtue will thrive precisely to protect us from the risk of being stigmatized that real virtue always entails." It does? "'Diversity' and 'multiculturalism' have no substance as ideas except where they connote perfection exactly where America was shameful." I try to figure out what this means, but I can't get past the scare quotes and the nebulous abstract nouns and the assertion of a negative. Any decent editor would have said "Shelby, can you just say what you mean here?". But his publisher apparently didn't think he was worth a decent editor.Steele seems happiest when the abstract nouns he's constellating are nice short words that gloss over the grey areas of American life: upholding educational "standards" glosses over the possiblity that one's SAT score may be a measure of nothing more "virtuous" than one's ability to score well on the SAT; "responsibility" and "individuality" and even "freedom" are clean-cut concepts only in a world where everyone has equal access to credit, education, and personal or family wealth. But he treats these all as absolutes; you're free, or you're not. You're responsible, or not. The dualisms pile up.And the grandest dualism of all is his view of American ethnicity: black people, and those white people who feel guilty about those horrible things they did to black people, what with national original sin and whatnot. With this laughably minimalist view as the starting point, it's no wonder he strains to fill 180 pages. Life is so simple when you can see only two colors.And all the while I had the nagging feeling that if Steele'd bothered to have a look at the relationship between Native Americans and white America's guilt manifest thru government, he'd have a much broader and deeper history to test his abstract generalizations against. But why ruin a good theory with bothersome data, especially complicated data with lots of grey areas? But THAT could have made for a book worth reading.
Fantastic alternative to something like icy hot. Smells fantastic, and can heat and sooth those tight, knotted muscles. recommend combining with a little of jojoba oil, or similar oil, since the smell can get a little strong if not cut.
Wake up Paramount! Take a cue from your sales on the STTNG sets. Now that you have finally come to your senses and dropped the prices on the sets to where they should have been in the FIRST PLACE, I would imagine that all of the hold-outs (like me) are now buying them.See, it works like this, 30 minute shows on DVD, for a season, have earned a market fair price of $25-35. So, since Star Trek episodes are an hour long, that means a fair doubling of the price puts it into the $50-70 range. So, $60 is your sweet spot.You will be able to take in the obsessive fans with your initial insane pricing points, but everyone else looks at your current price tags, especially with the shoddy packaging that you are still foisting on us, and just laughs and waits for the inevitable price drop. So, do us all a favor and fire your marketing and sales people, drop the price to where it is supposed to be, and earn your sales. Nobody sane is going to pay more than $60 for a season of an hour long/episode TV show on DVD, period.
This movie was horrible. I rented it instead of buying it (Thank God) because I still love the cartoon. I was hoping that it wasn't as bad as the critics said it was. The funny thing is...it was worse! The acting was horrible. The plot didn't even follow the cartoon formula. It was so dumb that I would have turned it off but I fell asleep. Save your money for something funny and entertaining like Monsters Inc. or something else. Do yourself a favor and rent this one.
This movie is a good action/thriller with nice cinematography and a plot that keeps you guessing until the end. The ending is a bit cut off but I liked it all the same. And if you enjoyed this movie, check out Broken Arrow with Christian Slater.
While its true that this album is no &quot;Blue Skies...&quot;, it is still REALLY good, and catchy too. So yeah, go get it...
The most important thing to know before buying this book is that it is *not* a comprehensive discussion of the ballgame itself, the mechanics of play, or its role in everyday life. It is, however, a comprehensive discussion of known archaological sites as of 1991 with detailed summary data for hundreds if not thousands of sites from the mayan region to the America southwest. The book is a collection of academic papers that arose out of an archaeological conference, so you should be prepared to expect highly focussed analysis and minutely detailed information with only loose continuity between chapters.There *are* interesting discussions of the mythic and political roles of the ballgame, as discernable from ceramic art, stone art, and the mayan written record.The production of the book is fantastic: the reproductions are amazingly clear, the drawings are superb.In summary, this is an excellent -- although aging -- physical survey with some cultural conclusions, but it assumes considerable advance knowledge of what the ballgame is, how it is played, and its role in ordinary life.
I bought this in order to transfer photos from my PC to an SD card that is used in a Smartparts picture frame---instead of connecting the picture frame directly to the PC. I find it easier to do this way. The MobileMate is fast, works well, and is very convenient.
Great movie for kids who have not seen it beforeMore of these types of movies should be made available instead of the current flicks about violence and immorality
Personally I can't stand Dora but my 4 year old niece loves her. So, if she's entertained (and quiet) when this is on I'm happy. I'm not sure of the educational value but my niece does pay attention and do the little movements and exercises. I'd recommend for the young kids.
I love this movie! The first time I saw it, I expected a decent horror film and was very disappointed with the lousy acting, terrible script and cheap special effects. My wife, however, opened my eyes to the comic brilliance of the film, particularly Jon Voight's hilarious performance of the Ahab-like poacher determined to capture a giant snake. I now see the movie in a completely different light. Everyone in the movie is awful! Voight's accent is a Brazilian/Cajun mess (I swear it changes from scene to scene!), Jennifer Lopez looks clueless, Ice Cube just grimaces the whole time and gives everyone dirty looks and Eric Stolz is just along for a paycheck. The snake looks like a cheap rubber novelty toy and the ending is so cliched it could've been written by a grade schooler. But thanks to the ineptitude of the cast and crew, Anaconda is one seriously funny movie. BUY IT!
As I said, this is the good stochastic manufacturing book. Even though the book is intended for graduate student, it's not too hard for undergrad at all. You can do more details -after reading Factory Physics- by using this book. I would give it more than 5 stars if Amazon have!
This is basically the same old router from D-Link. The DI-514...remember that piece of garbage?This does have the basics and some minor content filtering/parental controls but good parental control software would be a better and smarter choice if you need it.There is already a firmware update to fix WPA and Network settings issues. That is pathetic but common with D-Link equipment. I see it regularly. They release a new piece of junk, make the consumer suffer then release a firmware update to fix things. They seem to do this with almost every single router and firewall.This box runs hot too! The WiFi range is pathetic. I set it up outside with no obstacles and could barely get a decent signal at 50 feet. Any $30 Linksys WiFi Router will give you atleast 75 feet!THe worst thing of all about this router is that you cannot dedicate specific IP Addresses to specific computers. If you need to do remote access, use DynDNS, use P2P applications, etc you will regret not having this feature!Do not bother. Pass this piece of junk over. If you need a good budget WiFi router with excellent performance...get the Linksys WRT54G. You can find it in sale for $30-$45!!
Uh, I should have known just from the title that this book was going to be ridiculous. However, first off, l will tell you what was good about this book. The hero is a Spartan Warrior. Awesome! Remember Brad Pitt as Achilles in "Troy"? I have not come across a book in this genre before that has as its hero and as part of its plot Greek mythology. I'm sure they're there, I just have not come across any.Back to the point, Ms. Kenyon did not do the winning hero or the winning plot justice. I don't know if she plainly just isn't a good writer, or perhaps this was a bad item among her other and well written books. (I will do more research & read further from her, starting w/book 2 of this series.) When I was in high school, I thought myself a budding novelist and wrote these ridiculous, overly wordy (kind of like this review, eh?), fantastical and predictable stories. Fantasy Lover could have been one of mine from HIGH SCHOOL. The whole idea of Julian being this gigantic beefcake (he was totally described like Fabio & Fabio is so disgusting!) was just so over the top and ridiculous. Also, this book was printed in 2002 but there is barely any evidence within its pages of this fact. The only item dating it near the new millenium is the mention of "The Matrix". I believe this is a sign that Ms. Kenyon is out of touch with current/popular culture. Grace is 29, she a sex therapist, she owns her own house. But she is dowdy and sounds completely stuck in the early 90's. I appreciate authors like Sophie Kinsella who totally hit pop culture and relatively current fashion (but not TRENDY fashion) on the nose. Ms. Kenyon needs to do some research to get into the minds of conscientious young women. She could start by regularly reading young women periodicals, ie Glamour, In Style. I find it annoying when authors write about women my age who do not sound like any women I know. Any self-respecting 29 year old would drop dead before wearing their scrunchy in any other place other than the privacy of their own bathroom. And what was with the psycho patient? That whole part came completely out of nowhere and made no sense. The way it was thrown in the story completely stilted the flow.Ms. Kenyon does not accurately portray women of a certain age. Her plot lines are only superficially developed, leaving gaping holes and questions in the minds of attentive readers.
Recommended. Good acting, good story and quite chilling in parts. Best "spooky" movie I've seen in a while.
Okay, this is positively one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This movie is nothing but plotless nudity, violence, etc. etc. etc. Okay okay, maybe that's your thing. If so, then I suppose you'll love this movie. But after I got about half way through it, it dawned on me that nothing was going to happen but more of the same. I figured the good guys would end up winning out in the end and maybe the ending would be okay, but by the time I stopped the movie, I just didn't care and wanted to watch something else.Bottom line, if you love plotless movies, violence and nudity, go for it. But if you like a story with a plotline, stay away!
A very good read. Reasons I enjoyed it: The mystery of unwraveling the people in the picture; The reality of war; the redefinition of hero; and a son's finding his father.
I have a severe case of MCS (multiple chemical sensitivity) which is similar to an allergy, but biologically different, and so far, not treatable with drugs. Anyway, vapors and gases from countless plastics, pollution, electronics, newprints, etc. give me severe headaches, lasting hours. Sometimes smells in new things gas-off with time, but sometimes they don't. We took no chances. My wife and I bought several oil-filled heaters and returned them all immediately (They all seem to be made in China now,) because of the smells/vapors they gave-off. Then we got one of these Lakewood 5500.It is made in USA from "domestic and globally sourced parts" and did not bother me at all from day one. It is almost all metal. It pays to bargain hunt. We got ours for a fraction of some of the prices we've seen. I don't know if ours are "seconds," because there are many cosmetic imperfections on the paint and seams on the ones we got, but they work fine and noiseless on the 600W setting. We love them.
Final Destination has an interesting concept. Death hunts people who overcame his plan for them. A script originally written for X-Files, it is intelligent, cerebral, and witty. It is not your average "kill-teens" flick. Each teen has their own personality and you can actually tell the difference between all of them. You sympathize with the teens and hope they don't die; instead of rooting for the killer (in this case Death itself). The teens have actual intelligence and are not idiots. The cliffhanger ending is truly excellent.Among the Final Destination series, this is the best. Final Destination 2 (second best) suffered (in my opinion) from a relatively happy, hopeful ending compared to this cliffhanger ending; the new life concept seemed too hopeful. The Final Destination (third best) was relatively good but suffered from "show everybody die and not leave mystery" syndrome. Final Destination 3 suffered from stupid characters who no one cares about syndrome.
Love this fragrance! For day time in the office it's a bit too sweet. It's more for night time. Lovely!
I had been looking for this CD for a long time. I had it in cassette form but I wanted to switch over plus I just bought an Ipod so Im glad that I was able to find it. The music is has very good spiritual messages and upbeat. Also listen to this music while working out at the gym.
I'd give a logical and consistent argument for why I thought this was a poor quality book and unworthy of my money and time, but, since I paid for a logical and consistent argument from Ruggie and didn't get it, and this review is free, I feel under no such obligation. Ruggie's argument, and this is one of the biggest problems with multilateral liberalism, is limited to about a dozen countries, namely Western Europe, Canada, the US, and I suppose you can throw in Australia and New Zealand, and he isn't always consistent in dealing with this limited scope. For the other 180 countries, with the exception of Russia, Ruggie's argument has no power and his book says absolutely nothing. If that's what floats your book, read this book. If not, don't waste your time or money.
This book has everything I could ever want in a book: an engaging story, a shamanic quest, metaphysical speculation and Bill Murray. Golf as a martial art. Golf as integral practice for "the life beyond." This is the only golf book I've ever picked up that refers to Henry Corbin's "Spiritual Body and Celestial Earth," and Sufi/Orthodox/Catholic spiritual practices. Really a very enchanting story. Makes me want to take up golf and go muck about in Scotland. Highly recommended.
This is the album, unfortunately, that I try so very hard to forget came from Cam'ron - but, what's done is done. After hearing the first single off the record, &quot;Horse and Carriage,&quot; I wasn't too motivated to buy a copy, thinking that songs like that were what to expect from the CD. Despite my friends many arguments to look past the single because the album was &quot;blazin',&quot; I decided to borrow the CD and peep it. Not only was the record a waste of time, but I was enthused by the fact that Cam'ron was supposed to be an underground emcee, yet, the whole album was commercially drenched. The only joint I found worth listening to off the album was &quot;Wrong Ones,&quot; but other than that 'Confessions of Fire' is the epitome of the new style of music nodding heads -- hip-pop, and oh boy, is it wack.
Buffy's 4th Season was, until Season 6, the "scapegoat" season. That is, the year that everyone could bash on mercilessly without fear of retribution. Between Riley, the Initiative, and ADAM, there was enough for fans to hate. Of course, what it all boiled down to was that Riley wasn't Angel, and the Initiative and ADAM didn't work as well as the villains from Seasons 2 and 3 (possibly the best years of the show). Throw in lots of change (and not necessarily happy change, either), and you get a year everyone hates.However, Season 4 is still quite good.The early "college life" episodes ("The Freshman", "Living Conditions", and the Parker episodes) are excellent deconstructions of college life, and stand up to the best of the "high school life" episodes. The breaking up of the Scoobies works well, although the changes would lead to not-so-good things in the future.The biggest change (besides the loss of Cordy and Angel) is the addition of Spike. In this year, he's great, serving less of an ally as an enemy forced to help (which he only does grudgingly, at best). Later years would see Spike toe-ing the "Fonzie line" between key supporting character and character that takes over the show, though.Second is, of course, Willow's relationship with Tara (which begins at mid-season) and the revelation that Willow is, in fact, bisexual. (Things would also get ugly when the W/T relationship ended, but that's another story for another time.)Xander begins dating Anya, and while the "ignore Xander" plotline this year works, it'd eventually backfire when the writers began to happily ignore him. And, of course, Buffy ends up with Riley, the normal boyfriend who isn't really normal at all. Other than the maligned Riley, the new additions to the show fill the gap left by David Boreanaz and Charisma Carpenter (and then some).The problem, though, is that (as I've implied), the changes that work this year don't necessarily work in future seasons, causing a scapegoating effect on how Season 4 is viewed. (Especially given that the debates about the changes first seen here-debates about Spike, the Buffy/Spike relationship, the neglect of Xander, the shifting of Giles' role in Buffy's life, and the debate as to whether Willow is gay [as she vehemently states after this season on occasion] or bisexual [the answer seemingly backed up with the most evidence] will be fought for years to come.) However, given the quality of the individual episodes and elements of the overall plot, this is selling Season 4 extremely short.The special features are much more plentiful this time, with commentaries on the most pivotal episodes (including the first-ever appearance by a cast member on a commentary) and a number of featurettes to explore once you've finished watching the episodes themselves. Also of note is the message from Joss Whedon in regards to the fullscreen vs. widescreen debate over the DVD sets, which is hilarious (and sets the record straight that fullscreen Buffy is the way to go). All in all, an excellent release for Buffy fans casual and hardcore alike.
I like all three guys, and all three bands they are most famously known with. While the obvious climax of a documentary about three guitarists is a jam session, I think it's a mistake to head in that direction. I read here of guys who bemoan more music, less talk. I also read about how this was a poor combination of guitar players. While I may personally prefer a trifecta consisting of John McLaughlin, Lee Rinaldo, and Thor, the combo given in "It May Get Loud" made perfect sense to me. In a way, it's really the story of how Page's legacy splits into two directions generations later.How do I know this? It's on their faces when they get together, talk shop, and trade riffs. Jimmy Page's roots are in the Delta blues, which were born from Slave songs and prison work chants. Jack White talked about that same raw soul that one hears in Son House, which led to Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf. All Page's heroes as well. The Edge, from a Brian Eno era, seems removed from it all. Not in a bad way, but you can definitely see his blank expression when the other two go into it. But the Edge is basically a logical progression of Page's electronic experimentation with the echoplex, theramin, bowed guitar, leslie speakers and recording studio tricks. Jack White is the raw, soulful, bluesy side of Page's playing in Zeppelin and the Yardbirds. When White is banging away at his guitar, you can definitely see how much more Page digs it.The documentary tries to make this correlation, but not outwardly. I think it gives enough "scrapbook" moments from each guy and each band to keep everyone happy. For those cantankerous reviewers who grumble that there's not enough Jimmy Page and who in the world are those two other guys....careful....your age may be showing.Besides, for any true lover of Jimmy Page's playing, I can't see why they won't love the other two blokes.
While the high fidelity of modern Hans Zimmer scores or the like aren't here in range, these wonderful themes, usually done on the cheap, sound as sinister as they were when we were kids. Knowing that some exceptionally talented composers worked their youthful magic here makes them all the better. I've had this CD in my collection for a few years, and when I need that little drive down fantasy lane, nothing does the job like some sci fi, horror soundtrack to spice up a mundane drive.
If you like mariokart you will like this game. The differences in gameplay are miniscule. Great multiplayer fun. If you have ps2 though, you need a ps1 multitap. There are codes to unlock more battlemode stages. I like mariokart64 better but this is a more than adequete game.
So many wonderful things in this hymnal, but the Kindle version is a disappointment. It's difficult to navigate, and there's no music. If you want to savor the richness of this hymnal, get the hardcopy book not the Kindle version.
Brooke Valentine's CD has to be one of the best released this year. It's got infectious beats, great lyrics, and the perfect combination of energy-filled pop songs, crunk hip-hop tracks, and beautiful ballads. Chain Letter beats Beyonce, Alicia Keys, Missy, and all of the others. Here's an overview of the tracks.1. Girlfight - This song has an awesome beat. It's the first single, and all-around awesome. 10/102. Taste of Dis - The intro of this track is great. I love it. It's crunk for sure. 9/103. Long As You Come Home - I don't like this one as much. It's just okay. 5/104. Blah Blah Blah - This is my favorite song on the album. I love it. It's got an awesome beat, cool tune, and perfect lyrics. 100% great. 10/105. Cover Girl - Some people call this is filler track, but I think it's one of the best on the album. It's slow and beautiful, which is nice after all of the high-energy songs before it. 10/106. Playa - This song picks up the pace after Cover Girl. It's sexy and fun. 8/107. Ghetto Superstarz - One of the best tracks on the album. It's awesome. Single material for sure. 10/108. Tell Me Why (You Don't Love Me) - This one is catchy. It's really creative and cool. I like it. 8/109. Million Bucks - I don't love, but don't hate it either. It's alright. 7/1010. I Want You Dead - This is another one of my favorites. It's got an awesome beat and chorus. The lyrics are hilarious. 10/1011. Dying of a Broke Heart - Another beautiful ballad. It's really pretty, and has heart-felt lyrics. 10/1012. Pass Us By - Once again, don't love it, don't hate it. It's just sort of blah. 6/1013. Laugh Til' I Cry - Another ballad. Not as good as Dying of a Broke Heart or Cover Girl, but still pretty. 7/1014. American Girl - This song is 100% pop. It's really good, though. I love it. 10/1015. Watcha Lookin' At? - A perfect close to the album. It's catchy and fun. 8/10Overall, this is a great album for Beyonce or Alicia Keys fans. Brooke's got her own sound for sure. It's really cool how she blends all different kinds of music into one awesome album.
I found this book to be well-written and informative. It will be invaluable in combating the forces that want to put creationism, regardless of which flavor it is, in our school science classes. The only criticism I have to this edition is that the typing is inconsistent. Some lines wander a bit looking like the foot prints of a drunk staggering along the sidewalk. Character spacing varies and the type face is crude. It's almost as if the manuscript was typed on a mechanical typewriter badly in need of maintenance and then copied in toto.
This movie was recommended as one that would appeal to both men and women. Erotic, but not &quot;in-your-face&quot; like more hardcore movies. Unfortunately, this movie tried to be too many things to too many people and instead ended up failing at everything. At its heart is the marriage of a professional couple that lacks passion. The wife ends up in a lesbian affair with a pretty photographer. But things turn quite weird when the husband becomes involved. A bizarre love triangle is formed, and the movie goes from romantic to dramatic to just plain weird. I don't want to give too much of the movie away, but the plot twists can be seen a mile away. And to make matters worse, the ending is downright depressing (though by this time, any semblance of caring for the main characters has all but vanished).Don't waste your time with this one.
SAD MOVIE, BUT VERY IMFORMATIVE. LONLINESS. BEING A PRON STAR... YOU LOSE SEX AS A WAY TO CONNECT FEEL: LOVE,SECURITY,TRUST. NOT WORTH THE TRADE.
So many secondary characters abound in THE STOLEN BRIDE, the reader almost needs a score card to keep track. A sequel to THE STANFORD SECRETS, many of those characters return in this continuing regency saga. Warning: if you haven't read THE STANFORD SECRETS, you should do so before reading THE STOLEN BRIDE, as the author has many spoilers spread throughout the book.There's a reason why this book is so hard to find. It really isn't up to the author's usual standards, and I'm sure she would want to rewrite it before reprinting it again. While there was a plot of sorts, there wasn't much romance between the title character and her fiance. In fact, the book's biggest weakness is that we never really connect with Lady Sophie. We are given much more insight into one of the secondary characters, Beth Hawley, who is portrayed much better. THE STOLEN BRIDE isn't one of the author's best works, but then, it is one of her earliest efforts. If you never locate a copy, be satisfied with one of her more recent books, which are much better.
Strung Out is a huge name in the punk scene. These guys have been around for a long time now, and each time, they deliver album after album of solid punk tunes. They also feature one of the most talented drummers in the punk scene as well. Out of all their great discs, I'd say their best are "Twisted By Design" and the "Sonic Defiance" EP. Both those cds show the best of what Strung Out are able to do. Being a fan before this release, I can say I was egarly anticipating this one. When It came out, I snatched it up, put it into my player, and cranked up the volume.With "An American Paradox", Strung Out continues everything that they have been doing. Solid punk tunes with heavy guitar riffs, fast druming and throaty vocals. This is not really a bad thing, but more is a bit of a repetitive thing. There's not much variation in this release then in their others. If you were looking to see Strung Out enter a new direction with this cd, you'll be a bit disapointed, but if you like Strung Out just the way they are and never want them to change, you'll be sure to love this disc, as it is a good one.My favorite track would probably be "Lubricating the Revolution". This is Strung Out at their finest, its fast, its heavy and it has a very cool guitar solo in the middle. My other favorites are "Velvet Alley", "Alien Amplifier", "The Kids", "Unkoil", "Razor Sex" and the six minute ballad, "Cemetary". However, this is a Strung Out cd, and like all their others, its solid all the way through.While it isn't my favorite Strung Out cd, its another solid addition to thier name. If you are a fan of them, you probably have this already, but even if you aren't a fan, you should give a listen as well.
I was super disappointed to see the At the Drive In broke up, especially because I had tickets to see them in concert two weeks later. So when I saw that Sparta rose from the ashes, I was eager to hear what would materialize.Again, disappointment. This band sounds like ATDI if you take out all the piss and vinegar that made them rock so hard to begin with. The raw energy and intensity is gone here, and what is left is music that sounds uninspired and dry. There are a few good tracks here, but for the most part the album is just lacking punch. The version of "Mye" here I had originally heard on the Austere EP, and I liked it a bunch. But on this album the chorus is changed, and again, it lacks feeling after the change.Mars Volta, Sparta, neither one is At The Drive In quality, and it's sad because I really miss that band a ton.
I would consider consider myself a half-decent woodworker and have used the full Kreg system many times. This "field" version does the job just as well without all the benchtop set up. And if you are pocket holing long pieces of material, the Kreg benchtop system is awkward because you have 8 ft of wood going vertical. Not practical.Most of us woodworkers have great dexterity, and own a clamp or two, so using this jig pre or post assembly is a breeze.You won't regret buying it - it's worth it just for the new Kreg drill bit you needed!
Milla Edge's child was stolen when she and her husband did a medical stint in Mexico. She spent the next 10 years trying to find out about him while also becoming the founder of "Finders", a group who help find lost individuals all over the country. Her marriage breaks up because of her obsession with finding her child and she hears about a man named Diaz who may be connected to her child's disappearance. Diaz is an assassin who freelances for both governments and others who can afford him. They become involved and Milla discovers secrets which will dramatically change her life.
This is, at bottom, an attempt to work out a Marxist interpretation of Black-Scholes. Black-Scholes gets the numbers right, and so can't be written off as 'wrong' in any predictive sense.Yet it certainly wasn't the work of Marxists or anyone working from their premises, so for some one who is, the work must have been wrong in some sense.This is the situation Nasser Saber seeks to address. He does so with some ingenuity, but those of us who don't share the premises need not follow the windings of their application.Here's a very short course, though. He doesn't believe in "time preference," i.e. the idea that even aside from the interest of risk we prefer a dollar today to a dollar tomorrow, and have to be bribed to wait a day for our dollar. That bribe is known to mainstream economics as the risk-free interest rate, and it is crucial to the reasoning that led to Black-Scholes.Mr. Saber, though, treats interest rates as the arbitrary edict of banks, under the direction of a central bank. He claims that the mainstream theory would require is to believe that when "in 1998 and then again in early 1999, the Bank of Japan pushed the interest rates to zero, it did so because 120 million Japanese had lost their time preference."That's wrong, though, What such economists might say, rather, is that the Japanese continued to have a time preference, so there continued to be a risk-free interest rate, expressible in positive numbers, but that the Bank lent money at below this rate, at zero, in hopes of jump-starting a stalled economy. Gravity didn't disappear--the bank simply sought to create a hot air balloon to negate, if only briefly, its effects on certain masses.
$160 is an outrageous price for this book-someone needs to reprint it at an affordable price; it is an excellent account of a young woman's descent into mental illness. A young woman (in, I'd guess, the late 1950s) begins a job away from her family and starts hearing voices. The voices are those of some "operators," supernatural beings that secretly direct human beings' actions. In this world, she finds a protector who helps her stay one step ahead from the operators, who want to capture her and kill her. The journey goes across the country until her protectors send her to a psychiatrist. She winds up regaining her sanity and authoring this book. It's a shame that the book isn't available for people to read now.
Not one of my favorites. The first half was OK but the second half was disappointing. Disconjointed. Abrupt ending with no feeling.
A timeless blessing, Bessie Smith is one of the few artists (along with Dylan, Elvis, Aretha Franklin, the white album era Beatles) that deserves a Greil Marcus rave review, and Scorcese's selections are a wonderful intro. On the other hand, how could he go wrong?
We bought this Jumperoo for our then-4-month-old daughter about a year ago. At first she did not know what to think of it, sat in it and stared at us. By the time she was 6 months I could not tear her away from the thing! She is 15 months now (still under 25 pounds) and she STILL loves it. It's secure enough around her that she can't climb out of it, so she still uses it. She has used it and enjoyed it daily for well over a year! Can't say that about ANY other toy we purchased for her! We had a new baby this year who is now 4 months and we started to put her in it as well - I'm sure she'll enjoy it just as much! It folds up easily and can be moved from room-to-room with relative ease. Great battery life - in the one year we've had it I only recall changing the batteries once and the music plays daily. If this were full price I would STILL say it is worth every dime! It's been a lifesaver, especially that hour before bed when baby is cranky but it's just too early to put her in her crib.The only con: The paint on the toys does chip. I contacted Fisher Price and they said it's non-toxic but sent me new parts free of charge, so they have good service. Despite this, I still give it 5 stars!
When I read glowing reviews of this product it sends a shiver up my spine. I currently own or manage four Drobo devices and have had nothing but trouble. While the concept is amazing the execution would seem to be flawed.I had a Drobo Elite fail while it was hosting the virtual hard drives of several virtual machines. It brought everything to a standstill for over a week. I was finally able to rebuild my mail server VM on a different storage platform and got things running, albeit with the loss of several day's mail. After that point I called back to Drobo Support to ask why it should take weeks to rebuild after a single disk failure and they told me that it was because I continued using it. WTH? Why would someone buy a drive array if they had to shut down operations for a single disk failure. By the way, this Drobo was setup to be resilient against two drive failures. The loss in productivity during this outage easily eclipsed the price of the unit.Fortunately, I was able to buy an HP RAID out of that year's budget but before I could finish moving the data off of my Drobos the other elite failed a drive and it took about a month to recover from this one. I find it suspicious that the same WD Caviar Black, server grade drives as I use in my HP arrays fail so often in my Drobos. Anyhow, I was able to move essential data to more reliable equipment and relegated the Drobos to archival duty but they weren't even up to that task.I had another failure, supposedly a bad drive. This was the same unit that had taken roughly a month to recover and this time, after several weeks I was able to talk Drobo support into replacing the unit. As soon as I did that it was able to read the drives, including the one it claimed had failed.Of four Drobos I have had problems with three of them. The fourth unit has been used sparingly, basically an elaborate USB drive for moving data between locations without piping it over the WAN link.When I first bought these Drobos I was very happy with them. It seemed like a great product. The problem is, it hasn't been reliable in my case.
This is a stunningly awful movie. I went to see it when it first came out, and is one of only a handful of films that I walked out on. It's hard to believe the number of 4 and 5 star reviews of this film posted. This illustrates a problem with the reviews of DVDs on Amazon -- that basically only people that already like the movie are going to buy the DVD and review it. The movie was almost universally panned by critics, and flopped at the box office.
Why is everyone complaining about the cost??? A little shoe leather and effort and you can find the disc(season 2/part 1) at a store like Wal Mart for right around $20 bucks, plus tax! Sure it's more than season 1, but, you are getting each episode for less than $ 2. Two episodes basically cost you less than a horrible movie in the bargain bin. On the plus side, you're interested in this, so, paying a little more will help to keep the series alive on DVD for future releases. If all you do is complain and refuse to support the product, then we won't see the rest of the series. It amazes me how people will pluck down $ 20 for a brand new movie release on DVD, but, something like this you expect to get for free??? Let's look at the glass as half full, not half empty. Without support, we are going to continue to get every sitcom, cartoon and sci fi series ever made on TV-DVD, and much less of some of the quality westerns and dramas from the 50's, 60's & 70's.
BEYONCE....COME ON NOW. This cd is not what i expected at all. the style is not like the beyonce we know from dc or we've heard on '03 bonnie and clyde. I am dissappointed. The best song on the cd is Crazy in love. I had hoped it would have been better than this.
This is a charming look at two young men, basically looking for a place to have sex and being thwarted repeatedly. J.P. Pitoc and Christian Campbell are great leading actors, and performances by Tori Spelling and Coco Peru are perfect complements. What's sweet is the process in which the two men learn they like each other's company without the need to "trick" though still maintaining the sexual tension. The film made me miss New York a lot.
of shopping in a snooty, upscale Boutique and watching CSI.The main character, Helen has traded a lavish lifestyle to working in a clothing Boutique named Juliana's in Florida for minimum wage. The door always stays locked and is only opened for the rich and beautiful.Helen discovers that Christina (Juliana's Manager) has a special relationship with each customer. She refers the best plastic surgeons, knows how to immigrant housekeepers and the perfect hit man.Things turn sour when Christina is found floating in a barrel in the bay. Her customers are mournful, but more desperate to retrieve their secrets that Christina was holding. It's up to Helen to solve the mystery.I knew that this would be a great read when I saw that Jane Heller called this book, &quot;Irrestible, a heroin with a sense of humor and a gift for snappy dialogue&quot; since Heller is one of my favorite authors.If you like Heller's collection, you will love Shop till You Drop.
I have a 1975 Schwinn Continental bike. Yes, old school. However, compared to bikes being sold today; not far off the competition. So instead of replacing the bike, I decided to replace the tires and tubes. The original tires on this bike were Kenda 27" x 1-1/4" tires. I up-sized to the 27" x 1-3/8" tires and tubes with the hope of getting a little softer ride now that I'm 35 years older than when I bought the bike. The old Kenda tires (exactly the same composition of the new tires) never dry-rotted. One did develop a flat spot from sitting so long (and hence why I replaced them).I had no problems with fit, it does provide a slightly softer ride, and without any noticeable difference in tire size to the eye. The front tire change couldn't have been easier and faster. Of course, as with any bike, the rear took longer to deal with the chain and the rear wheel gear sprocket; still reasonably easy. Neither front nor back tire change required brake removal if you deflate the tires before removing the rim.Just a quick plug for the old 1975 Schwinn Continental; the gears are still as smooth as silk and the ride is pretty nice.
Moberly espouses studies and treatments that have been totally disavowed by every reputable organization from the American Pychiatric Association on down. She employs the old trick of quoting others out of context in order to support her practices. These &quot;treatments,&quot; to me, are akin to the practice of taking a person who is left-handed and tying that hand down so that the individual may learn to be a &quot;normal&quot; right-handed person.
I haven't even finished the book, but I already am enjoying Jeff Cohen's "leading man"! And when I read about his autistic son, I feel like I'm reading about my own home life! My son has Asperger's/PDD and everything the character describes about his son is right on the money! In fact, it made me feel better about my own kid's meltdowns, disappearing after school to the computer, picky eating, etc. He's living my life! And the fact that I'm as dry-humored as Aaron makes me settle right into this book as if it were written about my own family. Keep 'em coming, Jeff!

I've had this phone for a couple of years at least and the batteries are terrible. I've replaced them twice and just leave it on the charger all the time now.
Back in the mid/late 80s, an OAV anime by title of "Bubblegum Crisis" (which I think is a military slang term for when technical equipment goes haywire) made its debut on video, taking inspiration from "Blade Runner", "The Terminator" and maybe even "Robocop", with a little dash of Batman/Bruce Wayne - Iron Man/Tony Stark and Charlie's Angel's girl power thrown in for good measure. 8 episodes long, the overall story was that in 21st century Tokyo, Japan, year 2032-2033, living machines called Boomers were doing manual labor and sometimes cause problems. A special, SWAT like branch of law enforcers, the Advanced Police (AD Police for short) were formed to handle the boomers, but were mostly ineffective, prompting millionaire scientist Sylia Stingray, the daughter of the scientist who made the boomers, to create four powered combat armor (hard suits) to be worn by women to fight the boomers and fight the evil corporation that produced the boomers, GENOM. That group becomes known as the Knight Sabers, and in addition to ring leader Sylia, her rag-tag band of rebel women included Priss Asagiri, a struggling rock and roll gal with a passion for motorcycles and a disdain for cops, Linna Yamazaki, an aerobics instructor with an eye for money and a tendency to blow through boyfriends, and Nene Romanova, a young officer of the ADP and expert computer hacker (the first in a long line). GENOM, meanwhile, is represented by Quincy, a tall, gaunt old guy who happens to own the company, his younger assistant Brian J. Mason (killed in episode 3) and an annoying boomer man named Largo. Other characters included Leon McNichol and Daley Wong, two AD Police detectives (Leon appeared in a spin-off/prequel anime, "AD Police Files" which I heard was very dark), their balding, overweight boss Chief Todo, Sylia's younger brother Mackey, and a funny little mechanic known as Dr. Raven, who apparently helps Sylia with maintaining the suits. Aside from the overall Knight Sabers & AD Police VS GENOM storyline, there was also another storyline involving a friend of Linna's who was apparently a daughter in a big crime family, the annoying Largo trying to usurp GENOM, and various Priss-wants-revenge-for-a-minor-character story. Oh and did I mention that there were hints that Sylia herself might have been a boomer?Well, it was a great watch, full of chaos and mayhem and even some very nice pop songs, but it was not without its flaws, some of which, unfortunately, were due to the fact that the series was discontinued after episode 8 when it was originally planned for 13 episodes in all. So some of the storylines, like Largo's scheme (or schemes), the family of Linna's ill-fated friend, and Sylia's origins, were never resolved. Another problem with the series was that at the time Priss was the most popular character, so a good portion of the series focused on her, and unfortunately, most of the Priss oriented episodes basically focused on Priss self-righteously seeking justice/revenge for some secondary character who had never appeared before but happened to be a friend of hers, yet she rarely went out of her way for her the Knight Sabers, who were always bailing her out of trouble and for some reason cared a great deal about her well-being (just to be fair though, she did go to rescue Linna in episode 7, and her boyfriend got killed by a boomer and the ADP acted wrongly in the investigation). This meant we didn't really get to focus on the more interesting back story of Sylia, or even the day-to-day antics of Nene and Linna. Linna had two episodes oriented around her, which pertained to her friend with the mafia family, while Nene managed to snag the last episode for herself, which showed her eternal good cheer was genuinely good spirits and not ditziness. Nene also got to put her computer skills to good use quite a bit, or she sometimes just acted like a lovable goof, which put her screen time and character development a few notches above poor Linna, who was often thrust into the background with only her greed and her tendency to eat up boyfriends to get her any attention. Don't get me wrong, I like it and I love the overall concept of it all, but it did irk me a little bit. Also this is one of those runner-ups for "worst English voice dubbing of all time" features, meaning you'd better stick to the Japanese. Some of the voices were okay (some really did match their characters personas) but others were just flat and passionless or, in the case of Priss, really overacted.Well, Tokyo 2040 comes along and pretty much tosses all that out the window. Set a few years ahead, the story here is that after earthquakes shattered Tokyo, GENOM's boomers rebuilt the city into a big old paradise, except the boomers still have a tendency to fly off the handle, which prompts the AD Police to be formed followed by the Knight Sabers being formed. So the overall story is the same, but the backstories of the characters and the look and attitudes of the characters have changed a lot.1) Originally Sylia had short purplish black hair and brown eyes, was usually dressed like a stern, proper business woman and was distant from others. 2040 Sylia has more of a super-model look to her, dressing more provocatively and possessing white hair and blue eyes that seem to change color depending on the light (runs the gamut from blue to purple to silver and eyes occasionally looking purple or gray), and also 2040 Sylia is more of an emotionally unstable woman who flies off the handle when she's not in public, and possibly keeps even more secrets than before. Sylia also doesn't take as much risk on the battlefield, as she is more of a stay-in-the-mobile-pit type here, but she does do battle when she has to.2) Originally Priss was a short woman with an Afro and a really bad temper, always picking fights with people who offended her, always biting off more than she could chew, etc. 2040 Priss, however, has gone the way of the Clint Eastwood loner - very cold, very stoic and emotionally distant (more like the original Sylia you might say), so she's not really attached to anyone. Also her hair is more stingry and cat-like (a big improvement) and she is clad in leather like Trinity from "The Matrix" (although much less annoying than before, unfortunately, the writers screw her in the end when revealing her reasons for hating the ADP).3) Originally Linna had this big black hair going for her, but now her hair is shorter, browner, and, well, more 90s like. 2040 Linna is also an office lady who has bad luck with being sexually harrassed. As if to apologize for the way she was treated by the OAV writers, the 2040 writers actually dedicated the first 6 episodes to Linna, writing her as a country girl new to the city but determined to meet the Knight Sabers and win a spot with them, which she eventually does.4) Originally a short red haired girl who was often the victim of ridicule and ate a lot of candy, Nene is now a short blonde haired girl who likes to tease and take pot shots at ADP detective Leon McNichol (revenge for him toying with her in the OAV?) and other characters, even her surrogate big sister Linna and Mackey, Sylia's "brother", whom she becomes infatuated with. Cockey and arrogant, she still eats a lot of candy and is a master hacker, but she is eventually deflated and grows beyond her comic relief status.5) Nigel Kirkland is a new character, a tall, stoic, ruggedly handsome man with long black hair (he looks like Adrian Paul from TV's Highlander), he replaces Dr. Raven from the old series and now serves as the man who gives maitenance to Sylia's hard suits. Nigel is also Sylia's lover, but you wouldn't know it by his demeanor. He's kind of the father/big brother/mentor figure to Mackey.6) Leon and Daley are back, but of course differently. The original Leon was a tall pretty boy built like a baseball player with slicked back brown hair, blue eyes, a black leather jacket, tight blue jeans, and always carrying a revolver that could magically pack more whallop than a howitzer if necessary; while he wasn't really a bad guy deep down, he was kind of a jerk, but he served mostly as comic relief, as he tried to pursue Priss romantically (exactly what he saw in her is a mystery) but occasionally he and Daley served as information guides to important plot points. Also the original Daley was a fairly muscular red head who dressed in pink/purple suits as he was a flamboyantly homosexual character who was always hitting on Leon when not providing important information. In 2040, Leon is no longer a pretty boy but more your typical rugged tough guy type, with spiked black hair, brown eyes, tall and sporting big muscles, a brown leather jacket and blue dockers (he actually looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger a little bit, or maybe a pumped up Colin Farrell, or Hugh Jackman), and he still carries a revolver, a BIG one, but it's not as powerful as before. Although 2040 Leon still has a bit of an attitude probelm (especially in approaching Priss), he's not nearly as much of a jerk as he was in the old series, but he does have a bad temper and he is easily annoyed by Nene and Daley (also he drinks way too much coffee). Oh, and Leon is still after Priss, but he has a lot more luck this time around. Daley, meanwhile, is now a taller (but not as tall as Leon) more pretty boyish looking guy with red rimmed glasses, a white suit, green eyes, and light brown hair, and he carries a big machine gun (he actually looks like James Marsden from the X-Men films); Daley is a lot smarter and more assertive in 2040 than the OAV and, although it's not completely clear, his homosexual tendencies have been almost totally disappeared, save a moment of what appears to be jealousy when he hears about Leon inquiring about Priss's e-mail.7) Brian J. Mason (what does that "J" stand for?) is back, and so is Quincy, but Mason is much more the main villain here, with Quincy as co-villain, as he is no longer a towering figure of terror but a vegetable with a bunch of batteries and wires plugged into him. Mason now sports slicked back brown hair instead of black hair as he did in the OAV (he actually looks like OAV Leon in a suit) and he is very much from the Alan Rickman school of villains.8) Though a pervert in the first series, Mackey is no longer a pervert in 2040. Of course, there are lots of things different about Mackey in 2040, but they won't be revealed here.9) Sylia now has a companion, an Alfred-the-butler type named Henderson, who worries about her and the gang.10) In the original series, boomers were like the Replicants in "Blade Runner", armed with their own thoughts and feelings and ambitions, but in 2040, they're more of the dumb-monsters-on-the-rampage type. Most of the time they're just big robots who do whatever they're programmed to do (heavy labor, combat, clean up, etc) and they have this tendency to "go rogue", which means try to evolve and become a monster in the process.What does stay the same is the theme of humanity VS technology (do machines have souls?). Sadly, this series, though well animated and well written, only runs 26 episodes, so it moves by faster than one might like, especially those of us who are used to more than one season of our most beloved characters, and unfortunately it still ends on a cliff hanger with unresolved storyline bits (which I will not discuss here. What saves this show and makes it what it is, however, is the characters, a colorful cast of screwballs they are, ranging from stoic loners, psycho women, genocidal mad men, rough neck cops, sardonic intellectuals, wise old sages, and loveable innocents, much more diverse than before and with a lot more to play off of, they're enough to make you wish this show had gone longer.It's not great, but it's a good watch. Also the English dub (by ADV) is quite good, though not without a few flat spots, but certainly better than the dub on the original.
This is one of those books you can classify as 'no nonsense'. I was browsing the bookstore to look up an IS-IS problem and just happened to pick up this book and to my astonishment it had 45 pages of IS-IS config and troubleshooting, diagrams, IOS output and what not. I just had to get my hands on this book.The book starts from the basics of IP routing with cisco IOS in mind, even tell you about 'routed' vs 'routing' protocols! The protocol coverage starts from RIP then moving on to IGRP, EIGRP, OSPF, IS-IS and BGP. It has an entire chapters on Static and default routing, Redistributing routes, DDR. Appendix has a nice brief discussion of access lists, VLANs, NAT and HSSRP.If you deal with cisco routers, you got to have this book. Specially the beginners can get a lot from the text coz it not only covers the config issues but also the theory behind various routing protocols.All in all, a pleasant book to own and benefit from. And yes I did find solution to my IS-IS problem in the book.
I have not seen "The Electric Company" since I was around five years old. I'm now 28, but the show is really hypnotic. It's no wonder I could read before kindergarten - between my mom reading to me nightly and the daily dose of "The Electric Company." The odd thing too is, despite being aimed at children, I didn't feel dumb watching this. Maybe it's because I WAS the right age for something like this. :) Shout! Factory as always has taken something and given it the high-class treatment. Now if only they'd do a "Best Of" DVD of the early Sesame Streets to see again...Most interesting for me to see: Not only was Morgan Freeman one of the most visible stars of this series... but I was not aware that the familiar "We're gonna turn it on" theme was NOT used for every season. And I love that they kept the old PBS logos. Well Done.
Intially, I didn't like this book, but the more I learned in school, the more I can appreciate this book. It gives complete instructions on ortho testing. Includes all active, passive, resisted ROM's and many special test. Couldn't give this book 5 stars because too many special test are not included, but the exams for the joints are very involved. It is detailed and gives very thorough explanations and directions on testing every joint in the body. It starts with the cervical and works down to the phalanges. There's a section that describes conditions and abnormalites, and what symptoms the affected client/patient will most likely present with. There's a section on gait analysis. There's a section on common trigger point locations and referral patterns, broken down by specific structures. Much easier to locate than on Travell's chart. This books gives more than enough information for a Massage Therapist with a clinical modality. This book will help you be well prepared to work in any hospital or clinical setting as a Therapist. This is not a book for spa or relaxation wellness massages, unless you incorporate some clinical work into your spa massage.I purchased this book used for very little money. Not sure, but I think the only difference in the newest edition is a chapter on TMJ disorders.
I liked this movie. Beautifully done and a good peek intothe French resistance. Kept me interested and a moving 'true' story.
Looks like a great product, right? Think again.The brush head does &quot;pulsate&quot; rapidly, but you can get the same sensation and cleaning by properly brushing. Not that most peopel spend 10 minutes on brushing, but to use this is a whole oredeal. It takes much longer to clean than your regular toothbrush. And G-d forbid you shoudl need a replacement head, what a hassle to attach.Reach for a regular toothbrush and save your cash.
Cannie Shapiro is 28 and works as a journalist. Her ex starts a job at a magazine and he writes a story about loving a fat girl - her. Cannie is not sure how to react, but then finds herself pregnant with his child, kicked out of a weight loss drug study with a doctor who likes her and suddenly the best friend of a movie star who sells Cannie's screenplay to Hollywood -throwing Cannie into the limelight. In the end, Cannie gets the doctor, accepts her fat self, has the baby (after serious complications) and finally gets over Bruce, taking his job in the process.The whole pregnancy story was nuts - why did she have to have his baby to get over Bruce? And then she is thin? Come on. Why does her mother have to be a lesbian and the new girlfriend a cause of the premature birth? Couldn't Cannie have had less drama - especially the hysterectomy - and end up in the same place? Did she have to sell a screenplay,get a movie star who redoes her house and end up with a doctor? This was just too over-the-top.
I agree with the reader from Oakland. This book... is much too expensive. The book is about 260 pages long but there aren't any photos of natural hairstyles until page 185! The first 2/3 of the book is a manual for cosmetologists on how to care for a clients natural hair. Since I have most of the other popular books on natural haircare (Pam Ferrel, Tulani Kinard, Bonner, etc) I already know most of this information. Except for a special 8 page section at the end of the book, all the photos are in black and white. This is fine but some of the photos are instructional and it's very difficult to see how the styles are made. The section on locks styles (palm rolling, etc) is very very short and not very good. For example there is only one small photo that shows how to palm roll and since it's not in color you can't see it. This is the biggest problem with the book. The short chapter on flat twists is a failure. The photos are lovely but there is not photo instruction and the author tries to explain how to achieve the style in 3 sentences. That's it. If you are a person that frequently buys black hairstyling magazines, I guarantee that you've seen ALL of the photos in this book. They are used frequently in hairstyle magazines. If you are beautician who isn't familiar with natural african hair, you will find this book useful but for women with natural hair who are looking for new styles, I would buy LETS TALK HAIR instead.
This books makes a weak attempt to jump on the money wagon of Left Behind. It fails miserably in several ways. First, the plot has nothing to do with anything in the bible. If you enjoyed Left Behind, this book will only annoy you. The plot wanders around making the reader think it might pick up and get interesting. It doesn't.Technical parts of the plot are annoying as well. For example, an ohm meter is used to check voltage on a fence. The author needs to get his basic electrical concepts straight before writing stuff like this. Other science in the book is similar, with vague references to data that really mean nothing or are simply wrong.Overall, the book reads like it is the author's first attempt at writing a novel. Some characters are good, but the plot development and foundation is so weak the characters can't succeed in salvaging it.
I must agree with another commentator about giving this album "some time." I am a HUGE Ely fan, and fell in love with here when I heard her previous album LOTOFIRE, which I still consider her best. When I first heard this new production I hated it, but found that some of the songs lingered in my head... So I decided to listen to it more, and now have grown to appreciate what Ely has done.What can I say? As with Julieta Venegas, love does things to songwriters, afterall, they are human beings people! Change and happiness isn't necessarily downfall however...This album is bouncy and playful, and Ely fluctutates, within the same song, with coos and yells. However, it is delicately orchestrated to be this way, and the result is good. It is something different, definitely experimental, and with more rock and pop sounds than her previous work.I gave it four stars because of two reasons. She does one English song that is quite shockingly HORRIBLE(ANGELITO HEART(?)) and ruins the mood of the album, since it is in the middle. Another problem is the never ending cooing...it sounds great at first, but she does it in EVERY song and it gets a little old.Overall, I do recommend the album. You can tell that Ely has found a large part of herself, though is still in the process of COMPLETELY finding herself. She seems to be experimenting lots with her music- all of her albums are very different.
I enjoyed this a great deal--especially the scenes of how the young daughter dealt with her traditionalist mother--because it treats a lot of themes central to the question of leaving traditions behind, modernization, etc. However, beware that--for feminists and those who actually know something about Pakistanis--many stereotypes, especially gender stereotypes, are heavily cultivated in the book. In short, as someone who knew nothing about the actual subject matter I loved the STORY--but I suspect that Muslims or Pakistanis might have reason to be offended.
I received lots of compliments. These look great with white as well as pastel colored cuffed shirts. Very elegant in appearance. Though, they seem a bit delicate and are smaller in size than I expected.
Having gone through and reread this series again, I am once again reminded of how much I have enjoyed Terry Brook's Word and the Void series.It was great to see what became of Bennit from the first book, even though it then becomes a tragic ending too for her.The story moves at a good clip despite the real action only happening at the end, but when it comes, it there. Some feel it was over too quickly, I thought it was just fine given the circumstance for Nest and Ross to go in, confront their enemies, hit them fast and hit them hard given the overwhelming odds they had with Findo Gask, Penny, Twitch and the ur'droch.Overall, this was a great conclusion to the series and if Brook should ever choose to write more, I'd be on board to read more.
What can I say? First words that come to mind are HOLY *beep* *beep*! Best comedy EVER! It's even better than Troll 2! It's absolutely hilarious! Absolutely everything in the movie is hilarious! Johnny (of course), his always expressionless face, his always expressionless voice, his accent, his laughs, his personality, the dialogue (absolutely hilarious), the absolutely horrible dubbing, the sex scenes, the music in the sex scenes, the friends who like to come to Johnny's appartment in the middle of the day to have sex, how Lisa's mom always come to the appartment for only 3 minutes, how Denny likes to watch Johnny and Lisa having sex, how everyone calls Lisa beautiful or sexy when she's average looking at best, how some characters appear once and we never see them again, how some scenes are supposed to be dramatic and they end up being hilarious, the "football" scenes, etc... etc... etc... Tommy Wiseau is a genius! The problem is that it happened by mistake.Best lines (Spoilers, of course, but I'm sure that reading them will make you want to see the movie as soon as possible!):Johnny: You are lying! I never hit you! YOU ARE TEARING ME APART, Lisa!Johnny: I did not hit her, it's not true! It's bull*beep*! I did not hit her! I did naaat. Oh hi, Mark.Johnny: Don't touch me maatherfaackuur.Johnny: You not good, you just a chicken cheep cheep cheep cheep cheeeeep!Johnny: Hi, doggy!Johnny: I'd do anything for my guuurrl!Johnny: That's the idea (he says it like 10 times).Mark: How was work today?Johnny: Oh pretty good. We got a new client... at the bank. We make a lot of money.Mark: What client?Johnny: I can not tell you, its confidential.Mark: Oh come on. Why not?Johnny: No I can't. Anyway, how is your sex life?Claudette: Well, the results came back - I definitely have breast cancer.Lisa: Don't worry about it.Mark: Leave your stupid comments in your pocket!Johnny: I'm tired, I'm wasted, I love you darling.Mark: I used to know a girl, she had a dozen guys. One of them found out about it... beat her up so bad she ended up at a hospital on Guerrero Street.Johnny: Ha ha ha. What a story, Mark.Johnny: Hey everybody, I have an announcement to make. We're expecting!Everybody: ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Period.Johnny: Everybody betrayed me! I fed up with this world!Mark: As far as I'm concerned, you can drop off the Earth. That's a promise.Lisa: I just wanted to hear your sexy voice. I keep thinking about your strong hands around my body. It excites me so much.Mike: Chocolate is a symbol of love.The entire flower shop scene:Johnny: Hi!ffs: Can I help you?Johnny: Yeah, can I have a dozen red roses, please?ffs: Oh hi, Johnny, I didn't know it was you.10 seconds later...Johnny: That's me!Johnny: How much is it? (his lips don't move)ffs: It will be 18 dollars.Johnny gives the money even before she ends the sentence...Johnny: Here you go. Keep the change.Johnny looks at a dog...Johnny: Hi, doggie.ffs: You're my favorite customer.Johnny: Thanks a lot. Bye.You have to see it to believe it!
I have to say that The Ref has become one of my Christmas favorites over the years. How weird is this, that a profane movie like this could become a holiday classic? Maybe it has something to do with a smart and funny screenplay by Richard LaGravanese (The Mirror Has Two Faces, Living Out Loud) and Marie Weiss. Obvious physical humor is supported by a hysterical cleverness throughout the film, which also benefits greatly from inspired performances. Denis Leary is terrific as Gus, the robber/kidnapper, and Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey are his perfect foils. One of the funniest moments in the film is Santa, getting kicked out of the house, by the upset parents. His 3-second monologue is a classic. All in all, a wonderful movie, teriffically written, crisply directed (Ted Demme, we'll miss you), and well acted. Watch it with a group of your friends, and you will die laughing at this Holiday Classic.
This toy was a gift for my youngest on her first birthday. And she loves it....but so does my three year old! The two of them sit together at the fridge, switching out the magnets and singing the cute songs together. It's a fabulous toy and the volume control is much appreciated bonus feature for this mom. My kids and I would recommend this toy!
It's darn near perfect! Top quality and design at an affordable price. Worth every penny we paid. After 10 months of abuse it still looks almost like new and nothing has broken. We got it when he was 3 years old and now he's 4. He uses it every day. This toy is SAFE, DURABLE and FUN! It's the most popular toy on the block. As he gets olderr, we can move the seat to make it bigger for him. I expect he'll be enjoying this peddle car for many, many years to come.
OK, this is an animated, rather silly little movie, but it is well done and the 3D effect is impressive. It should appeal to pre-teens and the older generation, if for no other reason than it is funny and absorbing.There are moral values incorporated, but they do not interfere with the story.
My daughter got this for her 9th birthday because she wanted to learn how to knit. It is a great starter set, with LOTS of yarn, long wooden needles & a cute carrying basket. My only complaint is that even after reading the instructions several times, neither of us understood or could get it to work. We may have to look somewhere else for more simple instructions. We've had the set for almost 6 months, and so far, nothing has been knitted!
If you like the kind of movie in which you never know what is coming next then this is your movie.If I would tell you what is about, I will have to tell you the whole movie because everything is so important to be able to understand the plot.Believe, you will not be dissapointed, this is a great movie.
unfortunately when i switch between the different light settings on the 3-way bulb it shorts out my apartment. really annoying. now i just have it controlled by a light switch, and only ever use it on one brightness setting. :-(
Where to begin? How horribly can a concept be systematically destroyed?This movie came out in 1978 or 1980, depending on where you look (the case says '80, but online sources say '78). Either way, the special effects are straight out of the 1940's. There are low budgets, and there are no budgets. Didn't these guys learn ANYTHING from Star Wars, 2001: A Space Odyssey, or other 60's-70's sci-fi? Even with a barely-there budget things could have been much better.But let's get to the real appeal of this movie, the schlocky sex and the promise of our heroine getting "yet another graphic ravaging by a hugely-endowed man-beast." Total letdown. As a huge fan of the crazy, I-can't-believe-they-actually-did-that, full-frontal of the creature, semen-soaked monster scenes from The Beast (La bte), this promise of a follow-up fell completely flat. Our "hugely-endowed man-beast" is a bearded old man with hooved faun's legs. The faun statue in the dining hall was more erotic.There's no "equipment" on display, even in this unrated version, so you get no creature eye candy as you definitely did in The Beast. All you get is some above and to-the-side views of him doing her missionary style. Oh, and the furry legs are very, very obviously nylons with some thin, curly fur stuck on. What a total letdown. I just noticed there is an X-rated version offered. I don't know if that one is any more graphic but (1) I'm not going to pay again to find out and (2) our bearded old "man-beast" is hardly sexy anyway, so seeing more of his equipment wouldn't do anything for me anyway.I could also go on and on about the terrible plot holes and the totally baffling horse mating scene. How did horses get on this far-off, unexplored planet? The scene is shown in a grainy, funhouse mirror effect that I assume is meant to invoke a mysterious atmosphere, but completely fails. And did we really need a blatant ripoff of light sabers while they were fighting the amazingly incompetent robot guards?If you're hoping for anything like The Beast (La bte), prepare to be utterly disappointed. If you're simply expecting a cheesy, sexy bad-but-fun B movie diversion, you'll still be disappointed. This was just awful in every respect.
Just completed the series and loved it. Fell in love with the characters, loved Jason Behr. Everyone on this show was great. They should pick up where they left off and write a few more seasons.
Parker does seem to be a little thinner on plot as of late, and some the lines are definitely recycled... But it has the feel of that ol pair of shoes. Familiar, comfortable perfect for a lazy sunday afternoon... Kinda sad I couln't pay 9.99 for, that was a big selling point on the Kindle.
This "Fully interactive fun" pop-up book started coming apart on the first use by my not-rough-at-all 2 yr old (it was a bday gift). Now, 2 months later, it's ready for the trash. I seem to recall that the pop-up books from my childhood lasted a lot longer than 2 months. And for all the rhyming with animals, there was no 'see you later, alligator' or 'after a while, crocodile' or 'wait and see, chickadee'. This is not worth the money, even free.
For the past few years I have been searching for numerous of shampoos that can clean my greasy hair. After lots of trials, I finally discovered a method how to keep my hair clean for 2 days without looking like I dipped my head into deep fryer. For each wash, I alternate between 5-6 different brands and continually add or subtract different products every few months. Suave has proven to effectively clean my hair and leave no residue behind. It even washes out the dry shampoo I use in my hair to keep the grease at bay on days I don't have time to wash. For the price I paid, only 1.99, was well worth it and will be keep this as part of the haircare regimen I created.
Insightful story about personal struggles, pain and suffering, and giving up control of your life to God. This author consistently impresses me with his ability to write realistic characters and give the reader opportunity to get to know them well.

This started out being a good toy for outside, but the first throw by our front yard tree, and there was a big rip in the hover disc. I was hoping that it would last more then 3 minutes! :(
As there are plenty of reviews describing the content (which is amazing) the purpose of this review is (obviously) not to duplicate those efforts, but to warn and advise about the quality (or lack thereof) of many of the editions recently put out, including the one that I got.Several recommendations: If you are not already familiar with T.E. Lawrence, first read the recent biography "Hero: The Life and Legend.." by Michael Korda. That will initiate the reader into Lawrence's world, and that book is well published and edited, and contains several maps and a good number of photographs. From "Hero" you will learn just how much effort Lawrence put into the writing of his story of the Arab Revolt of 1916-1918, including plans for very limited publishing and exacting standards of paper type, maps included, etc.The above recommedation is critical if you are reading reviews to decide about purchasing one of the very sub-par recent editions of Lawrence's own publication "Seven Pillars of Wisdom." As stated in many of these reviews (check out the 1-star reviews), there are many horrible, terrible, very bad editions of "Seven Pillars," by which Lawrence would be understandably outraged. The edition I got is one example: paperback ISBN 978-1-61720-183-7, 2011 Wilder Publications, 548 pages. I think the publisher says that it is "green" and only prints the book as it is ordered, and as the date on the back page of mine says 03 November 2011, that seems likely. What a crying shame that the 'green' publisher could not also take the time to correct all of the obvious typos - the vast majority of which seem to be errors from scanned material that was not correctly OCR-d and proofed.That being said, if you have read "Hero" you need to decide how bothered you will be by mistakes in the book as you read. If you can be tolerent then you don't have to be choosy about the publisher/edition you get, because even with the horrible one, you will have the background to be able to overlook the errors (I tried pretending that the mistakes made it more like reading the original notes, rather than the written, revised, lost, rewritten, agonized over and carefully published manuscript that it was.)If you know that you will be interested and you like to keep books that you care about, you will want to track down better editions - maybe online will not be the best way to shop for it since there are so many.
If you are familiar with Kurt Adler Fabriche Santas then you know this is a quality item. This particular Santa comes in a nice, but different, box, as it appears to have been a product designed for Lionel. As with all the Fabriche Santas, I believe you get your money's worth. Also, as with many of these Santas, you will proably appreciate it more if you are a train fan. I bought this for someone who use to work on trains - and they loved it. I should note also then when I bought the Santa, it was still offered by Amazon. I notice that now they are limited or only available from other merchants.
Everything about this release is wrong, except for the content. Maybe if the sound was recompressed, remixed and washed out a couple of times it might be tolerable. It seems most of The Who's punch from "Live at Leeds" was lost in the open air of this festival. I've heard better bootlegs, but not to say that this recording is "dirty", because it's not. If anything is too quiet, clean and tired. I'd pass.
I've read many books on Negotiation, and use negotition actively and intensly in my day to day worklife.No book that I have read has given me more tangible & real life advice than this book. The authors, Fisher, Ury (& Patton for 2nd Ed), have done a supurb job at keeping the process of negotiation both simple & thorough.If you don't like conflict, but don't want to be pushed over by the more aggressive and experienced negotiator...then this book is an absolute must.
Dr. Lasker was a great world champion in his time, but that doesn't say that he was a good teacher as well (Dr. Tarrash on the other hand, wasn't a world champion, but he was a great tutor). Lasker's "Common sense in Chess" suffers from a serious weaknesses. The first one is Lasker's type of player. He was a "practical" player more than a theory creator. That helped him, I guess, to keep the title for more than 20 years, but didn't help him to explain in this book the thoughts behind the ideas, to show us how to observe complicated positions, and to understand the game better, like Tarrash did. Second weakness of the book is its age: It was written in 1895. Being an old book doesn't mean that it must be a bad one, but in this case it does. Short time after the book was released, theory revolution started by the "hyper modern" masters - Nimzovich, Reti, Alekhine, Breyer etc. Reti, in his classic "Modern ideas in Chess", demonstrates very well how the old Steinitz school masters, including Lasker, failed to understand the new ideas of the young masters. This revolution, that is represented well by Nimzovich and Reti, and is agreed to be the basic foundation of the modern Chess, is not in this book. So besides a limited historical value, this book had lost its importance years ago, unlike "My system", for example.
The title is misleading... this is a work far beyond criminal history. It is comprehensive history and philosophical work... it is Colin Wilson at his best... and as always difficult to find but easy to read.
Let me begin by saying that there are 26 tracks on this disc (not 12 as indicated in the Amazon track listing) and that these 26 present Red Nichols dixie-inspired big band in a most favourable light. Clearly the succes Bob Crosby was enjoying with his dixieland big band offerings inspired others to follow suit: Tommy Dorsey, Will Bradley, Glenn Miller, Jimmy Dorsey all served a healthy portion of strongly dixieland-influenced music between 1936-1940, not to mention ex Crosby-ite Bob Zurke.Nichols still had a knack for discovering young talent and so we find names among his bandmembers that were to gain fame with other band leaders later on: Heinie Beau, clarinet; Mike Bryan, guitar; Billy Maxted, piano; Conn Humphreys, saxes /arr.; Harry Jaeger, drums. He also employed coloured singer Bill Darnell (who came from Edgar Hayes' band and after Nichols broke up went with Bob Chester) whose voice, wide vibrato and husky delivery are not unlike Billy Eckstein's.A pleasant amalgam of not too familiar tunes , well arranged and played with only a minor portion of pop ephemera, recorded for RCA Bluebird between march 1939 and october 1939 and one, final, recording date for Okeh in june 1940. The band, although enjoying the universal acclaim of critics and public alike, encountered many problems (bookings and friction with the agency) and many important members had left by august 1940. Red carried on until 1942, without making any records, when he sold his band to Anson Weeks.Lovingly restored, with complete info on the band's history and discography, this is another gem that would deserve a larger audience.
I already knew the song &quot;Colorblind&quot; from the Cruel Intentions soundtrack and was crazy about it instantly. I wasn't exactly pleased with anything that came after &quot;August and Everything After&quot; until this cd was released (well except for the MTV/VH1 live recordings- which were magnificient as well) Do NOT miss this CD if you even think you're a Counting Crows fan. In the meanwhile, I'll be hangin' around..
In the prequel to the Dark Hunter series, Kenyon introduces us to a few of the players who will become regulars as well as giving us a small peek into the whims of the gods.I started the series in the middle, and have come back to the beginning to work my way through in the proper order. This novel is lighter in tone than the subsequent ones, although it has a dark moment or two.Both Grace and Julian are compelling characters who are well developed and capture your imagination and your heart. I found myself laughing out loud in parts, and completely enjoyed this fast, fun read.There were a couple of places where the narrative seemed a bit rushed, but Kenyon did her best to stay true to her characters realistic reactions while in the framework of a romance novel populated by gods.
This movie is not only a great tear jerker, but it should commemborate all the fallen civilians of the Trade Center and god bless them all. It was a terrible thing that this happened on 9-11 and this movie deserves nothing more than an oscar.Joel Segal gave this movie two thumbs up and you know what so do I. God Bless America and may all those people effected by the terror attack be placed in the kingdom of heaven.Great Movie. Huge Tear Jerker and it is for a good reason "The Emotion and terror that was seen that day".
Its no surprise that this was the least popular Alien movie. The other 3 movies were all a bit similar, Alien 3 was not a good film but at least it looked like the other films.This movie is compleetly diffrent from the other alien movies. Its weird and not beliveble. The aliens are not cool in this one and are often made with wery bad visual effects.Dont see this film. Not even once, if you have not seen Alien 1 and 2 then by all means see them. They are a must see.
This is without a doubt the best Football game out this year. EA has really improve the game play spiced up the graphics, and generally kicked...on this game. If you want "the game to own" this is it.
I was looking for a new MP3 player to replace my Sony NWZ-A816 which got stolen at a Filter concert. I saw this selling for $99 at Fred Myer and decided to try it out (I made sure to keep my receipt of course, incase I didn't like it). It looked like a nice player, it had a huge screen and 8gigs of storage. When I got home I uploaded some music to it and tried it out. The sound was so drab and dull compared to the Sony I had. I fiddled with the Customizable EQ to see if that'd help, no go. I heard it had something called "FullSound" technology, but I could not locate this function in any of the menus. (I also couldn't find the Radio function either). Even my 80 dollar Senheizer headphones sounded like crap with this thing, I have taken it back and now I am waiting for my local Best Buy to get more of the NWZA-728PNKBB. A big screen means nothing to me if the sound is no good.
I have many of her movies and she is SO hysterical! If you want a good laugh this is for you!
I have started this book a thousand times, over some forty years. I don't know why I felt this need to read it, but after just now finishing "Youngblood Hawke" I wish I had done so much earlier in my life. It is a book written by an artist about an artist for artists. Wouk of course is Hawke in the sense that Joe Gideon is Bob Fosse in "All That Jazz." I wouldn't be surprised if "Youngblood Hawke" was not on Fosse's top ten list, because it is in fact an expose on the life of an artist in the wicked world of the 20th century, a world getting even more wicked in this new millenium. I am a theatre artist and I wish I had read this novel before I ventured to New York and Broadway. Perhaps I would have seen the pitfalls I fell into before they happened.This is the first book I've read by Wouk, but, knowing some of his biographical material, I see that he was giving much of himself to the modern artist. He was writing a cautionary tale in which nothing was black and white, except the artistic process. But modern life never lets the artist just create. We must deal and cajole and hold back our true feelings for the almighty dollar until art gives way to artifice."Youngblood Hawke" was in the end a melancholy read not unlike the hero's own melancholy, like the malaise that permeates our world like one long reality TV show that isn't supposed to be scripted but is. Despite our knowledge of that fact, we watch on and live on buying into the lie that art is only good if it sells.Tell that to Van Gough and Shelley and Keats and Orson Welles.
I had Crystal Reports more than probably anything on the planet. I am biased towards web reporting in that it is where I have to spend my time. Crystal Reports itself may be fantastic in other formats, but for the web reporting, it is horrible.That said, it also has some pretty poor documentation and support, so that means books like this are essential.So the book itself is fantastic and you shouldn't be using Crystal Reports without it.Note that there are many areas not covered by the book in the web reporting wold, and so you will still need to do many Google searches to figure out what is going on, and in the end many times the issue is that Crystal Reports is just buggy.Occasionally they will patch something, and then it will be less buggy, but then things that previously worked will not, and this book will not (and really can't) account for those changes - so even with this book, you will need other reference resources as well.
Baby MacDonald is a wonderful video! It's filled with colour, movement, beautiful music, and charming video clips of farms around the world...there's everything from windmills in Holland and wheat fields in the Prairies to rice paddies in Asia. There's so much to look at in this video (including lots of animals!), my son never gets bored of it.Also cute are the puppet shows inserted into the video...my son loves them. There's one where a cow is picking apples and they keep falling on her head, another where pigs are going down a slide into a mud puddle that my son giggles at every time!This video is so cute that I really enjoy watching it with my son. I plan on getting more BE videos and I hope there are others as good as this one. (I already bought Baby Galileo and it was a HUGE disappointment!)If you enjoy farms, animals, or the outdoors, get this video for your baby! Note: The DVD is better than the video because the special features are great--about another 20 minutes of puppets shows, singing, and stories!
The Moroccan philosopher Mohammed Abed al-Jabri is one of the most prominent modern thinkers in the Arab and Islamic world. The collection of essays published under the title ARAB-ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY. A COMTEMPORARY CRITIQUE is the first of al-Jabri's works to appear in English and it provides an excellent introduction to al-Jabri's ideas.Al-Jabri's project is an endeavor to establish a link between modernity and tradition. He wants it to be clear that modernity does not imply a break with the tradition, but rather an upgrading of the way modern Arabs/Muslims can relate to that tradition. Modernity is also something that has to be developed from within Arab culture instead of just copying European modernist methods. For according to al-Jabri the main insight to be gained is the awareness of the relativity and historicity of each and every tradition. Tradition does not represent an absolute reality transcending history.The essays are organized into two parts. In the first section the author opts for a systematic approach of the subject matter, while the second set of essays provides the historical setting in which the tradition took shape, and identifies the germination of rationalist approaches developing within that tradition.In the first chapter on the shortcomings of traditional discourse, al-Jabri presents three alternative readings of tradition. The fundamentalist reading presents the past as a means to establish and confirm identity. Taking the form of a retreat into a defensive stand, it projects a `radiant future' based upon an `ideological fabrication of the past'. Then there is a liberal reading of the tradition. Clearly derived from European thinking it has espoused an `orientalist discourse' and reads one tradition through another. Such modern Arab liberal thinking contains a real danger of identity alienation. The third reading, the Marxist one, is qualified by al-Jabri as a ready-made dialectical method that must be considered as scientifically unsound because it posits an outcome before engaging into the analysis.The second chapter is the most lucid portion of the book, and it provides a convenient summary of al-Jabri's thinking as detailed in his main work `Critique of Arab Reason'. Referring to the three alternative readings of Arab tradition, al-Jabri points out that they suffer from two major weaknesses: a weakness of method - caused by a lack of objectivity - and a weakness of vision - due to a lack of historical awareness.The lack of objectivity is a result of the flawed epistemology of Arab-Islamic thought, caused by the wrong application of the analogy method. In the Islamic context this became the scientific method par excellence, but it was applied wrongly by jurists, theologians and grammarians alike. In a similar vein can the lack of historical perspective be contributed to a limited view of the past, which is taken as transcendental and sacral, and must therefore be considered as a-historical.Next al-Jabri poses the question how to escape from this deadlock. From the outset the author makes it clear that this epistemological break does not constitute a break on the level of knowledge itself, but takes place on the level of the mental act. Thinkers should not be `taken by tradition' but rather `embrace tradition'. This necessitates a `disjunction between object and subject' as al-Jabri calls it. Without it objectivity is impossible.First of all the subject should be disjoined from the object in order to get rid of a biased understanding of tradition based on that tradition itself. This can be achieved by a meticulous dissection of texts. The next step is to disjoin object from subject. For this operation al-Jabri suggests a process that is made up of three steps: a structuralist approach, which searches for the constants in a text tradition; a historical approach that links the author's thinking to his historical context; and a ideological approach, which envisages a synthesis between the structuralist and historical readings of the text.Then follows what must be considered the most difficult part of al-Jabri methodology: reconnecting subject and object into a meaningful relationship. Here Mohammed al-Jabri's project of rationalist critique appears to suffer a relapse, for the author suggests nothing less than that this rejoining can only be achieved through intuition. Although he adds immediately that he is not talking about a mystical, personalist or phenomenological intuition, this reviewer is of the opinion that the search for the `unsaid' or the `hidden strategy' of a discourse constitutes a breach in the original train of thought. Al-Jabri's claim that all philosophers kept some ideas to themselves sounds unconvincing and appears to be at odds with the writer's outright hostility towards to Gnostic elements in the thinking of, for example, Ibn Sina [Avicenna].After having dealt with the methodological flaws of Arab-Islamic philosophy, al-Jabri shifts his attention to the issue of vision. Whether we like it or not, vision makes up the framework of method. All systems of thought gravitate around a specific `problematics', in the case of Arab-Islamic philosophy the reconciliation between reason and transmission. This problematics was approached through a specific Islamic reading of Greek philosophy. But the modern students of this Islamic philosophy have failed to make a distinction between the cognitive and ideological perspectives of this reading. This failure has resulting in the qualification of Islamic philosophy as being immobile and `avoid of progress and of dynamics'.This qualification is taken up by al-Jabri at the beginning of his historical essays. Their main purpose is to dispel this myth of immobility. For although the cognitive material has remained intransigent, the ideological use of it was dynamic. Al-Jabri characterizes Islamic philosophy as a militant ideological discourse around the problematics of reason and transmission, constantly facing challenges by the reactionary and conservative elements of society. In the second essay al-Jabri identifies these enemies as the Gnostics on the one hand, and the rigorist legal scholars on the other.In the third historical essay entitled `The Andalusian Resurgence' al-Jabri prepares the ground for his own version of the future of Arab-Islamic thought. Sketching the specific pluralist setting of the Islamic extreme northwest its thinkers were uniquely well positioned and prepared to tackle philosophical questions. Far removed from the ideological and political controversies raging in the central and eastern parts of the Islamic world, the thinkers of Muslim Spain and Northwest Africa could almost at their leisure internalize founding scientific disciplines, such as mathematics, physics, and logic before engaging into metaphysics. The two major exponents of this philosophical tradition, according to al-Jabri, were Ibn Hazm (994-1063) and Ibn Rushd [Averroes] (1126-1198).Rejecting the flawed analogy methods of the tradition and Gnostic mysticism alike, Ibn Hazm was a great promoter of the demonstrative method. Ibn Rushd further continued this axiomatic approach in his simultaneous rejection of the Gnostic residues in Avicennian thought and al-Ghazali's offensive against the philosophers. Although in the west he is generally known as a commentator of Aristotle, al-Jabri insists that Ibn Rushd did not intend to defend Aristotle against all cost, but merely sought to understand him.According to al-Jabri, it is because of the critique of all epistemological principles that he considers Ibn Rushd as the greatest inspirer for all future Arab-Islamic thought. Translated into modern terms: the Averroist legacy of realism, axiomatic method, and critical approach can help Muslims to construct their own reality. Instead of reading a future in the past, such an expression of a native experience would bring Muslims in touch with their historical consciousness.
Do not get this unless you have the first version. This version has remastered and shortened tracks. I am gonna review the regualr version --- I got this CD after hearing the track 11 or "B*tch I am Sexy." So obviously, I thought it was going to be a funny album. I was very surprised when I started listening to it and it is pretty much like the first Hell's Pit because it is so dark. There are a couple songs that are flat-out hilarious. But most of the songs are hella sick and scary. Now, i always and always give juggalo albums 5 stars because I have usually loved all the songs on other Psycopathic Records, but even as a HUGE juggalo, I have to say, some of these songs were terrible, i mean so terrible you will never listen to them twice. Now, obviously this is a huge album for Psychopathic, and it is a great album. I think what happened was they ran out of beats and used old beats that really didn't sound great. But for a dark rap album this is still good. The best songs are 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12 and 15. Now the reason all juggalos need to buy this album is because of track 15. It's called Juggalo Family, this in my opinion is the most loyal song to Psychopathic ever made.
Mech2 is one of those titles I continuously come back to-it's just a good chunk of fun! Who wouldn't like stomping around in 20+ ton walkers with WMD destructive power? The game-more like simulator-is excellent. It has a text-only storyline for 2 opposing sides, Wolf Clan and Jade Falcon Clan, relatively deep lore, and mech customization for those nutty type of folk...like me. The controls are where things get a bit interesting, because there's no good equivalent to independent strafing, making modern shooter controls a touch weird. But... you don't get this game if you're a "modern" gamer. You get this game because you played it way back when and want to relive it. Keep in mind you'll need an old machine or emu to play it, but it DOES work, and it DOES work well! Have fun, and let the best clan win!
And he's also ugly and stupid. Michael (I hate America, I hate white people) Mooron is one reason I am glad Bush was reelected. I am also glad his film failed to win a single Oscar and that he got kicked out of the Republican National Convention. He also failed to become TIME Magazine's person of the year, guess who became TIME Magazine's person of the year; George W. Bush!They say being on the cover of TIME magazine makes you look fatter. But when you don't fit in the darn thing, does it really matter?
I read this novel many years ago, when it was originally published. I had forgotten how well written it is and what a wonderful character development it has. Highly recommended.
I have not been able to make this stopper fit even one sparkling wine bottle, French or American. It simply doesn't fit on, despite very considerable effort. After many attempts I ended up throwing it out.UPDATE: Based on comments by another person who got a defective one, it appears that the issue may be a quality-control problem at the manufacturer. I would not recommend this item, since if you one of the defective ones, you're going to be just as dissatisfied.
Kester is the best solder brand made...when I bought this item I didn't understand just how thin 0.031" actually is....in fact it feels like about the thickness of 3 hairs and almost as fragile....this item is designed for very very delicate PC board repairs and not for general purpose old fashioned electronic repairs of all sorts...but it can be used for anything electronic if you can adjust to the tiny tiny size
If you can't install all the Perl modules you want (say on a $12.99/month commercial host), give PHP a try. It has weaknesses and strengths vis-&agrave;-vis Perl, but you can use both! They work well together, and with XHTML, CSS, and MySQL. Who says you have to choose one over the other?After scouring the web for tutorials and sample code, I think this book is the quickest way to get up to speed. It is concise with excellent code samples, warnings of pitfalls, and techniques for thwarting adversaries (hackers). It is straightforward without annoying cuteness or humor.PHP code lives entirely within a web page. Some advantages:1. You don't have to make print statements for all the HTML on the page; the PHP code can be inserts in the HTML.2. Flow control. A page can include its own associated programming logic for easier maintenance and an uncluttered webroot directory. A form page can recursively call itself, instead of a separate script, for processing, and can call other pages.3. It's embarrassingly *EASY* to learn with this book!Some instructions just changed names (split is "explode," next is "continue") but other instructions are new and super-handy for the web! Sessions and cookie-handling are built in to the language (chapter 8). Scope rules and data structures are different; you can't shift, pop, or test for undef, but you get two-dimensional arrays.If you go this route I guarantee you will have read this entire book, plus some of the online PHP manual, by the time your site is done. This book is not comprehensive but selects an excellent breadth of features.One typo is unforgivable, and for that I unapologetically deduct a star: the very first database example in Chapter 1 shows $db->numrows() without the parentheses, which does not work. I spent two days trying to figure out what was wrong. Very confusing since the old way of doing it (before PHP's PEAR extensions) was mysql_num_rows &lt;--without parentheses.TIP: Do NOT assume that your host is on PHP 5! Though mine advertises 5, they put you on 4 unless you ask for 5. This one-line program will tell you which version you're on: &lt;?php phpinfo(); ?>TIP #2: Blank web page got you down? You can see the syntax error by running it from a command line, like this: php5 mypage.php
Hung in there through page 89, then realized I'm not immortal and don't have time to deal with this. Am willing to start a charitable foundation to provide Ms. Pessl a lifetime supply of Ritalin and a scholarship to the Iowa Writers Workshop. Care to join me?
I wasn't really expecting much of this book, but was pleasantly surprised. I have read two other Follett books, The Pillars of the Earth and Night Over Water. Pillars is great, aside from the dismal sex scenes, and Night Over Water is completely forgettable.This one is a nice page-turner. On top of the surprisingly interesting setting of 19th Century merchant banking, the characters are pretty well-developed. It takes a little while to get immersed, but once you are in there, it's easy to follow and enjoyable. I found myself really rooting for the protagonists, and without being a spoiler, it's nice that while everything doesn't turn out just peachy, basically everyone gets "what they deserve." There are some surprising twists -- some a little melodramatic, but not too over the top.Overall, I'd recommend this. Not good for reading at night in bed.... I stayed up WAY to late to finish it!
I'm relatively new to the whole Blu-ray thing; indeed, I resisted buying a Blu-ray player for a long time because I imagined that older movies (e.g., Wrath of Khan) would look grainy and dated in this format, which mercilessly exposes the flaws in older film prints.So I was pleasantly surprised when "Wrath of Khan" ended up looking, to me, rather good on Blu-ray. It's by no means a perfect print; for example, there's usually some fuzz (or whatever the technical term is) visible on scenes with dark lighting, such as when the Enterprise bridge goes to red alert. But by and large, this print is much nicer than the previous DVD versions.I compared some DVD scenes to Blu-ray ones to determine whether the upgrade was worth it, and I think it was. Check out the scene when Spock gives Kirk his birthday present; on Blu-ray, you can see all the fine details on that giant globe they're standing next to, whereas on the DVD print it just looks like some glass blob. Similarly, the nebula scenes look much clearer on the Blu-ray.Some fans seem annoyed that "digital noise reduction" has been applied to the Star Trek movies. Again, I'm no technical expert, but I believe this means that the artifacting/fuzz/whatever-you-call-it has been digitally "painted out" to give the film a cleaner look. This has led some fans to complain that the ST films now look artificially painted over, or waxy, or whatever. I sympathize with this complaint, but I think there's a tough choice to be made here; either studios can digitally "paint out" flaws, resulting in a slightly artificial look, or they can leave the flaws in, resulting in a distracting grainy look. Based on my Blu-ray experiences so far, I favor the noise reduction; for example, the Star Trek Blu-rays look much nicer to me than Fargo, which looks like it was shot through a layer of gauze.The only real disappointment is that "Wrath of Khan" is only available in its theatrical cut, not the (slightly) better extended cut. It's a shame that Paramount doesn't give you a choice between the two versions; for "Khan," I'd pick the extended cut, and for "Undiscovered Country" I'd go with the theatrical one, but so far Paramount has not released versions that offer the option of switching.But still, I think "Khan" looks so much nicer as a Blu-ray that I'd rather watch this copy than the special edition DVD. I don't even have a problem with the much-loathed "Delta shield" menu, which may be basic, but has a certain elegance to it...
this collection is, for the most part, written directly from recordings of tribe members retelling the stories. there is a nice sense of authenticity in the collection, but many of the stories really seem to be collected for the sake of collecting the stories... in other words, there is a definite inconsistency throughout this book.it can be tedious to get through some parts, because the legends occasionally seem to go nowhere. it seems that many of these myths are explanations of how something came in to being, rather than a moralistic message, and in this sense it is valuable in presenting insight into the worlview of the cultures represented. nevertheless, as a reader it is enjoyable to feel that a story is leading up to something, which is not always the case here.i was surprised by the politically incorrect title (First Nations is the preferred term nowadays- "Indians" is considered offensive), but the book was published in 1984 so this makes sense- perhaps a reprint will have a different title.
The sheer depth of what Marx tries to tackle, regardless if one subscribes to it or not, is nothing short of amazing...and is reason alone to (attempt) to read Capital. It is not a bible, and those who treat it as such most likely have not read it. It is a stunningly accurate critique of political economy as it was then and as it has unfolded today. To conclude, for common misconceptions, Capital identifies the many inconsistencies and problems of political economy in the realm of the Capitalist mode of production. What it does not do is outline how to organize and make work a "socialist" or centrally planned economy. To say that the decline of the 'socialist' states make Marx and his work obsolete is pure madness.Perhaps the main difficulty, and perhaps even the reason for such misunderstanding and misinterpretation, is that Marx did not build foundations of knowledge in the traditional way. His world is complex, as it should be, and everything relates to everything else. Nothing is viewed in isolation or analyzed individually. At the same time he takes the reader through layers of abstraction in an attempt to reconstruct the real world step by step from a single the concept of the dualism of labor and the contradictions it emanates (labor and labor-power). That Marx was able to deduce his entire theory from a single beginning remains one of the most fascinating features of his work. Another important aspect of his analysis is that it broke away from the classical dogma of political economy being confined to a relation of things and things which essentially concealed the complexities of the human element behind them (unfortunately even more characteristic of mainstream economic theory today). Marx was thus able to comprehend the 'laws' of motion of capitalist production, what the classicists failed to complete. while at the same time its limitations as socio-economic system in the continued development of the productive forces of society.Unfortunately, there tends to be a large number of people that have never been exposed to Marx and listen to a small segment of the population that rallies against Marx due to either cold war ideological or dogmatic nonsense - Any serious reader of Capital will clearly see that this work lacks politicized bias infringing on objectivity that has infiltrated most writings today. Not only is it truly exceptional, but it is the most important contribution to economic thought ever. I can only write this general review - a concise overview would be, at my level, impossible.
This whole series is interesting, informative, and simply written. I have all 22 books and love them. If you like the Native genre and being right inside the lifestyle of the Cheyenne, these books will give you great satisfaction. And---the prices I have seen listed are so low that it would be a crime not to purchase and enjoy them. Go for it! Emma K
I'm a human being, a recoverer from childhood trauma, a therapist, and a reader. This collection of essays by professional researchers of &quot;the human condition&quot; affirms for me a profound truth about all of us, and why we do what we do. These veteran authors' central theme is &quot;multiplicity&quot; - the little-acknowledged universal fact that our &quot;minds&quot; are naturally modular, routinely producing a range of subselves or subpersonalities that we experience as one &quot;me&quot;. One profound implication is that &quot;you and me&quot; are two physical people - and also two *groups* of *selves* all interacting in complex ways, simultaneously, in ways we're only vaguely conscious of.Author/editors John Rowan and Mick Cooper have done lay people and professionals a great service by bringing together a group of articulate experts who weave a convincing meta-story affirming our *multiplicity* across theory, research, and practice. The implications of what they collectively say are - in my biased opinion - world-view shifting. If most people in our culture or world accepted that each of us is a *group* of people, without being *crazy* in the least - I suspect our society would shift dramatically, in many good ways.One of the many benefits of this book is the buffet of different articulate concepts that are spread before the reader. There is a unifying theme, but a rich diversity of background, perspective, conceptions, terminology, and enterpretations that empowers each reader to sample and construct our own belief about &quot;multiplicity&quot; and it's personal and social meaning.The content of this book, and the credibility of it's group of authors, has shifted how I think about myself, you, and our fellow Beings - even after 62 years of observing and mulling. The implications of what these wise people write are vast, and beyond summary here.I believe anyone - not just clinicians - with genuine interest in personal growth, behavior, and potential will significantly profit from reading this and related books like &quot;Internal Family Systems Therapy&quot;, by Richard Schwartz. Another interesting, useful book is &quot;Embracing Each Other&quot;, by psychologists Hal and Sidra Stone.
I just don't understand it. I guess Collide missed the boat when it came to publicity or something. Maybe they didn't pay off the right person to get some airplay. It's almost criminal, in my opinion, that this band isn't a lot bigger... and that I only heard of them 3 months ago.These two (kaRIN and Statik) are absolute geniuses. Statik shows expert musical manipulations with every song, and kaRIN's voice is drop-dead gorgeous. And they are both inventive with the styles they use throughout all the music. There are no two songs here that sound the same, but a very impressive variety, ranging from the noisy jackhammer of &quot;Beneath the Skin&quot; to the peaceful flow of &quot;Deep&quot; and &quot;Black&quot;...This album has it all... it's accessible without being cheezy, and beautiful without being bland... For more proof listen to the samples here and the (full-length) samples on Collide's homepage. It'll blow your damn mind. Then buy the CD's and support a band that should be a legend... and hopefully will.
Tell me, who doesn't love a captivating book? A book that keeps you turning the page in earnest to know what happens next? This is just that type of book. I've read it twice, and will read it again.Dan Brown amazes me with his powerful ability to twist fact and fiction to create his masterpieces. As in his book Angels & Demons, Brown shows off his talent using historical information to create an amazing adventure, leaving me mystified and enlightened. With a delightful twist ending, I find myself wanting to read the book all over again. Through his characters' eyes, I'm able to grasp the brilliance and breath-taking power of historical art with a new appreciation and understanding.
There's so many things to do with this. Stack the rings, link them together, crinkle the ears, rattle the balls, put the balls in and hear the music. IT's a great toy for little eyes and hands. We love ours so much, (my daughter is 7 mos), I'm buying another one right now for a friend's first birthday!
Eric Bergerud has produced a very good soldier's history of the land war in the South Pacific. For Americans, this is a sadly understudied period, often ignored in favor of the far larger battles on the Central Pacific Islands or the Philippines. However, it was during this period that the outcome of the war in the Pacific was actually in doubt, and therefore where the Japanese were on a relatively equal footing with the Allies. The relative forces involved make the American involvement certainly equal to the parallel operations in North Africa and Sicily, but at that time we were far from being even equal partners with the British. It is a fascinating campaign in an exotic region, and Bergerud treats it as such.Bergerud takes a Keeganesque approach, but balances it with the necessity of his narrative. Those looking for an in-depth strategical analysis should look elsewhere - jungle wars are by necessity not wars of large manuver units. It is, by necessity, a grunt's story. However, Bergerud's narrative does describe the campaign and some of the higher strategic considerations which led to those grunts being sent to wherever they were sent, and why their respective armies sent them out to fight the way that they did. The narrative takes the reader on a fascinating journey through life as a combat solider in the South Pacific: where he fought, how he was wounded, injured or rendered ill (disease being a huge problem in the jungles of the South Pacific), how he was cared for in injury and death, what he ate, how he was armed, why he fought, and all the other elements that you need to really understand what a rifleman's life was like. The author makes good use of veterans' interviews in illustrating his points.Australians will take comfort (and hopefully Americans will learn something) in the attention paid to their contribution in the South Pacific. The MacArthur propaganda legacy does not hold sway over this book.If there is any great failing in this book, it is the lack of material present about the Japanese. At times, coverage of the Japanese is excellent. However, at no time does the author use as much interview material from Japanese veterans as he does from Allied vets. Also, Bergerud gives Japanese morale the short end of the stick. That is a serious flaw, given that by the time one reaches the chapter on morale, a reader should be painfully aware of just how much every Japanese attack in the South Pacific (even the successful ones) resembled massacres. What motivated these men to go and die in droves is a subject worthy of a serious examination, and Bergerud does not give it one.That aside, this is a great book for anyone wanting to bone up on the South Pacific campaign!
Burns deserves credit for this monumental undertaking--one which hopefully, will bring an uninitiated audience into a deeper understanding of jazz.All the critics of this series seem to think it should have been targeted to an audience of jazz experts. But Burns was trying to educate a mass audience.People are whining because Chick Corea, Pat Metheny, and other post-modern players were left out. Too bad. Did those men make the contributions that Ellington or Armstrong made? I think not.Others have said that the series is basically a mouthpiece for Marsalis and Crouch. I think both Marsalis and Crouch made intelligent statements and provided insightful analysis of the music.Those of us who are really into jazz don't even need to watch this documentary. We have all done our homework. But for a mass audience, I think Burns did something significant and meaningful here.I would have liked to have seen more coverage of Ahmad Jamal, Sun Ra, and dozens of other players and composers. But I don't mind. I'm just glad that a famous film maker did a comprehensive series about the music. The ignorant listening public needs to know about this distinctive American art form.
The end of the world seems to be a common topic for novels these days, and into the fray runs this entry into the genre. The drift is that a great plague has been unleashed on man, inadvertently of course, by a wealthy art collector's obsession for the discovery of an artifact of the historical Jesus. The world is in ruin, there are millions dead in the the calamity that follows it. We follow some of the survivors, a child genius, an archeologist and a few others as they seek to resolve personal issues and discover a cure. We are witness in the tale to a dark, grim portrayal of civilization as it decays around them with the faintest of rays of hope. The characters are compelling even if one can not identify with them. We are not overburdened with the science. Mr. Long, in an afterword says tht it started as a medical thriller, buth then evolved in the writing into an exploration of Religion v. Science in the setting of the apocalypse. He succeeds in its writing. Though not the happiest of books, it leaves us with that glimmer that perhaps we will have our woes, even on a cosmic scale, and that it just may be all right.
You laugh, you say, &quot;Whoa cool!,&quot; you cry, but mostly you say, &quot;whoa Cool!&quot; Anyways...Jeffrey (Chow) is a hired killer and is pretty cool. Until one killer evening, he accidently blinds a nightclub singer, and does one last job to pay for her eye operation. Howvever, things don't go as planned, when both sides of the law are after him.Logic does not play a big part of this movie, action does. So don't go expecting a realistic movie, instead expect a supurbly done action-drama. The last scene in the church is one for the record books. The best part of the movie (in my humble opinion of course) is when the Mary statue is blown up and this very sad music plays, very good. Another great masterpiece from the collaberation of John Woo/Chow Yun-Fat.
&quot;The Warriors of God&quot; examines the Third Crusade of the late 12th century with a focus on the remarkable opposing leaders: the Sultan Saladin and Richard I of England (the Lionheart). The Crusades are a confusing epoch since they spanned several hundred years and included a shifting cast of characters with equally shifting motives. With the exception of the First Crusade that established the Frankish Kingdom in the Middle East, the Third Crusade was the event of singular importance whose ramifications ripple to the present. A strong Frankish Kingdom would have altered the balance of power in the Middle East in unforeseeable ways. For instance, the Ottoman Turks may not have been able to topple the Byzantine Empire had another powerful Christian kingdom existed nearby.Reston portrays the events surrounding the Crusade with remarkable clarity. Saladin (who was Kurdish) emerges as a skillful politician and military leader who unites a fragmented group of Islamic principalities into a formidable empire that wrenches Jerusalem and much of the territory won in the First Crusade from the Christians. Richard the Lionheart then bursts on the scene as the most formidable individual warrior and military leader that Saladin and his Moslem force face. Reston brings these events to life using narratives from both Christian and Islamic sources. A remarkable respect between Saladin and Richard evolves as the leaders communicate by emissaries that even include the Sultan's brother. Chivalry clearly exists despite the overall brutality of the conflict. Reston describes how Saladin's shaken emirs at one point suggest contracting with the dreaded Assassins to have Richard killed. Saladin vetoed the suggestion as being dishonorable, despite the fact that Richard had single-handedly driven the Crusaders to the hills overlooking Jerusalem and was poised to shatter Saladin's empire. Few historical treatises are as engaging as this fine book.
This book should be considered a must read for any Christian desiring to grow in Christ. Gary Thomas provides an excellent introduction to several of the classics and provides enough solid growth material to whet the appetite for further reading. His points are well illustrated and backed by scriptural fact. The book is an enjoyable read, and truly great re-read and pure joy to teach!!!
This would be a 5-star IDE if not for Metrowerks' decision to drop Pascal support. That fact was unbeknownst to me when I bought this upgrade, which is now worthless because of my investment in Pascal-based legacy products. Metrowerks was kind enough to send me version 4.0, however, and promises to re-introduce OS X Pascal support at a later date.
The Persian (Iranian) Classical Music system was not developed upon the Arabic invasion of 7th century A.D, nor within the Safavid court. Persian music dates back to the pre-Islamic, Sassanid Dynasty (224BC-651AD)of Iran and was created by Sassanid court musicians much before the Arabic invasion. These musicians were Borbad, Nakisa, and Ramtin and created a system of 7 royal modes, 30 derivative modes and 365 melodic movements branching from the modes, one melody for each day of the year. This was the first musical system in the entire Middle East! It was known as the "Khosravani" and the "Dasgtah."The royal music functioned as court entertainment, but more importantly within religious contexts. The divine mantras of Prophet Zoroaster (Prophet of the world's first monotheistic religion) were sung within the modes as studies by www.raasti.com have shown us. Purely Iranian musical instruments are: Ney (reed flute, earliest known instrument), barbat (what Arabs call the Ud, created in Iran around 800BC), tambur (dates to around same time as barbat), setar (came after tambur), tar(came with setar but evolved to its present form later), dotar (same as setar), kamancheh(same time as barbat), gheichak, neyanban, sorna, balaban, tombak, dap (upon Arab invasion called "daf" because Arabs cannot say "p," This instrument dates back to Achaemenid Dynasty of Iran as is depicted on the ancient bass relief "Bistun") dayre, robab, and chang (harp, which dates back to 2000BC in Iran). These instruments were all used in Sassanid era of Iran through all the dynasties in between and to present day.Upon the Arab-Islamic invasion of a Zoroastrian Iran, music was banned by Arab-Islamic fanatics and later by Iranian fanatics who had converted to Islam. The music was still practiced by masters and passed down to students in the same oral tradition. Once Iranians reclaimed their rule, they brought back musical activity. The Arabic language had an impact on Parsi (Farsi) because Iranians were forced to have Arabic as an official language. Later, Parsi became the official language once again. While some words in Parsi were replaced by Arabic words, Parsi remains the same Parsi spoken during the Sassanid era alongside the Pahlavi language. Because of Arabic lone words, the musical modes were called "mayehs" or "maqam" but they were the same Sassanid modes and melodies.The art of singing poetry originated within the Sassanid Era. That's how they sung the Zoroastrian manthras within the modes. Non-religious poetry was also written and indeed sung by Borbad and other musicians during the Sassanid era. After the introduction of Islam, and by the Safavid era, Zoroatrian manthras no longer accompanied music. Songs of Islamic tales and poems by 9th-14th century Iranian poets such as Rudaki, Rumi, Attar, Khayyam, and Hafez replaced the manthras and pre-Islamic poems.The fact that Iranian Classical Music is a spiritual tool dates back to even before the Sassanid and Achaemenid Dynasty of Iran! It is strictly an Iranian view that through music, one finds God. It has been since pre-Zoroastrian times. This is why Iranians incorporated music into Islam and founded their own branch of Islam known as Sufism!Anyway, during the Qajar Dynasty of Iran, the ancient Sassanid modal system was gathered, revived and organized within a framework called the "Radif." There are 12 modes (dastgah) and 200 melodic movements (gushe). The majority of the modes and melodic mocements are from that ancient Sassanid system. But, because of the evolving nature of music, a few of the melodies were altered and a few others were added through time. The ancient compositions that were lost are because of those religious fanatics or because they weren't crucial.
I love these speakers..just what I've been looking for. It does take 12 batteries but worth it.ETA: I will also say that I had to go to Radio shack and by the splitter for my inside speakers in order for the inside and outside to work at the same time. It was $5I also splurged and bought rechargeable batteries. A little expensive..but if you listen to as much music as I do..worth it!!I have now had these for awhile now..and I still love them!!
If DOUBLE JEOPARDY had any brains, it would be dangerous. Then again, if DOUBLE JEOPARDY had any brains it probably wouldn't have been made. Vacuous , bereft of anything resembling logic, common sense, or respect for itself or its audience, it is a movie made either by morons or for morons.The movie takes its title from the legal precept that no person can be tried twice for the same crime. In this case, the crime is the murder of Libby Parsons' (Ashley Judd) husband during a boating excursion. Covered in blood, she wakens to find her husband Nick (Bruce Greenwood) missing, and is subsequently tried and convicted for his murder. In prison, she discovers that her husband is in fact alive. Upon her release, she breaks her parole and begins her search for Nick while being pursued by parole officer Travis Lehman (played by a weary Tommy Lee Jones).Plot holes abound. Libby never awakens when Nick paints her with blood and sloshes around all of this manufactured evidence. (Further, the filmmakers never reveal where he acquired all of this blood in the first place.) Her lawyer never asks the coroner's office to analyze the blood to prove that it is in fact Nick's. Libby is convicted, presumably, of first-degree murder but does not seem to be in one of the more violent prison wards. She is released on parole after serving seven years but is not put under any kind of intensive supervision. She outruns sherrif's jeeps on a beach but is captured once the officers pursue her on foot. Upon her arrest, Lehman leaves her handcuffed to to his car while he gets a cup coffee but leaves his keys in the ignition, providing her with a means of escape. And, curiously, the media seems absent from all of this. Apparently not one news program along the lines of 20/20 or DATELINE or 48 HOURS sends a reporter out to cover her story at any time. Has television lost interest in beautiful murderesses, unjustly accused?The cast is strong, but the characters are underwritten and the performances are uninspired. Ashley Judd never convinces the viewer that she is capable of bloodlust or cunning. Further, though she wears dowdy clothes once she leaves prison, one never believes that she has done any hard time. Jones, in playing Lehman, has filed the serial numbers from the character of Sam Gerard in THE FUGITIVE. It is virtually the same character, but given an unconvincing backstory. Bruce Greenwood plays Libby's husband with the right amount of smarm but is otherwise one-dimensional.Much has been made of the female empowerment aspects of DOUBLE JEOPARDY, but in reality the movie does little to empower women. Libby acts like a victim throughout, and in at least one instance allows herself to become victimized. Goldie Hawn throwing off her veil at the end of PRIVATE BENJAMIN does more to empower women than Libby does drawing a bead on her slime of a husband.
I use this rake on my Newfoundland. The hair behind her ears tens to mat from time to time. This cuts through them without much discomfort to the dog, and without having to cut the mat out completely.Ideally, a dog would never get matted enough to need this, but most of us just don't have/take time to stay on top of the grooming 24/7. This tool is nice to have when it's time to play catch-up.
Good set for a decent price, will do just about anything you need it to do. If you don't get the set, the one piece here that I use all the time and love love love is the large saute pan. Cooks evenly, looks great, feels amazing to use.
Love may not cost a thing, but this movie does and its not worth it. The male character goes from erkel to puff doody overnight and is never likeable. Why the hot chick goes for him after all the stupid stuff he pulls is beyond comprehension. Stereotypes abound in this movie and none of them add anything to the humorless wreck. At the end I felt sorry for the nice selfless cheerleader (one non-stereotype anyway) who ends up with the goofy jerk in the end.
I'm a big survivor fan. I've seen nearly every season at this point, and this was the second survivor season that I saw. I loved it at the time, and have been anxiously awaiting it's release. But now after viewing it again, it wasn't as good as I remembered. In fact, it really doesn't hold up to the newer seasons.There was so little strategy by these contestants, so little drama, so few heroics, and certainly no memorable villains. Neither of the final 2 really seemed very deserving (in terms of controlling the game or in terms of dominating challenges). The whole season was just very "meh" in hindsight. I'd be hard pressed to rank anything that happened in this season as one of the more memorable survivor moments, and the same could be said for the participants themselves. I guess it's a testament to how good the later seasons have become that this one seems to vanilla.
This book is about a young girl named Hannah, a jewish fugitive running from the Inquistion. This book takes you through Hannah's struggle, hardships, pain, and encounters that she expericences while at court. It is really a small twist of the Cinderella story theme but ten times better! Great book, I recommend to all.
I know what you're thinking.. a sequel to one of the greatest movies ever made, done 20 years after the fact. It's sure to be a bomb. Right? Wrong.Psycho 2 continues the story of Norman Bates, who after spending several years locked up in a mental institution after murdering several people, has been deemed fit to return to society once again. Some people, particularly Lila Loomis, the sister of Marion Crane who was murdered by Bates, disagree. After returning home, Norman soon begins to receive notes and phone calls from his "mother". Little does Norman know that Lila is behind it all, and begins to become convinced that his mother has returned from the grave and slides back down the slope of insanity. One by one, those who don't know enough to stay away from the Bates house begin to disappear.. The town sherrif becomes suspicious that Norman is up to his old tricks, but no one knows for sure..Anthony Perkins once again was brilliant as the tormented Norman Bates, and a solid supporting cast along with tons of suspense really make the movie work. Nothing can match the original Psycho, but this is most definitely an effective sequel that's worth a watch.
I'm impressed with this gauge. I've owned it for several months now, and have no complaints. It feels solid and well-made, the display is easily visible, and it's fairly easy to press over the valve stem. Haven't had to replace batteries yet. It's apparently accurate - it reads within 1 PSI of my other digital gauge (different brand) and my old "stick" gauge, and it's much easier to read than either of those!Great gift idea!
This phone works amazingly well in most aspects. The call clarity is great and the menu system works very well. I especially find the hot bar menu system on the start screen very convienent. The mp3 player function workds remarkably well and with a 2 gb smartchip, this think becomes a monster media device. My one grievance is the camara on it. It lags horribly when you try and take a piture that is not staying perfectly still. In all, I highly recommend this phone.
I have to admit EA sports FIFA series has definitely been a center of attraction for football gamers around the globe for quite some time. Now after Konami has introduced their line of Football games starting with Winning Eleven 6 they have dominated since. The quality of Winning Eleven 7 has put EA sports FIFA series to shame because of it's realistic Football gameplay. The graphics are not quite as good as EA but realistic gameplay is all that matters and that is why this game gets 5 out of 5. There are a few bugs but it's nothing Konami can't fix unlike EA who keep transfering those bugs to every new game and don't really know how to fix them. This game is worth every penny unlike EA's games which should be worth a penny in comparison. If you are a true footie fan then you will enjoy everything this game has to offer from passing to scoring goals because in this game anything goes and there is no specific formulated way of scoring goals!! All I can say now is EA step aside 'cause Konami has taken over PERMANENTLY!!!
After reading the first two editions of the Unseen Trilogy I was thrilled to have my hands on the third and final installment. As a matter of fact, I was so excited I stopped reading my current book and started on Long Way Home (something I never do). I was very disappointed.The first two book took Buffy, Angel, and their respective gangs on extraordinary journies full of adventure; with exciting plot lines interweaved and created a complex, exciting, and though-provoking story that left my mouth watering for more. Unfortunately, the conclusion was a huge letdown.First of all there are a few inconsistancies. The third book does not pick up where the second book left off. In fact, it's as though the final few paragraphs of Doors To Alternity never even happened. Secondly, within the prologue there is a major continuity discrepency. The book takes place between seasons 4 and 5 of the series, however there was a direct reference to something that happened well into season 5! I was annoyed that the writers and the editors didn't catch it.My major complaint about the plot was not the lack of imagination, cause there was certainly plenty; it was the congested feeling. Too much was happening at once. I think Holder and Morriette should have slowed down a little. It felt as if they needed to get everyone's point of view into the book so that the story could move forward quickly. It had a very rushed feeling and it was exhausting to read. Many of the subplots (i.e. Kate) were pointless, anyway! they could have cut a good 50 pages just by leaving the jibberish stuff out!I enjoyed the Buffy and Angel subplot, but I thought Spike's part in the story was ludicrous. The back of the book made it seem like he would be a major contributing factor to the events and in reality he wasn't. Faith didn't appear until the story was nearly over and the writers did not do a good job with the characterization at all. More intriguing characters, like Anya, were not in the book nearly enough and I think if they did less with Spike they could have fit these characters into the story.The biggest thing I disliked about the book was the outcome of the rival gang. It was too quick. The series spent three books leading up to this event and the end was rushed, incomplete, and quite ridiculous. I don't want to give away too much, but why would Buffy and her friends risk gunfire and such? (..)There were good parts to the book. I enjoyed the Buffy/Angel interaction. Cordy was written in a way very true to her character. I like the bond Willow and the bruja have formed. I think the story had the feel and texture of the show. It just didn't compare to the first two stories. I do not recommend this book unless you really want to know what the outcome of the first two books are.
For Years, there have been rumors that The Plastic Man Comedy Show would be released on DVD.In 2009, Warner Bros. has made the rumor come true!Plastic Man: The Complete Collection is stretching as a 4-disc set, on September 1, 2009!This a perfect way to celebrate 30 years, since The Plastic Man Comedy/Adventure Show!
I have seen this great Hanks/Denzel movie so many times on cable I decided to just buy it. And I still watch it .
Interesting story, but the writing is distractingly bad. Instead of being a gripping tale of comedy and chaos, this book reads like wannabe Hungarian noir.
This is the ONLY Cathe workout I have- and I want many more! When I first tried it I got very frustrated with all the steps, because they are not basic, but after doing this workout a few more times I caught on quickly and can now do it with ease, but still breathing hard! I have been working out for 5 years now, doing home workouts and started doing Step aerobics in December. I would say I am advanced in aerobics and kicboxing and Cathe is definately advanced in most of her workouts. I would highly recommend this dvd, as I am sure I would any of her workouts ( even though I have yet to order another)Good intervals too with cardio and weight- this is a total body workout!
Danny Kenny(James Cagney)and his pal,Mutt(Frank McHugh)are truck drivers in New York.Dannys brother,Eddie(Arthur Kennedy)is a promising concert panio player.Dannys girl Peggy Nash(Ann Sheridan)is in love with him,but wants to be a dancer at all costs.She meets Murray Burns(Anthony Quinn)a big time dancer who promises her he can put her on top.Murray and Danny have little use for each other.Out of the pen comes Googi Sabittini(Elia Kazan)a gangster who grew up with Danny and Peggy.Soon Danny becomes a fighter working for promoter Scotty MacPherson(Donald Crisp)After a crooked fight where Dannys eyes are badly injured,Peggy feels terrible about leaving Danny because of her selfish ambitions of wanting to be a dancer and running away with Murray.Great Film.DONT MISS.John Garfield was the first pick to play Dannys brother Eddie.
I've had a wireless network in my house for years with Belkin and Linksys gear, and there were always problems. I finally spent the money for the Apple gear. Problems solved. It just flat out works. Great coverage, easy setup, good security, no issues. It just sits there and works. Fabulous!
This book is organized wonderfully and points out all of the fallacies of the pro-abortion/pro-infanticide stance. I refer to it in one of the chapters of a pro-life book I am writing about how not only the unborn human beings but newborn and infants have been dehumanized by the "legal non-person" pro-abortion argument. Now we see the return of eugenics, where people sue because they had a baby with Down syndrome, such as wrongful life and wrongful birth lawsuits and where whole organs are used from aborted children for research. Great book!The only thing I would vehemently disagree with is where he defends not allowing abortion in the case of rape or incest. It was not the woman or girl's choice to have sex so she should have a choice to get cleaned out after a rape, even if a conception, and therefore new human life, has already formed. This is less than one percent of abortions anyway, and if leftists let us keep rapists and murderers in jail that would be less of a problem. The right of a raped person to get cleaned out from a rape outweighs any right a 2-hour old embryo does to life. It is sad but forcing a raped girl to carry to term is inhumane.That said, 99 percent of abortions are currently for convenience (the mother wants to go on a ski trip, for example) or for eugenic reasons, like the father was ugly or the unborn child has a fixable cosmetic flaw such as cleft lip.see www.culturejamforlife.com
This huge tome, written in the 16th century by Henry Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim, is a gathering together of ideas from a myriad of scholarly sources describing the role of magic in the Universe. Largely drawn from Greek, Roman and Bibilical sources, the philosophy -- later recanted by Agrippa when in danger of falling into accustaion of heresy from the still influential Catholic Church -- is the cornerstone of Western Magic. Indeed, it was very influential with such 19th century occultists as Francis Barrett (The Magus), Lord Bulwer-Lytton, the Goldern Dawn and OTO.Each book describes a facet of occult philosophy in a differnt focus. Book I describes the occultism of the physical world and relies much on neo-platonic thought. Book II deals with the Cellestial world, with a heavy focus on astrology. Book III deals with the world of the divine with a heavy Judeo-Christian philosophy.While many of the ideas put forth appear rediculous today, relying on the validity of heresay evidence and the reknown of the sources he uses, it is interesting to see how, despite the knowledge of empiricism at that time, the word of the Church and Greco-Roman Philospohers are accepted with little question to validity.Much of this massive book, minute in detail with the space given to the editor's footnotes often exceeding that of the chapters of the original text itself, will prove tedious and silly. And yet, one can find gems of wisdom as well as an understanding of the progression of scholarly thought in the West at that period.A tue occultist will delight in the detailed description of the correspondences and the orginal thought behind why one thing such as Mars, is associated with another such as the color red. But while today we may see this all as mere symbolism, back then they really believed there was a true physical or spiritual link between such objects.One of the benefits of this version of the Occult Philosphy is the bibliographical dictionary at the end of the book, compiling short sketches of most of the famous and obscure philosophers, historians and other writers whose works Agrippa cites in his text.
I had to shake my head when I read one of the reviews expressing disappointment, even though the reviewer's disappointment was due to misinformed expectations. I hasten to add, however, that that misinformation is likely not the reviewer's fault.The ultimate authority for American English, the Merriam Webster Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged, defines "flamenco" as "a vigorous rhythmic dance style of the Andalusian Gypsies," or "a dance in this style," or "music or song accompanying or suitable to accompany such a dance..."Contrast that with the ultimate authority on the Spanish language in Spain, the Diccionario de la Lengua Espa&ntilde;ola, published by the Royal Spanish Academy. Among many other meanings, it gives this definition of the art: "[as an adjective] Indicating that which is Andalusian and which tends to reflect Gypsy characteristics. [as a noun] - Andalusian song or singing, the style or feeling, [of] the category FLAMENCO." (My own translation.) So note carefully: In its country of origin, "flamenco" is first and foremost a type of singing, not dance or guitar; it is "Andalusian" and not just "Gypsy" (which is included in the idea of "Andalusian"); and it literally goes without saying that dance and guitar are included.Considering Merriam Webster's misinformation, it's no surprise that the disappointed reviewer criticized this album as showcasing the singing rather than the guitar - even though it doesn't: when the singing is up-front on an album the guitar stands well to the back, not what Paco does here. But it remains that the singing IS flamenco. That's part of what makes Paco so flamenco: He is the most "complete" guitarist in flamenco's history. He knows accompaniment backwards and forwards, both for the singing and the dance; his rhythm is always driving and flawless; his technique is complete and unexcelled; and he has incredible creativity. But what keeps that creativity so "flamenco" is Paco's thorough knowledge of the singing. In fact, there's never been a flamenco guitar soloist worth a damn who was not first an accompanist.This album is superb, probably the finest album Paco's put out since the seventies. It combines old with new in wonderfully subtle ways, and is filled with surprises even for the most knowledgeable aficionados - but that was obviously one of Paco's goals in doing this album. For example, even though Paco has complete mastery of all the many flamenco guitar techniques, the one for which he is most noted is his powerful yet blindingly fast picado ("scale runs"). Yet on this album he hardly uses any - and it STILL rocks! The thumb technique on the first cut, one of several buler&iacute;as, is both mind-boggling and just incredibly "flamenco". It is in this first cut that the singing tells us something: The last verse says that there's an impromptu party with seven people, some to sing, some to dance, and Uh Oh! we forgot to bring a guitarist. "No problem" Paco joins in the chorus, "just play hand claps!" (The hand clapping in flamenco is an art in itself and requires a thorough knowledge of the particular rhythms - and Paco's right, you can accompany everything without guitar just using hand claps.)The second cut, the title cut and a tangos, begins so simply but builds to explosive proportions. (The flamenco tangos are derived from Afro-Cuban rhythms brought back to Spain in the 19th century, very different from the Argentine variety.) The Gypsy singer says "for as much as you loved me, for as much as you adored me, and as much as I used to value that, now I value nothing; so the pains that you give me are not pains but good little things (`cositas buenas')".The third is a sole&aacute; por buler&iacute;a with incredible power and texture. Here Paco sings again to his own accompaniment, for as his song tells us, "Neither pain nor joy can exist without song, so that's why there's more singers than drops of water in the sea and grains of sand in the desert." The fourth and last cuts are the obligatory rumbas for the crowds - excellent but still my least favorites, and are certainly the least "flamenco" on the album. The fifth cut is my personal favorite, a meticulously metered buler&iacute;a that is filled with surprises and joy - you can actually feel the smiles of Paco and his accompanists. The seventh cut is also a buler&iacute;a, but with Tomatito as second guitarist (and Paco is the only guitarist for whom Tomatito will play second guitar) accompanying a previously unpublished recording of the deceased Camar&oacute;n - rather spooky, and with more never before done flourishes on the guitar, this time using rasgueados. And the sixth cut is a tiento (a type of slow, slightly differently inflected tango) done in a manner that is completely different than any tiento done before. It's a revelation in itself, and the singer, El Cigala, returns to the theme of the album: "Come sit at my side because I have to tell you about an ocean of good little things."So there's nothing on this album to be disappointed about. It's filled with surprises for the die-hard aficionado - but those surprises are completely lost unless the listener has a sufficient base of knowledge against which to compare. This is not Paco with DiMeola and McLaughlin, which period in Paco's career was actually a segue for the purpose of expanding his own knowledge. Paco wanted to learn jazz and other concepts since he had done everything in flamenco and needed to be revitalized. He brought those ideas back to the fold of flamenco, refined and then reshaped them. Rhythmically, jazz and rock had little to offer flamenco - actually, quite the reverse. What jazz in particular did have to offer was a great harmonic expansion, and Paco has taken full advantage of that knowledge, transforming and tremendously enlarging flamenco's harmonic scope in the process. And now he has completely absorbed that knowledge and brings to us these wonderful, "good little things," these Cositas Buenas.
I recently received an 8 in 1 as a gift. it looks really cool however it is lacking in the rigidly area. the screw drivers should have more of a 'click' when they are opened to keep them from folding in when pushing hard on the screw driver. Also a spring to assist in the opening of the pliers would be great to allow for one handed usage. In conclusion if you are going for something that will pimp out your key chain go for this. however, if you want a quality piece of equipment buy a leatherman or a gerber
...besides Merzbow and Wolf Eyes this band could probably be one of the noisiest harsh noise (out of this genre...in others I may have heard louder) I have heard...it has a rather nice complexity that uses the power of transforming the instrument into sounding like modern day items that are discarded from children (e.g. Musicbox reference in track one) to represent the loss of innocence in this world (either that or I'm trying to find meaning when there's nothing there)...but tracks like "The Raven" represent their relentless and butchering sound that just constantly screeches and tears at your skin like a trapped Raven (surprise, surprise) stripped of it's pride... songs like "Birthstone" are alot more gradual in it's noise of excruciation and slowly turns you inside out with it's ambience and exploding static screech of a speaking voice......I haven't heard any more of their work but this has encouraged me to explore it...for fans of ambient noise of the highest quality...campaign to make everything music!!!P.S If you want to see what this music can really do to your mind try listening to it while meditating (Tantric or Vajrayana is preferable)...
Excellent production. Superb content. Inspirational observations and elegant, simple, beautiful metaphors. Worth listening to again and again and again.
You want a book that will translate into real terms how the Roman army conquered the world, no other book does a better explanation. Well put together, cool illustrations, food for thought. Great stuff.
In general, the show is very intelligent with a terrific cast and good premise. The general writing is not bad. However, it is easy to see how it was cancelled from network TV. The writing lacks a certain charm or wit. The characters are well designed, but then both the characters and actors are abandoned, the talent and potential wasted. Anything positive comes from the actors on that front, who are all quite good, especially Brent Spiner. Although the stories in themselves tend to be interesting, a lack of cleverness or wit in dialogue or presentation leaves the viewer rather bored. The average viewer who doesn't enjoy acting in itself, or the science (which ranges from good to groan) would not tune in more than once or twice.It's too bad. With a better editing/writing/producing group this could have been a fun show. Worth tuning in to see Brent Spiner and Peter Dinklage, though, if even for just one epsisode.
Terrible, such a sad lazy rip off! The first one still makes me laugh, this one just makes me want my 4 dls. back.
Let's get one thing straight here people. The boy was not naked in the tub. Of course you saw him take off his clothes, but you never saw anything above the knees. He was wearing a bathing suit I'm sure. Child Services people are present at EVERY film where there are minors involved. End of that subject.This could have been a great movie if the boy had been just a little bit older. Even 18 would have done the trick. What point was it to have a 10 year old in that situation? The acting was great, but the whole premise was totally lost in the cradle and highchair robbing being done by the character of Nicole Kidman.Run away together? In 11 years you'll be 21? Give me a break!I gave this movie two stars only because the other actors has the guts to show up.
Being the second book I've ever read of Alexis Harrington's, it's easy to say that she captures happily ever after like nobody's business. A Taste of Heaven is exactly that and if you're in the mood for an engaging, sweetly developed, romantic and sometimes frustrating coming together of two damaged souls, look no further.Liberty "Libby" Garrison has had a very rough life. Growing up as an orphan after the death of her mother, she finds a nice position as a cook for a wealthy Chicago family only to be betrayed. Having no offers of employment, she agrees to travel to Montana as a mail order bride, except when she gets there, her alleged 30 year old husband to be is actually 70 and ailing and scams her into a marriage so he doesn't end up dying alone. Penniless, Libby has no choice but to wait out his death and weather the rough Montana winter until she can get back to town to catch a train back to Chicago. Unfotunately, her husband left her no better off than when she started so when she goes to purchase a ticket home, it turns out she can't afford it and is forced to find work. This leads her to the Lodestar ranch where the cowboys are in desperate need for a cook. When Libby agrees to cook for them, everyone is thrilled. Everyone, except the ranch owner Tyler who's dealing with too much baggage from his past to have Libby distracting him.This was a great story and Libby is a wonderful heroine that tempers a very grumpy Tyler in some entertaining scenes. Ms. Harrington brings you to the edge where you simply want to smack Tyler around and encourage Libby to leave town, but she manages to pull it back together in the nick of time. The secondary characters are all wonderful and the dynamics seem to work and although there's so much happening, it doesn't overpower the main plot. Although it's not particularly original in it's premise, it's a very fast and enchanting read. Somehow, you manage to go through the story and simply feel good, even though the events are supposed to be sad or tense, there's just something about her writing style that inspires hope and everything is fine.
I was a fan of the campy "Batman" of the 60's. I loved Bruce Timm's vision in "Batman: The Animated Series"; although the original episodes borrowed their look heavily from Tim Burton's movie, the characters were well-developed (consider the time spent introducing Two-Face or Mr. Freeze), and the series evolved over time to create an excellent atmosphere with great story-telling.Unfortunately, none of this is present in "The Batman". This series is mediocre in many regards - Bruce Wayne comes across as a weak, forgettable character, and the villains are nothing to write home about (although I did like the fact that they re-designed many of them, they just don't seem to work in any regard). The dialogue is inane as well.Not a strong offering...
My wife and I saw this movie in the theater. While the movie was only 102 minutes long, it seemed more like 102 hours. When the movie ended I was so angry that I didn't just want my money back, I wanted revenge. I'm only sorry that I have to give this movie a star. This movie doesn't deserve a whole star. 1/2 star would be generous.
Plot Summary: San Francisco private detective Samuel Spade is visited by a gorgeous redhead who needs to have a man tailed. When his partner is killed on the job, Spade becomes the prime suspect, and he must solve the case or take the fall. Fortunately Spade is crafty, cunning, and absolutely ruthless. His clients lie to him left and right, but he slowly learns about the mythical Maltese Falcon, a statue of immeasurable worth that is at the center of the maelstrom. While trying to solve the case, Spade must battle his inner demons over the beautiful, but treacherous, Brigid O'Shaughnessy.Samuel Spade is one of the most iconic characters in detective fiction. Described as a `blond satan,' he is the ultimate anti-hero; nominally he is the `good guy' but only because he's the star of the story. He's really quite a bastard. Spade becomes entangled in a frustrating murder mystery where all the players know each other, and they never tell the truth. This is my second reading of The Maltese Falcon, and even when I know what's coming, it's still an utter pleasure to read.I miss these days of trench coats and fedoras, of taxi cabs and hotel detectives, of polite manners and satin evening gowns. Setting this story in San Francisco is just the icing on the cake, because the city itself is beautiful, but it's also dark, wet, and mysterious. It's the perfect setting for a detective who must face everything alone, where the police, his own clients, and his enemies all lie in wait to turn Spade into their victim. No wonder he doesn't trust anybody.Dashiell Hammett's writing style is sleek and spare. There are no rambling paragraphs, no bloated descriptions, nothing that interrupts the rapid-fire dialog and simple prose. Being a true vintage crime story, Mr. Hammett doesn't affect the time period - he lives and breathes it. The dialog crackles with words and phrases that have since passed into obscurity, but it all comes to life again within these pages. The Maltese Falcon is only 20 years shy of being 100-years-old, but it is completely relevant for contemporary readers. That in itself is a remarkable feat, and it is a must read for any crime or noir fan.
This is really a mini-album, none of these tracks are found on White Lilies Island - even Beauty On The Fire, which appears as a Radio Mix.Beauty On The Fire ***** - The best Natalie song.Broken Thread *** - Not very special (a bit boring).Standing There ***** - Very sweet song.Cold Air **** - Good song.The best thing is the video...... Natalie on the beach and diving to a underwater party. To watch many times!
This is a show with some realism unlike most shows out there, who think they have to be strange to be good.
But they really do. I had a boar's hair brush before this, and the badger bristles really are far superior. It takes a lot less soap to make a good lather with the badger. If you're a brush user, definitely give it a try.
THis book offered everything I needed to guide me emotionally and spiritually for getting through trying to conceive. Every time I started to feel hopeless, a friend getting pregnant and me still TRYING, another negative pregnancy test, etc. I could turn to this book and find a moment that I could relate to. SHe covers it all - there's something in this book for everyone. Her journey is inspiring and comforting, giving hope for your personal infertility struggles. The prayers are written out and help guide your personal time with God. I recommend this book to ANYONE who is hurting and desires to find peace and comfort through God.
"A Christmas Story" takes me back to when I was a young boy. We walked to Central Grade School in several feet of snow in the winter. There were no school busses to keep us warm and toasty. Mom packed my lunch and I carried it to school in a tin Superman lunch box, or a brown paper bag from the Kroger store on the corner of the block. A Christmas gift of a Daisy air rifle was a boy's passage to becoming a responsible young man. We didn't shoot at one another or damage anybody's property because we knew when we went home that evening the "Old Man" would find out from a neighbor. Then I would certainly get a spanking and would loose my privilege of playing with my shiny new Daisy air rifle. This time in Americana was the best time for children to learn and live the values which produced the "Greatest Generation" who built the American dream. The neighborhoods were safe for children to play outside and have snowball battles and sled ride down "Suicide Hill." The modern world with both parents working and children being housed in daycare, or raised by a village, has created a tear in the fabric of the family. I really feel sorry for the children of today because they have not lived "A Christmas Story." That's such a shame....Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.Kind regards,Don_
Wayne Dyer cleverly takes 60 philosophical and poetic gems, explains the significance of each and discusses ways to apply to everyday situations. Each gem is discussed in 4-6 pages, making this daily reading experience easy to work into the busiest of schedules. A nice sample of various thoughts that may inspire further readings. Regardless, a thought provoking book.
Crashes my computer on windows 7 and crashes intermittently on Windows XP.Very disappointing for me and my kids.
I love this canner. Since I have to make my own stock and can other things due to food sensitivities, I find this canner easy to use and clean.
If you love film, this is a DVD you must own, and if you already own the old version this is one case where upgrading is an absolute necessity, the difference is staggering.I've never seen a DVD that was more of an improvement over a previous release. The colors explode off the screen from this razor sharp anamorphic transfer, which finally presents the film in its original aspect ratio.If you have the old Fox Lorber disc, find the nearest bonfire or trash compactor, because that's the only place suitable for it.I took some comparison captures of the two discs on my computer and the results are astonishing. The old disc swears it's from the 1994 restored version, but I find that hard to believe. The colors are faded beyond belief and there's a deep blue tint to the whole film that's instantly visible when you compare it to this new Koch Lorber version.In addition, the old Fox Lorber DVD suffered from a problem common to videos of European films. In Europe they use the PAL color system for their televisions rather than NTSC, which we use here. PAL has higher resolution, but runs at a different speed and requires films to be sped up by 4% to match it.There's a long technical explanation, but basically they found a way around this for NTSC. The end result is that films in PAL are about five minutes shorter than they should be. There's nothing missing they're just moving at a higher speed than intended, causing everything to move ever so slightly faster and voices and music to go to a higher pitch.The old DVD was from a PAL master, so it was 1hr 27 mins long and had the flicker in the image that usually results from a PAL to NTSC conversion.The new DVD is a true NTSC version, so you finally get to see Umbrellas at its proper length of 1hr 32mins. Again, there are no restored scenes or anything, it's merely being run at the correct speed at last. Still, that means five extra minutes of eye-popping color, glorious music and Catherine DeneuveKoch Lorber deserves major, enormous, gigantic congratulations for finally doing right by this cinema classic and giving it the DVD it deserves. Bravo!
Easy to understand. You don't have to read cover to cover to find the info you need. Very will thought out.
I have followed Jean-Luc for over 20 years, and never stops amazing me!His latest give more feeling and beat than the last few albums. He delivers much better live, but this is one of his best studio albums! He has a top notch band right now on this album, and he has toured with them extensively.A must have for any JLP or jazz fan!
The title of my review essentially speaks the truth Ray invested a lot into this product and has an affinity for the Fleischer's work and is the undisputed expert of all things Fleischer. This package not only has added sound effects and scores to enhance the quality but the picture quality is well ahead of most other distributed/publicly seen versions of Out of the Inkwell. Even though Ray should be credited for resurrecting the classics the cartoons have to hold their own as well which they essentially do. Ray's talents for preserving classic cartoons could only do so much if the classic cartoons were mediocre. I see this set as a team-effort, have exceptional material to work with and then take the initiative to preserve it and enhance the quality with sound-effects, music, and picture quality. The annecedotes that he discusses inbetween segments are insightful but are fairly basic in comparison to what Ray really knows. Based on viewing his posting history the man himself can get a lot more intricate than what is seen on here, though it might be affiliated with not trying to go above peoples heads.The penmanship is superb and second to none in the nineteen-twenties especially after the entrance of Dick Huemer in 1923. It is a sad state of affairs to see how much potential the brothers had and was unrealized because of how far they fell in the thirties a lot more could have materialized that didn't and this set shows what they had going for them. They were overly dependent upon Paramount who was more interested in commercially exploiting them than allowing them to artistically progress. One wonders if the cold personality of Adolph Zukor had watched these shorts collectively he might have had a change of heart and allow the Fleischer's to grow. Ray obviously brings back the spirit as if your at a silent movie house amidst the 1920's.It is interesting to see the company artistically evolve through out the twenties. When the series initiates in 1919 we essentially see the brothers experiment with themes to showcase the capabilities of the rotoscope obviously shorts like Perpetual Motion convey their affinity for science and technology. The Oujia Board is essentially a mainstay in silent animation but the Fleischer's execute with much greater fluidity and grace. They become less technically limiting by 1923 with the arrival of Dick Heumer and arguably hold the technological lead in the industry by a large margin until the rise of Disney.We see them reach their peak in the mid-twenties, than Alfred Weiss taking over showcases a noticeable shift in the films and the end to this remarkable series ends. Though this was arguably one of the most influential series in American Animation history. Walt himself was partly motivated to join the industry under this series, when taking that into consideration it was obviously pervasive and possibly the most unsung series in animation history. Its importance is just as great if not greater than how unknown it is. Ray has the best prints so if you go to any source to buy definitive silent animation please make it Inkwell Images.
I met the author at Haslam's in St. Petersburg and she promptly introduced me to her book. I assumed that it was a non-fiction book since she had notebooks of newspaper articles on which the book is based and had said that she'd personally known the parties involved. Sadly, after she signed my copy, I learned it was a fictional account of the crime. At this point, I obviously had to buy the book.Sadly, this book screams, &quot;Look, I couldn't find a real publisher so I did it all by myself.&quot; The cover is contrived and garish. The interior is not designed and is largely unreadable and the author photo is too dark and shows (eeekkk!) her cleavage.Once home, I hoped for a mediocre story and a semi-enjoyable read. After the first two pages, I found evidence of neither. The opening scene is trite and predictible. What bothered me the most though was the lack of good editorial work. There were several misplaced commas on the first two pages alone. Puh-leeze! If you are going to self-publish, please hire a good freelance copy editor and pay them what they are worth.This book is a waste and is going directly to the Salvation Army donation center.
My experience of Rilke is that most translations fall somewhere between "not very good" and "extremely awful." I have to say, even with low expectations, this book is disappointing. It's poorly translated and contains glaring typographical errors.Kidder follows the rhyme scheme often but not always. Consider this baffling choice: "Du Dunkelheit, aus der ich stamme / ich liebe dich mehr als die Flamme" is rendered as "You darkness whence I came, / I love you more than the light."What the huh? "Flamme" not only means flame, and not light, but "flame" rhymes with "came."Joana Macy renders Rilke's "Ich liebe meines Wesens Dunkelstunde" as "I love the dark hours of my being." Kidder opts for "I love the hours when I'm blue, depressed."I actually purchased this book for the German, not the translations, but the situation is not much better there. In the first line of a well-known and often-quoted poem from this collection, on the very first page, the book has "Ich lebe mein Leben ich wachsenden Ringen," instead of "Ich lebe mein Leben in wachsenden Ringen." This error is roughly on the order of "To boy or not to be."A few pages later we get "Nachbarschft." Have you no copy editors, Northwestern University Press?This book is an embarrassment.
from BlueJeanOnline.comby Emily Stoddard, age 15, Sr. CorrespondentI had been highly anticipating Jewel's newest release, 0304, ever since I heard about it earlier in the year. When I actually got a listen and a look at the new Jewel, however, I was shocked by the studio-manufactured sound and a Cosmo-inspired pop look. Hoping that my early observations were misguided, I was still counting on Jewel's 0304. Then the infamous "Intuition" razor commercial. Yes, the same woman who defends her songs as touting anti-commercialism messages actually sells out... to a new razorblade. Jewel was defending her "Intuition" music video's sexualized images as parodies of commercialism, but meanwhile she was profiting from commercialism. The irony of this left me shaking my head in front of the television. My hopes for the forthcoming 0304 were disappearing as quickly as Jewel's devotion to her principles.Regardless of whether Jewel contradicts herself with her take on commercialism, there is no avoiding the fact that the album lacks substance and musicality. With the arrival of 0304, I could be sure my uncertainty about Jewel's new direction was not based on empty assumptions. The beat of this album not only takes Jewel far from her humble, true-to-self roots, but it also takes listeners to a very different sound.Time and effort could have been saved if only Jewel and co-producer Lester A. Mendez had double-checked their redundancy. Jewel uses the images of the good guy being bad, street corners, simple girls, and Abercrombie-wearing Americans over and over again to make what is already a cliche point: our society has some issues. While these are issues of concern, Jewel fails to do anything new with them, both in general and within the context of the album. If you want to hear "America," for instance, you only need to hit repeat on "Stand."Jewel's lyrics read like amateur poetry of a pubescent, angst-driven teenager. In her letter to fans (however many are left after 0304), Jewel promises "a record that [is] lyric-driven." Consider the following from "Fragile Heart": "If u want my heart/U have 2 promise not 2 tear it apart/'Cause my heart/Has been hurt a lot/And it always seems/Love is not sweet, like in dreams." Lyrics like this, which spot 0304, could be considered an insult to Jewel's intelligence.After all, previous Jewel albums have gifted listeners with interesting perspectives on love and challengenges in the human relationship. Apparently Jewel's new look, doused in pastel and accented by much more skin, is a window into the trite approach Jewel maintains on 0304. The album is redeemed by harsher songs like "Haunted," which has an awkward beginning but settles into a raw sound. "Leave the Lights On" is a unique sound for Jewel, and its simple lyrics are maximized in the framework of a cool band sound. Here too, however, Jewel struggles to make 0304 unique. "Leave the Lights On" is reminiscent of many a Fiona Apple track, leaving fans wishing that Jewel would tap into the unique style that made her a favorite in the first place.All in all, 0304 is a failed experiment for Jewel. I wouldn't be surprised if the superficial songs ended up as background music for countless cheap romantic comedies. They certainly won't be the background music for me anytime soon, though. I'll count on previous Jewel releases for that, and I'll bet other Jewel fans will do the same.Copyright 2003 BlueJeanOnline.com
hmmm i like screamo and all but ive heard these songs before. its another example of a major label exploiting a samll town band in a desperate attempt at finding the next big thing, and who would have known, the big label has yet again screwed another young band. its a real shame.
There are many good Christian books on marriage, and A Sacred Foundation takes its place among them. The authors share an alternating discussion of his needs and her needs. The wife needs her husband's leadership, gentleness, compassion, protection, provision, praise and support. The husband needs his wife's allegiance, affection, beauty, companionship, and mature love. While this is true in all marriages (particularly for those who desire to follow Christ), these needs effect the homeschool marriage even more. Homeschooling is a worthwhile, dedicated, challenging, and exhausting commitment. The marriage relationship is vital to it's survival, but can too easily be back-burnered with the demands of the life style. This book is a great guide and help for both successful and hurting marriages, as parents team up to provide a home education for their children.
This is just a fabulously entertaining television series -- funny and sweet. Although the seasons are short compared to US Shows (This set has 7 episodes), they're enjoyable enough that they're worth it. (Great things come in small packages.) Here's a quick summary of the episodes:1. Jean suspects Lionel is going deaf, but he resists going to the doctor. Meanwhile, Lionel becomes convinced that Jean is having problems with her eyes.2. Jean & Lionel take a parental interest in Harry, Sandy's policeman boyfriend. Yet the affairs of the younger generation seem to diminish in importance when Jean receives a phone message from an old flame.3. Jean undertakes some strategic snooping to discover what the new neighbors are like. How is it they show up at the pub with black eyes?4. The whole gang heads out to the country for the weekend. But road construction is about to throw the travelers for a loop.5. Jean's brother, Stephen, and his wife are expected for another visit. To the Hardcastles' surprise, they arrive via separate modes of transportation to announce that they are having a tiff.6. Jean gets everyone, including Lionel's father and stepmother, to help out with her old-age party at the church hall. Lionel is anxious about the whole idea, especially after being told to watch out for Mrs. Thrupp.7. The Duncans abruptly vacate the dwelling next door, and Judith has the wonderful idea that she and Alistair move in. Lionel has his reservations, but they are nothing compared to the reservations of Judith when Alistair makes a surprising proposal.
This box is fantastic, amazing 80's songs!!! An interesting compilation of a lot of groups from the manignif era!!! Enjoy, probable you never will see these bands together in a box again!!! amazing!!!
This is a fantastic book. The only complaint I had was that when I finished reading it I wanted more. It is about the Driftless Area of southwestern Wisconsin. The beauty of the area, it's wildlife and mystique. Written by a man who truly appreciates it.I believe that the driftless area has some of the prettiest landscape in the world. But it is a beauty that is subtle and in a way masculine. It is very evident in the rock formations and rolling forested hills, but it also hides in the details of small creeks forming numerous miniature waterfalls as they tumble their way to the Mississippi River. John Motoviloof captures all of this in a way that only someone who found the area later in life probably could.Dan Small, a local outdoor writer says it best in his review of the book. "Spare and rugged, yet rich in detail and meaning, like the special region it takes as it's subject, 'Driftless Stories' is a special book."
This movie is pointless and boring. Plot really goes nowhere and certainly not entertaining or funny. I was highly dissapointed based on the previous reviews.
I've bought and used several BoxWave products and never had a problem. However, the shield for this camera is about 1/16" short horizontally. Not worth going the trouble of buying a competitive product, but I'm disappointed with the fit.
What do you look for in an anim&eacute;?Cute girls? Check.Lots of comedy/silliness? Check.Cool spaceships? Check.Super/special powers? Check.Catchy/cool opening/closing music? Check.An interesting and well developed storyline? Check.It just doesn't get much better than this. This anim&eacute; is one of the best ones I have come across in a long time. My only complaint is that they are too short! Each episode everages about 12 minutes. I understand that this is because this is a &quot;mini&quot; anim&eacute; taken from a larger composite show from when it was originally made in Japan. But, at least they include 7 episodes on the disk.Check this anim&eacute; out if you are into anim&eacute; at all. It is going to be in the running for the best anim&eacute; released in 2004.
Even an Eminem fan would be hard pressed to say that this was one of his better efforts. Although I don't own any of his albums, the last two have gotten a lot of respect from me. Hands down, Em's gonna go down as one of the greats. But, on this album there are a couple basic problems that would make you feel otherwise.Drastically different from his other albums, his hooks have gotten to the point where they just plain suck. He's adapted this sing-a-long style that will work for a couple of tracks, but has gotten old REAL fast. So, in between his break-neck verses the feel is often ruined by whatever he tries to do with the chorus. If he were smart enough, he'd put Nate Dogg on here more or get Busta Rhymes who's recently had an incredible streak with sick hooks.Secondly, he really hasn't advanced very far in his subject matter. There's the same old typical songs: Hali, Kim, Bush, Fans (If 2Pac had a "Dear Mamma" on every album wouldn't it lose some value???). It's even like his social commentary has halted in growth, it's barely current at all. Besides the ill-timed "Mosh" (released after Bush's re-election pretty much defeats the song), there's barely any truly justified anger. He resorted to potty jokes all too much on here. "Rain Man" is really the only comical song that I can handle on this album (if only for his bold verse about the deceased Chris Reeves). Most great artists tend to grow and I'd expect him to really take advantage of the current state of society, but Em in most cases just chooses not too.Finally, he wastes some vicious Dre beats. It's simple enough, but with Detox being delayed it's safe to say everyone would like Dre's tracks to be used a little better.I'd rather not go through track by track and repeat what I just said for each song. Fact is these problems seem to re-occur again and again throughout the album.Despite all the faults, this album has some huge strengths. "Never Enough" (great Dre beat) & the 8Mile esq. "Yellow Brick Road" both start the album off in a huge way. "Spend Some Time" has every guest on point lyrically and is surprisingly personally revealing (except for 50's pointless last verse). All these songs are solid in production, show a great display of lyrics and really are void of any of the faults that plague this album.Finally, it's worth mentioning that "Encore", track 20, has got to be one of the SICKEST Dr. Dre songs ever. The thumping beat and the way he uses violin in the background is spectacular. Thankfully Em doesn't disappoint either, and displays here exactly why he's considered as one of the best. Em & Dre are both crazy on point and tag-team better than they ever have before (although it was prolly for the best, but what happened to 50 on here?). It's almost worth getting this album just for this song. At the same time it's disappointing the rest of the album couldn't even touch the status of this finale.While Encore is definitely disappointing, it certainly won't hurt Em's status, skills, sales, or legacy. The highlights of this album should be enough to keep fans busy until his next effort, but others (such as myself) should prolly hold off on making this purchase.(5/10)
Haven't bought the album because I don't waste money. J-Kwon is a no talent piece of trash from St.Louis like Chingy. Do the world a favor and stop. Your songs are horrible. I could rap better. People who like you need to get their heads examined.
When i went to see the Southpark movie I had no idea it was going to be a musical. I was taken aback by the quality and creativity of the music.OK - the lyrics are not always for the faint of heart, but they are catchy. You will find yourself humming many of the tunes as they become stuck in your head.As with any album, I have found some tracks I can play over and over; with others, once was enough. A friend of mine (with a PhD. in Musicology) became a Southpark fan after hearing this album.
My parents had this record when I was growing up. A few years ago my sister found the CD and told me about it and I bought it last year. It really brings back some great memories when I listen to the music.This CD is a definite holiday MUST!!
Pimsleur is like a car that can go from zero to 20 instantly. Not bad, right? Problem is, the speed of this car tops out at 25.I bought Pimsleur's beginning Arabic course based on their ubiquitous animated ad that promises that in just ten days using Pimsleur's method for 30 minutes a day, "with no textbook, no grammar drills, no classes, no flashcards, and without studying any vocabulary at all" I could speak a "perfect, accent-free" foreign language. And this method has been "used by 25 million ecstatically happy people around the world."Does Pimsleur live up to this promise? No, not even close. Do any of us think "accent-free" language in ten days is a rational goal? I don't think so, but Simon & Schuster tarnishes its own reputation as well as Paul Pimsleur's by making the sort of shameless false claims I thought only existed in late-night infomercials.So the product does not fulfill its promises, but does it work at all? Actually, it does a little. It's not 100% snake-oil. After ten days, I had a short menu of fixed phrases in Arabic such as "Good morning", "Excuse me", "Do you know English?", and "I'm not Syrian, ma'am". (Glad to have that last one. If only I had a nickel for every time women have taken me for a Syrian!) Arabic is an intimidating language and even giving me a short menu of things to say with some verve and confidence is a small win. Is it perfect Arabic? No. Is it accent-free? Who are they kidding? Pimsleur Arabic seems often simply to omit sounds that are problematic for native English speakers: compare how Pimsleur's readers say the word "Arabic" (Arabi) compared to any native speaker you can hear on Youtube. Pimsleur just ignores an 'ayin at the beginning. In short, even the goal of "accent-free" Arabic is abandoned from the git-go.In conclusion, the product's advertising is so false, I'm a bit surprised no one has sued the publisher. But is it helpful at all? Sort of. But if you want really to master Arabic, you need something with more structure. Arabic is an interesting language that generally attracts curious, intelligent people. I think they would prefer a more intelligent approach.
DO NOT BUY EPSON PHOTO R220!! PLEASE READ ALL Reasons:1. Approx in one year a window will pop up & message will "EXACTLY" state, "Parts inside your printer are at the end of their service life. See your printer documents". After this window keeps popping up EVERY time you print, approx 2 weeks after your printer will COMPLETELY shut down forcing you to repair/replace the ink waste pads. This can not be done by the consumer, it must be sent in for repair & costs the same as a new printer. You have no choice but to send it for repair or buy a new printer. This only proves that the printer is programmed to shut down for unnecessary repairs. How can any machine know what part to replace & when it is going to wear out unless it has been programmed??!! This is an illegal scam & Epson is begging for ANOTHER class action law suit.2. Each time you turn the R220 off it resets the ink cartridges & goes through an unnecessary cleaning cycle, wasting all your ink. I have noticed that ink levels disappear quickly & even the ones that are not being used, the micro chip attached to each cartridge has to be programmed otherwise why would the levels indicate they are low when ink is not used. I replaced a cartridge that the printer said was out of ink. I opened up the supposedly empty ink cartridge & it was almost 80% full!! I could not believe it, Epson was sued for this same incident on previous printers. Another tip off that they are programmed is that if you install a non Epson ink cartridge a window will pop up saying that, "you are not using an official Epson product, do you wish to continue with ink replacement"? This is not word for word but it is exactly the same message that you get from it. I would of typed exact message but i no longer have this inferior printer.3. If one of your ink cartridges is out, it locks up, forcing you to install a new ink cartridge for further use.4. The colors on your monitor are not what this printer prints. You get variations & some are so bad that it can effect the beauty of your photo.5. The ink that this printer uses is horrible, if ANY moisture comes in contact with printed media from the R220, it WILL run, smear, smudge, etc. Horrible & the ink cartridges are VERY EXPENSIVE!! Approx 70.00 to 80.00 dollars.6. The CD/DVD print tray is so defective in it's style that i can not believe this unit has not been recalled. More than 80% of the time it will not print because of alignment issues. It has to be almost 100% MANUALLY aligned for it to print on CD/DVD media. There is no escaping this, it has to be MANUALLY set.7. Printer has a paper feed problem, it takes standard paper fine but, try loading in a heavy card stock or photo paper & it WILL NOT catch it. It REFUSES to take the heavy weight paper. It SOMETIMES will take it if you feed it in sheet by sheet. A defect that needs to be fixed!!I could go on about this printer but i am getting angry at this point with recollections of the agony i went through with this printer. DO NOT BUY EPSON PRODUCTS, they are inferior & PROGRAMMED to fail for unnecssary repair.

Why on earth would a beautiful, intelligent woman -- the wife of a psychiatrist no less -- risk everything for a feral affair with a psychopath? How could Stella's milquetoast husband be so blind to the needs of his passionate wife? Being a psychiatrist himself, why did he just stand by and watch Stella self-destruct?The author treats each character with a distant sympathy and compassion. He applies to them his insight, understanding and wisdom. And we begin to understand why 'sane' people often act more bizarrely than the psychopath himself. After all, 'sane' is a relative, arbitrary term.Though big pieces of the puzzle are missing or merely touched upon, slowly, slowly, Stella's actions begin to almost make sense. Even so, though you know nothing short of a nuclear attack could stop her, you think, No, you fool!, as Stella marches with fiery fervor straight to her doom.There's lots of foreshadowing and metaphor that weave the story into a whole. The writing is fantastic: I found myself reading phrases and sentences over and over again. The style reminds me of film noire. The psychiatrist whose patient Stella was is the not-quite-unbiased narrator.The first half and end of the book are suspenseful; you can't wait to see how it'll turn out. The middle third or so drags in places, but never for too long.Some may be bored by the landscape of the mind that dominates the story. But if you're excited at the prospect of digging into minds of those who are dangerously unbalanced by overwhelming passion -- obsession beyond obsession -- this book is for you.Again, Mr. McGrath's writing alone makes this book worthwhile. He totally drew me in.
Before I give any kudos to AL let me say this about the BAND STREAM OF PASSION..... THEY ARE SIMPLY AN INCREDIBLE BAND and for those ARYEON fans you WILL get differnent takes on certain classics from the archives from Aryeon and SIMPLY beautiful rendetions from his latest "The Human Equasion" which begs to differ--- when will this genius perform the ELECTRIC CASTLE and THE HUMAN EQUASION in their entirety live in one concert for DVD...but enough of that now let me RAVE about the MAGNIFICENT CONECERT Stram of Passion Put on.... The Incredible Vocals, The Band, The Musicianship...absoutely outstanding...BRAVO to every member in the band and hope to see them on the road and in THE STATES SOON!!!!.... As every AL fan knows everything he touches is absolute MAGIC and this is NO different....completely outstanding in evreyway possible...lets just hope he does decide to use the female singers and guitarest in and upcoming Ayreon solo albums or the like.... My Hats off to ALL Singers and Musicians in SOP.....BRAVO!!!!!!!!!A MUST HAVE FOR ANY SERIOUS COLLECTOR......DO NOT MISS THE ALBUM OR DVD!!!!
I received this album as a surprised gift for christmas and didn't know what to think. As soon as I heard the first track I was sold. Really good music, lyrics, flawless execution. This is the kind of thing a young person just isn't going to write. these guys really know what they are doing and as the singer songer writer alt country type goes this album is really terrific. Better than the more famous ones, I assure you.Several of the songs are pretty dark. This includes Dark Eyed Gal is one of the saddest songs I have ever heard. My favorites are the title track Flycatcher Jack and the Whipporwill's Song. The latter features Probably the best musicianship on the album, quality lyrics (something you get with every song on this one), and haunting vocals. The female backing vocals work perfectly here.One of what I'd guess is hundreds of really great albums recorded in the last decade that I am just now hearing. That is no coincidence either, you will not hear music this good unless you really look for it, so if you are lucky enough to stumble upon this page, buy the album. Really unless you are expecting a heavy metal album you can't go wrong with this one.
(This isn't Joseph.) I am an extreme Harry Potter fan (i've read each of the books at least 3 or 4 times. The Goblet of fire: 7 times) and i believe that this movie was slightly disappointing. They left out the good parts of the movie such as the winning Quiddicth Cup Match with Slytherin, Sirius Black Breaking into the dormitory and frightening Ron, (part of this is shown on disc two), the part when Remus Lupin unfolds the story of his days at Hogwarts with Sirius, James, and Peter, the fact that Harry never found out about the relationship between his Patronus (a stag) and his father, the Maruader's Map wasn't finished telling off Severus Snape when he found it that day, and last, the movie didn't tell why Snape didn't like Harry's father.Also, a part in the movie was out of order (when Harry received the Firebolt), others said lines that didn't belong to them (when Sirius says "the ones that love us never really leave us,". That's Dumbledore's line), and Peter Pettigrew's description didn't match the book's description (ture it said in one of the earlier chapters that he was "a little lump of a boy," but later it says that he looks like a man who lost a lot of weight in a short time, meaning that he should have been skinny.Personally, i believe that Chris Columbus should have directed this movie. Even though he did lend a hand, i think the missing parts would have been filled if he had directed it.The movie was still good, but, if you are expecting it to be just like the book, you may be a little disappointed.
Most of us lament tragedies when the befall ourselves or loved ones. In such times it is difficult not to pose the question &quot;Why me?&quot; Too often we are inclined to resign ourselves to misery rather than attempt to puzzle through the painful experience afflicting ourselves and others. Rabbi Kushner does a wonderful job of gently challenging us to find meaning even in the most difficult and stressing of tragedies. His logic is sound, his heart warm, his exposition and diction clear and assuring. I have given this audiobook as a gift to several of my friends and all have found it comforting and instructive. I highly recommend this audiobook and, in fact, am ordering three copies for our university library.
I hadn't used a night vision device much before, and I got this because I had a little disposable income to dispose of. It really does a good job of bringing vision to the evening darkness, sort of like I imagine a cat or owl would see. To someone who doesn't know what this is or does, it's about as big as your hand, so it's portable. Has zoom feature (click to zoom, release and it's back to normal), brightness adjustment, and focus. A well-made, sturdy device, not flimsy. And it shows you stuff outside when it's dark out and your eyes are hopelessly incapable of gathering enough light to see anything. If you wanted to be in a cave, it'd be nice if you had it there to show you what was around you in the cave. Or I guess in the basement looking to see if that was a mouse running around, without turning on the lights. Maybe you are boating around at night and want a better look at what's ahead. Or the subway stops and all the lights go out (uh, a bit too big to carry around all the time for such a circumstance). Dunno. It really does work to show you things, sorta like a black-white TV image of the world when your eyes can't see a thing. You figure out if you need it.
My 3 year old grandson is fascinated by the car wash feature of this Plan City gas station. Will be adding to his collection for his birthday.
This is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. Moore is brilliant with the camera and with the narrative. He's REALLY done his homework. His interview with Marilyn Manson will be a revelation to many people, although if you're like me and listen to Manson's music, you'll learn nothing new from it. The problems in the film come from how Moore frames the arguement:(1.)It's not the fault of Kmart that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the two boys from Columbine, shot their classmates.Why not interview the Littlerock police departments sherrif and find out why the police didn't intervene when it was discovered that Harris posted death threats and an enemies list on his website BEFORE the shootings and how the police knew about this and did nothing.(2.)It's not Dick Clark's fault that that boy in Michigan shot his classmate. Why not blame the boys uncle--the man who left his gun out? Maybe because the uncle is a poor black man and Clark is a very famous, wealthy white man? See below.(3.)Moore's portrayal of race in America is so biased that it's ridiculous. His whole thesis on the American media conglomerating in an effort to villainise black men is a ridiculous conspiracy theory. I beleive it 100% that the show "Cops" unfairly targets poor people, but it's not a vehicle for publicising the arrests of blacks. His entire emphasis is on "poor,crazy,white middle American gun fanatics", with no concentration at all on inner city gang violence except when he argues that it's mostly a concoction by the racist media....*Note that I'm criticising him for his ideas. In other words, his film making skills were so good that there is nothing bad I can say about them.
I picked this book up because I thought it would be interesting to find out what was in the mind of Rod Ferrell. What I got instead was a wasted $7. Ms. Jones is a very poor writer. The first 150 pages or so kept repeating the same things over and over again. I can't count how many times she wrote that Charity drank Rod's blood. Hello, we get the point. By the time I got to the actual crime itself, I was already frustrated with her lack of narrative and any semblance of chronological order.I do agree with some of the reviewers who said this book portrays kids who role play as bad seeds. I think this is a gross generalization. I also agree with the reviewer who said that it appears as if Ms. Jones was in a hurry to finish the book.I wouldn't waste my money on this one if you can help it.
The first time I watched this anime I had difficulty figuring out how to get it to play and was also shocked by the outrageous cruelty. I eventually, after the third time watching it became adept at mastering the video controls and a greater understanding of the anime. The world of humans became callous and mean spirited and nature fought back by producing a new species whose purpose was to destroy the human race and take over. The new species however had the same flaws as the humans and the conflict between humans and the new species resulted in a twisted ending short of providing a clear understanding. I guess its up to the viewer to decide what happened next. I recommend this movie for everyone -- you'll either love it, hate it or be completely confused by it. You may want to review it first so you can decide whether or not other members of the family should watch it.
even now, months after i read this book, the beauty of it resonants within me. harry is exactly the kind of vulnerable hero i love to read about and desdemona is his equal in both intelligence and wit. the story of how these two come together is wonderful!desdemona is a beautiful orphaned child prodigy living with her grandfather in victorian age egypt. she's very smart, but despite the fact she can read twelve languages, the only one she can speak is english! her humanity is depicted beautifully here, as she's a young woman who reads romance novels and envisions her knight in shining armor will steal her away and take her back to england, a country she hasn't seen since her parents died.harry is a handsome rogue who hides a painful secret that forced him to escape to egypt. he and desdemona have known each other for years as both of them have a gifted knowledge of ancient artifacts. of course there is a competitive relationship between the two, but there is also an endearing friendship, too.when desdemona was seventeen, she tried to seduce harry because she thought she was in love with him. however, he rejected her and since then, she has held some resentment towards him. even though they are friendly towards each other, the rejection always lurks in the back of her mind. despite this, she does lean on harry for friendship and support, moreso than she realizes.meanwhile, harry has been secretly in love with desdemona for years, but has felt himself unworthy of her and has been content to remain friends. that is, until his cousin arrives.when harry's tall, dark, and handsome cousin from england comes to visit, desdemona imagines she has finally met the knight in shining armor she expects to take her back to england. initially harry is reluctant but willing to encourage the relationship between desdemona and his cousin. however, eventually he realizes he can't allow it to happen.desdemona has no idea how harry feels about her and that's what makes this story so enchanting. harry shows his love through his actions, rescuing her in the beginning of the book and then later on when he's competing with his cousin to describe her beauty, gives one of the most romantic and heart-felt descriptions i think i've ever read in a romance novel. there are other moments like that in the book that really set this one apart from others.harry and desdemona have genuine chemistry and brockway is gifted in writing both witty dialogue and poetic descriptions (which at no time turns into the overflowery purple prose you see from other authors). while desdemona tends to find herself in danger at times, she's no idiot, just strong-willed. even though she's a romantic at heart, she's not one of those heroines who waits helplessly for someone to save her. she's very resourceful.there is really only one sexual interaction in this book, although there are plenty of steamy kisses. however, the love scene was both sensual and sweet.brockway is also gifted in her imagery, as she describes egypt in such a way as to make the reader wish she was there to experience it.this book is full of funny moments and the ending will bring a couple of tears to your eyes as it did mine.
When listening to this disc, I thought everything was going great... until I got to the Cowell. I have no beef with Lawrence Gwozdz; he's a fantastic saxophonist, but I was very surprised to hear this recording coming from him. When one listens to this part of the disc, it sounds as if it was recorded sometime in the 60s. In addition, many of the runs in the Husa and the Cowell sound as if they are fudged, more gliss than clean run.The Husa is particularly bad--there are dynamics and very important crescendos--particularly at the climax of the elegie--which are simply ignored. In addition, he takes way too much liberty in his "dramatic pauses," such as right before going into the crazy forth-octave altissimo, completely breaking the rhythmic backbone of the piece, which is a shame in such a vital work as this one. I know he is capable of far better than this--just listen to the version he recorded with the Bohuslav Martinu Philharmonic. It may not be the greatest version I've ever heard , but it is a far more satisfying rendering than this. I think my favorite rendition I've heard is the chamber version by Harry Kinross White, who, one might note, studied with Dr. Gwozdz, but also Sigurd Rascher.The Cowell Air and Scherzo is almost worse. If the acoustics weren't bad enough, the mic placement makes it very obvious where he is stopping one take and starting another in the Scherzo, a major blunder, one almost unheard of in professional recordings.(Try just listen 43 seconds in, and also between the contrasting slow section and the recapitulation). That is what shocked me most about this recording. After hearing it happen so obviously, one can hardly listen to the rest of the cd without hearing it there too: whether 30 seconds into the Worley Sonata's first movement, many, many times in the third movement, or 3 minutes and 15 seconds into the Rondeau of the Husa, these gaping holes seem to be everywhere! It's really a shame, because this is the only recording on the market of the Antique Dances, Particles, Air and Scherzo, and Beyond these hills.It is worth noting that the concerto disc by Gwozdz mostly has different repertoire by the same composers, but also has the Elegie/Rondeau, Romance, and Jephthah that is on this disc, only in orchestral form. The performances are far better, so I would not hesitate to get that disc instead.
